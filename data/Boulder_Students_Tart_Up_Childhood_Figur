							A new trend in Halloween costumes for CU students has become apparent this weekend: slutty nursery rhyme or Disney characters.  At the Republic of Boulder bar Friday night, I saw a woman dressed as Snow White, a character who is apparently no longer as pure as the driven snow, as the woman sported a skirt that looked about 3-inches long. All the better reveal the woman's abundantly ruffled underpants. At Abo's Pizza on the Hill this afternoon, a collection of childhood characters gone bad were lunchingâ€”there was Goldilocks in a tiny skirt, Dorothy in stiletto heels, thigh-high stockings, and a skin-tight gingham mini dress, and an angel in a miniscule tube dress.  What's next, Hot Mother Hubbard?  Nobody's going to be paying attention to the professor in classes this afternoon, that's for sure.

		<p>Ah yes, the latest artifact of the sexualization of childhood in our country. It's bad enough that "Mrs. Santa" has to be a nubile twenty-year-old in the skimpiest possible skirt, but now even the ghoulish undead have cleavage and shapely legs. :-)</p>

							Feminist musicians, artists, filmmakers and activists will flock to Denver this weekend (August 5-7) for the second <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ladyfestoutwest.org/" title="Ladyfest Out West">Ladyfest Out West</a>, whose activities are scheduled to fill a number of venues, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hi-dive.com" title="Hi-Dive">Hi-Dive</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hysteriashop.com" title="Hysteria">Hysteria</a>, Double Entendre and The Pod Gallery.  The inaugural <a target="_blank" href="http://www.Ladyfest.org" title="Ladyfest">Ladyfest</a> was held five years ago in Olympia, Washington, the home of Bikini Kill, one of the primary bands in the 1990â€™s womenâ€™s punk movement that became known as Riot Grrrl. After staging a successful event, Ladyfestâ€™s organizers did something unusual: Instead of focusing on producing an annual Olympia festival, they decided to encourage women in other cities to organize their own grassroots Ladyfests.  Since then, dozens of Ladyfests have been staged across the globeâ€”this year alone, there are Ladyfests slated for Germany, South Africa and Australia. Megan Smith, one of the creators of CU-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radio1190.org/" title="Radio 1190">Radio 1190</a>â€™s <i>Testosterone Detox</i> show, organized the first LadyFest Out West in 2003.  Now sheâ€™s back with plenty of help and has put together a packed schedule for the three-day festival.<br />
<br />
The varied lineup includes spoken word performances by Andrea Gibson, who won Denverâ€™s slam poetry competition for three years running and led the cityâ€™s team to the National Poetry Slam, and Isis, who leads the open mic night at CafÃ© Nuba and recently served as a Denver opening act for the national Def Poetry Jam tour.  There will be plenty of music kicking off each night at the Hi-Dive at 7 p.m. with appearances by Washington D.C.â€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.retarddisco.com/?artist=pl&PHPSESSID=c0bd32db8c7605ef5ebd89800591d15e" title="Partyline">Partyline</a>, the new project of Allison Wolfe (who used to be in key Riot Grrrl band Bratmobile), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/kkofibru/sarah.html" title="Sarah Dougher">Sarah Dougher</a>, a Portland-based singer-songwriter who holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and Tricrotic, a Chicago band fronted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nomylamm.com/" title="Nomy Lamm">Nomy Lamm</a>, an activist on many fronts who has founded a â€œphat campâ€? to combat discrimination against the overweight. Local ladies are also getting into the action with scheduled appearances by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supplyboy.com" title="Supply Boy">Supply Boy</a> (August 6) and an old favorite, The Pindowns, a Denver group thatâ€™s reuniting for a one-off show (August 7). <br />
<br />
Ladyfest is steeped in the D.I.Y. (Do-It-Yourself) aesthetic, and to that end several how-to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ladyfestoutwest.org/workshops.html" title="workshops">workshops</a> are planned, including â€œBike Tough: Bike Maintenance Workshopâ€? by the Derailer Bike Collective, the â€œPolyamory 101 Workshop,â€? which will teach â€œhow to make non-monogamy workâ€? and the sure-to-be-popular â€œVibrator Workshop,â€? in which participants will â€œlearn how to turn an easter egg into a rocking little bullet style vibrator.â€?  In addition to workshops and performances, there will be screenings of short films by women filmmakers and an exhibit of womenâ€™s art at The Pod Gallery.  <br />
<br />
And although testosterone should be in short supply throughout the weekend, organizers are careful to point out that men are welcome.

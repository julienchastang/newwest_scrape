							The Wyoming Center For The Book recently launched a website that is extremely progressive by the standards of state literary organizations: <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/" title="The Wyoming Authors Wiki.">The Wyoming Authors Wiki.</a>  While other states' arts web pages can be difficult to navigate or bereft of much useful information (ahem, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloarts.state.co.us/" title="Colorado Council on the Arts">Colorado Council on the Arts</a>), the Wyoming Authors Wiki is shaping up to be a valuable resource for all who are interested in Wyoming literature and writers.  <br />
<br />
Many states' arts organizations are perpetually financially strapped, but the beauty of a wiki is that unpaid contributors provide the content, so once it's set up, there's no need for much funding to keep it going.  Anyone who is interested can register for a wiki identity and begin adding information to the website about authors ranging from well-known contemporary figures such as <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Lynne%20Cheney" title="Lynne">Lynne</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Dick%20Cheney" title="Dick Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Annie%20Proulx" title="Annie Proulx">Annie Proulx</a> to lesser-known past authors such as <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Emma%20Adair" title="Emma Adair">Emma Adair</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Minerva%20Kohlhepp%20Teichert" title="Minerva Kohlhepp Teichert.">Minerva Kohlhepp Teichert.</a><br />
<br />
Any author, past or present, who has published at least one book, lives in Wyoming, lived in Wyoming "at any point," or writes "books specifically about Wyoming" is eligible for inclusion.  Users can search the website by author, genre, or the county that the author is from or writes about.  What better way for a resident of <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingauthors.pbwiki.com/Sweetwater%20County" title="Sweetwater County">Sweetwater County</a>, say, to find out if anything has been written about his hometown?  Each author's page has space to include biographical information, contact information, a list of publications, and details about speaking engagements. The wiki also contains information about new books, book events, writing groups, and Wyoming libraries<br />
<br />
The Wyoming Authors Wiki of course suffers from the drawbacks of all wikis, namely that the information can be inaccurate, and disgruntled types can sabotage entries, but it's difficult to imagine that many would want to target such a website for foul play.  And much more important than the slight potential for problems is the fact that the Wyoming Center for the Book seems to be one of the few literary organizations that is making use of new technologies to promote books and authors, rather than wasting time lamenting how the advent of these technologies have undermined reading as a pastime.<br />

The show features Rinella hunting, chatting with hunting buddies, and expounding on his philosophy of only eating the meat of animals that he has killed himself.&nbsp; You can also catch various Rinella tidbits on his <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/stevenrinella " title="Twitter feed">Twitter feed</a>.

		<p>Rinella's a cool guy and "American Buffalo" was a great book. Happy to hear about his continued success.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 1-19-11</b>
		<p>At first glance, The Wild Within seems to be just another "reality" show. Copycat cable television long ago went off the tracks and lost any sense of genuine creativity and originality. However, Rinella manages to overcome the limits of the genre and reach for some special moments. I have come to love this show and would recommend it to anyone interested in an important and challenging worldview.<br />
By the way, I agree that American Buffalo is a fine book and I would add his first work, The Scavenger's Guide to Haute Cuisine to your reading list. It is excellent and provides a deeper exploration of many of the ideas covered in the television show.</p>

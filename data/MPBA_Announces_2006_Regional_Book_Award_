							This week The <a href="http://www.mountainsplains.org" title="Mountains & Plains Booksellers Association">Mountains & Plains Booksellers Association</a> announced the winners of the <a href="http://www.mountainsplains.org/rbacurrentwinners.html" title="2006 Regional Book Awards">2006 Regional Book Awards</a>.  According to its website, the MPBA "represents 250+ independent, locally-owned bookstores throughout the greater Rocky Mountain region." The group accepts nominations for its awards from independent booksellers, then turns the finalists over to judging panels.  One of the criteria for judging is that the books must be set primarily in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, Idaho, Texas, Montana, Kansas, Arizona, Nebraska, or South Dakota, so these awards serve as an excellent way to highlight regional literature.  And the winners are: <br />
<br />
<b>Adult Fiction:</b> <i>A Sudden Country</i> by <a href="http://www.bookpage.com/0508bp/fiction/sudden_country.html" title="Karen Fisher">Karen Fisher</a>, Random House<br />
<br />
<b>Adult Nonfiction:</b> <i>109 East Palace: Robert Oppenheimer and the Secret City of Los Alamos</i> by <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?sid=287&pid=362117" title="Jennet Conant">Jennet Conant</a>, Simon & Schuster<br />
<br />
<b>The Arts:</b> <i>William Henry Jackson’s "The Pioneer Photographer"</i> by William Henry Jackson, Howard R. Driggs (Collaborator), Bob Blair (Editor), <a href="http://www.museumofnewmexico.org" title="Museum of New Mexico Press">Museum of New Mexico Press</a><br />
<br />
<b>Young Adult:</b> <i>Bear Dancer: The Story of a Ute Girl</i> by <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/destination.cfm?sid=33&pid=504597" title="Thelma Hatch Wyss">Thelma Hatch Wyss</a>, Margaret K. McElderry Books <br />
<br />
The MPBA also presents a Spirit of the West Award, a career achievement honor which will go to the accomplished historian Robert M. Utley this year.<br />
<br />
All the winners will be on hand to read from their work and sign books at the annual banquet, which this year will be held at the Marriott Denver Tech Center (tickets are $35).<br />
<br />
I served as one of the judges for the nonfiction categories in 2002; we chose Judy Blunt's riveting memoir <i>Breaking Clean</i> as the Adult Nonfiction winner and the wonderfully illustrated and insightful <i>Drawn To Yellowstone: Artists in America's First National Park</i> by Peter H. Hassrick as the winner in The Arts.  My delight at receiving a huge box full fourteen wonderful books was only slightly diminished by the fact that I had to read them all within a little over a month.  I spent a lot of time on my couch during that period, dutifully reading all of the books cover to cover, and then we judges debated over which books to award the prizes.<br />
<br />
As for this year's books, I haven't read any of them yet, but they look like a fascinating bunch.  Karen Fisher's <i>A Sudden Country</i> is based on the 1847 Utah migration, and <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA603913.html?text=%22a+sudden+country%22" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher's Weekly</a> gave it a rave: "Fisher builds a grand, mesmerizing novel on the bare chronicle left by her ancestor Emma Ruth Ross Slavin, who was 11 when her family joined the 1847 Oregon migration." Publisher's Weekly describes Jennet Conant's <i>109 East Palace: Robert Oppenheimer and the Secret City of Los Alamos</i> as "a human look at the brilliant physicists who for more than two years, along with their families, lived, laughed, despaired and rejoiced in a secret, sequestered, for some claustrophobic city in the New Mexico desert." According to the MPBA, <i>William Henry Jackson’s "The Pioneer Photographer"</i> "collects 136 black-and-white and 24 color images and reconciles Jackson’s recollections with ancillary information about the Ferdinand Hayden geological surveys of the 1870s." Booklist describes <i>Bear Dancer: The Story of a Ute Girl</i> as "The first historical novel from seasoned author Wyss (<i>Here at the Scenic-Vu Hotel</i>, 1988, and others), based on true events, presents the drama of the American West in approachable terms for middle-grade readers. Elk Girl is a Tabaguache Ute who is seized by a raiding tribe then traded to another, an experience that leaves her "with no heart left for caring, just an empty place inside her."<br />

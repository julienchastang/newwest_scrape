							In the midst of a career renaissance, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.otistaylor.com/" title="Otis Taylor">Otis Taylor</a> is single-handedly putting Colorado on the contemporary blues map.  Beginning with 1998â€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.otistaylor.com/negroes.swf" title="When Negroes Walked The Earth">When Negroes Walked The Earth</a>, Taylor has recorded six albums in eight years, each of them a nuanced, thought-provoking piece of art. Contemporary blues is marred by too many musicians playing unimaginative rehashes of the same three chord blues template, but Taylor has distinguished himself as an iconoclast, reinvigorating the blues into a form that can endure and thrive in the current century. His peers have recognized the important role his music plays in the future of the blues, nominating him for several W.C. Handy Awards (the top blues honor), including the one he won for Best New Artist in 2002. Taylor wasnâ€™t exactly new to the game, howeverâ€”heâ€™d enjoyed a successful career as a sideman in the â€˜60s and â€˜70s before temporarily retiring from music in 1977 to become an antiques dealer and the coach of a professional bicycle team.<br />
<br />
Born in Chicago in 1948, Taylor and his family moved to Denver after the murder of his uncle (a disturbing event that he explores in 2001â€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.otistaylor.com/white.swf" title="White African">White African</a>). Indeed, itâ€™s Taylorâ€™s reliance on harrowing family stories like this one for material that renders his music so raw and gripping. Taylorâ€™s new CD, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telarc.com/gscripts/title.asp?gsku=3627&mscssid=K2GAP2HR3N2A8HU8XVUGBD7J48HN2F3B" title="Below The Fold">Below The Fold</a>, delves even deeper into his family history, and his personal stories once again paint the larger picture of the history of African Americans in generalâ€”from Taylorâ€™s fatherâ€™s job as a porter with the Pullman Company (an employer that played an important role in helping blacks across the country gain a foothold in the middleclass), to the dispiriting experience of black soldiers in World War II (â€œGovernment Liedâ€?), to the South of the civil rights era (â€œBelow The Foldâ€?). In Taylorâ€™s music, the politics are always personal.<br />
<br />
The music itself on <i>Below The Fold</i> is even freer from convention than Taylorâ€™s last five innovative albums, so much so that it can hardly be classified as blues or as belonging to any other single genre. <i>Below The Fold</i> sounds like an impressionistic journey through the cataclyms of the psyche. The sonic mix includes traditional fiddle and mandolin playing that evokes the era of the Buffalo soldiers pictured on the back of the album, the sounds of an organ, whose swelling strains recall the instrumentâ€™s vital position in the history of gospel music, smoldering Ron Miles trumpets melodies that lend a jazzy flourish to several songs, and electric guitar riffs that reference contemporary Chicago blues. Taylorâ€™s singing is wholly intuitive; his rich, resonant voice drops in and out, refusing to obey the standard verse-chorus-verse mold.  At times he whispers, at times he rages, but heâ€™s never less than riveting.<br />

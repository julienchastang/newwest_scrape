Jennifer Brice&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colgate.edu/DesktopDefault1.aspx?tabid=684&amp;pgID=3400&amp;vID=3&amp;dID=0&amp;fID=43009" title="information page">information page</a> on the website of Colgate University (where she is an Associate Professor of English) lists among her interests: &#8220;Death in Alaska.&#8221;  Clearly there&#8217;s a story there.&nbsp; After reading her new memoir, <a target="_blank" href="http://unp.unl.edu/bookinfo/5214.html" title="Unlearning to Fly">Unlearning to Fly</a>, the Fairbanks-raised Brice&#8217;s fascination with this morbid topic doesn&#8217;t seem at all unusual, as it clearly springs from her frequent brushes with death as a pilot, kayaker, and truck driver, as well as a stint as an obituary writer for a small newspaper.&nbsp; Close scrapes run in the family, with her parents and siblings narrowly escaping with their lives from airplane, truck, and bulldozer accidents, an earthquake, an explosion, and a grizzly bear encounter.
</p>
<p>
Brice wasn&#8217;t always a death-defying &#8220;Grease Monkey,&#8221; as the title of one of her chapters describes her.&nbsp; She writes:&nbsp; 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On school nights, my mother did up my hair in pink foam rollers and Dippity-Do.&nbsp; French lessons, ballet lessons, sewing lessons, violin lessons, and piano lessons turned me into the prissiest thing you ever saw.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even <I>own</I> a pair of blue jeans until I was in high school.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Brice doesn&#8217;t lay out her transition from prissy schoolgirl to competent, accomplished, if self-doubting woman in a linear way.&nbsp; &#8220;Unlearning to Fly&#8221; is structured in a series of essays on different topics that have shaped her life, such as how her Alaskan father romanced her cultured, Massachusetts-raised mother into marriage with a Tiffany diamond ring, her memories of when oil money came flooding into Alaska in the &#8216;70s, and an account of a dynamic doctor friend who died in a plane crash.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
There is a refreshing humility implicit in the way Brice has constructed her memoir; it&#8217;s a structure that acknowledges the overall sweep of her life is not unusual (an education, various jobs, a marriage, three children, a divorce), but that its particulars are distinctive enough to be of interest to others.&nbsp; And the particulars of Brice&#8217;s life are riveting.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
One of the most powerful essays, &#8220;Lullaby for Lloyd,&#8221; is about the I&#241;upiaq boy who Brice&#8217;s parents adopted after having four children of their own.&nbsp; Lloyd, who changed his name to Ben upon adoption, suffers from Fetal Alcohol Effect, a slightly milder disorder than Fetal Alcohol Syndrome that nevertheless turned him into a terror.&nbsp; He acted out constantly, started fires, was drummed out of many schools, and ultimately proved unable to care for himself as an adult.&nbsp; Brice writes with candor about her ambivalence toward her brother:
</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Ben&#8217;s adoption was a leap into the wider world: a leap of faith, a leap of generosity, a leap--some would say--of insanity.&nbsp; Do we regret it?&nbsp; The question used to interest me, but not anymore.&nbsp; Regret is beside the point.&nbsp; For better or worse, Ben showed us, and still shows us, what we&#8217;re made of.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
In several chapters, Brice writes about the skills she&#8217;s acquired as a driver, pilot, and outdoorswoman.&nbsp; Winningly, her accounts of her adventures lack any bravado, and in fact reveal her terror and self-doubt in such detail that the reader wonders why she flies planes at all.&nbsp; Brice doesn&#8217;t perform a thorough examination of her own psyche, which is actually a strength of <I>Unlearning to Fly</I>, a book mainly concerned with the specifics of how to do things: how she drove, loaded, and unloaded a DJB (a type of &#8220;off-road dump truck&#8221; that Brice operated for her father&#8217;s company), how she learned to fly an Arctic Tern, how she gave birth.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Although she doesn&#8217;t write this explicitly, it seems that Brice learned to fly planes and drive trucks in part to become closer to her father, a man who started and still helps run a profitable civil-construction company (Brice Incorporated), and who was frequently away on business for long stretches at a time during her childhood.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
L.A. Brice is not a man prone to introspection, but his daughter&#8217;s mastery of many of the skills he uses in his work seems to have opened an avenue for discussions, and has enhanced the ongoing intimacy between them throughout her adulthood.&nbsp; They are so close, at times they are conspiratorial.&nbsp; At one point, after Brice tells her father that she just survived a near mid-air collision caused by another pilot, he says, &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of any reason why your mother has to hear about this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Brice&#8217;s approach in <I>Unlearning to Fly</I> pairs reticence with honesty--she mentions her marriage, divorce, and struggles as a single mother of three only in passing, but readily admits that she&#8217;s less than gorgeous, describing herself as &#8220;the kind of woman who looks good to men who&#8217;ve been at sea a long time.&#8221;  Because Brice hasn&#8217;t bared all, the reader finishes <I>Unlearning to Fly</I> eager to hear more of her stories.&nbsp; And in a life as eventful as Jennifer Brice&#8217;s, there&#8217;s sure to be more to tell.

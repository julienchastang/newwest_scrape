							This morning Aurora Police curtailed their search for a missing six-year-old girl, Aaron√© Thompson, telling the <a target="_blank" href="ttp://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4246696,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> that they have ‚Äúexhausted locations around the home.‚Ä? The police have used volunteers, bloodhounds, motorcycles, and even  an airplane to look for the girl, who has been missing since Monday.  Last night, the story led local news broadcasts, with footage of police going door-to-door, questioning neighbors, and conducting grim searches of trash bins, fields, a golf course, creeks, and ponds. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/video/5342922/index.html" title="7 News">7 News</a> even tracked down Aaron√©‚Äôs mother, Lynette Thompson, who is living in a shelter in Detroit and cannot afford to make the trip to Denver to help with the search.  <br />
<br />
The story of this missing girl is no less sad for it being a common one, but what struck me as I watched the news coverage was the contrast between the exhaustive array of resources and human attention that Aaron√© is now receiving, and the utter lack of community attention she likely received before she went missing.  It makes me angry that some media outlets seem to pay so little attention to children growing up in poverty until something awful happens to them, when they can then use them to fuel sensationalistic news coverage.<br />
<br />
<i>Update: This story took a sickening twist late Thursday, when Aurora police said they now believe that Aaron√© was killed up to a year ago.  Her father and his live-in girlfriend are "persons of interest," and the other children have been removed from the house.</i>

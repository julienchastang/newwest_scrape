	In Boise novelist Mitch Wieland&#8217;s <I>God&#8217;s Dogs</I>, Ferrell Swan, a sixty-year-old retired Ohio schoolteacher sets out to live alone in a cabin in the Idaho desert for many of the same reasons hermits have been taking to remote outposts for centuries: he seeks solitude, time to reflect in the wilderness, a chance to engage in the physical labor, and above all a break from his interpersonal failures.&nbsp; In heading to Idaho, Ferrell left behind three ex-wives, an angry stepson, and the many social obligations that come with teaching high school in the same community for decades.&nbsp; But the poor guy doesn&#8217;t get much of a break: on the first page of <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Gods-Dogs-Stories-Mitch-Wieland/dp/0870745530" title="God's Dogs">God&#8217;s Dogs</a></I>, that ne&#8217;er-do-well stepson, Levon, shows up on Ferrell&#8217;s doorstep, needing to heal in the wake of a bar fight.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The two haven&#8217;t spoken for three years, but the men and Levon&#8217;s mother, Rilla, will talk a lot over the course of the book, hashing out what went wrong between them.&nbsp; Ferrell allows Levon to stay, but he&#8217;s not exactly happy about it.&nbsp; &#8220;Somewhere along the way he&#8217;s become a back-to-nature guy or a passive survivalist&#8212;he&#8217;s not sure which,&#8221; Wieland writes, &#8220;All he knows is he wanted to be left be after the divorce, and if being left alone meant doing for yourself, then so be it.&nbsp; He grew up working his grandfather&#8217;s farm in northeast Ohio&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t like he was some fed-up lawyer or business suit quitting his hundred thousand per to move to Idaho or Montana and talk to God.&nbsp; In his eyes he was simply returning to his roots for lack of any other damn thing to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>God&#8217;s Dogs</I> is a &#8220;novel in stories,&#8221; and each chapter stands alone as a focused story, written in sharp prose with the pleasing density of language that good short stories have.&nbsp; All the chapters were published previously in literary magazines, and one chapter, &#8220;The Bones of Hagerman,&#8221; was included in the <I>Best of the West 2009</I> anthology.&nbsp; But readers probably wouldn&#8217;t notice that the book is divided into stories if it weren&#8217;t for that subtitle.&nbsp; The structure is smooth, proceeding chronologically, with variable gaps in time between where one story leaves off and the next picks up, but always fixing on a critical episode in the evolving relationships between Ferrell, Levon, and Rilla, a triangle that builds to its unsettling climax before the end of the book.
</p>
<p>
Wieland works with elemental themes, the desert isolation of Ferrell&#8217;s cabin in some ways serving as a stage set to show what goes on between one man and one woman when all other distractions are taken away.&nbsp; The ravishing Rilla shows up and Levon disappears again, leaving Ferrell and Rilla to make love, take long&#8212;often naked&#8212;walks in the desert, and discuss their lives.&nbsp; They observe and howl with coyotes that take on symbolic resonance throughout the book, and Ferrell is reluctant to shoot the coyotes even when they start to destroy his lambs.&nbsp; They witness a herd of mustangs that so captures Rilla&#8217;s imagination that she determines to buy one at a BLM auction.&nbsp; But Levon didn&#8217;t disappear without stirring up trouble, as usual.&nbsp; Before taking off, Levon had a fling with Ferrell&#8217;s neighbor Cole&#8217;s much younger wife, leaving her pregnant.&nbsp; The repercussions of this sustain the plot&#8217;s momentum for the rest of the book.
</p>
<p>
As the story plays out, Ferrell realizes that in some ways he&#8217;s inherited his father&#8217;s tendency to abandon those who love him, and that he has come closer to realizing his father&#8217;s Western dream than he ever did.&nbsp; &#8220;His father was a flesh-and-blood contradiction, and despite his denial of the farmer&#8217;s life, he dreamed daily of the West, of cowboys riding beneath the high hot sun.&nbsp; At the time, it was beyond Ferrell how the man could transform a cattle drive into something other than days of heatstroke and an aching ass.&#8221;  One day when Ferrell was a teenager,  his father began to wear a Stetson and cowboy boots around their Ohio town.&nbsp; He moved to the basement, then left Ferrell and his mother, heading West, but making it no further toward realizing his Western dreams than Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
As Ferrell, the would-be hermit learns in the accomplished <I>God&#8217;s Dogs</I>, dreams can be difficult to realize, and even their realization can leave one feeling hollow.

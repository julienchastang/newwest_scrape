		<h1>Literary Gender Imbalance Uncovered by VIDA is Reflected in Western Lit</h1>
		<h2><i>Why I'm afraid to read books with horses on the cover.</i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 2-16-11</p>
			
			
							<p>For some time I&#8217;ve noticed that the majority of the books submitted to me for review are written by men, a ratio I&#8217;d estimate at five books by men for every one book by a woman. I noticed this discrepancy particularly among the big six publishers&#8212;very few of the books set in the West produced by major publishers are written by women. I am more likely to find books written by women from small and academic presses. I wondered if this male dominance was just a Western thing.
</p>
<p>
As I read and enjoyed books regardless of the gender of their authors, I also noticed a disturbing trend, a formula that Western books by major publishers included again and again: a depiction of horses plus violence against women in books written by men. Usually these authors are compared to Cormac McCarthy, either in the blurbs or the jacket copy. I realize it weakens my argument not to mention these books by name, but I don&#8217;t want to single out anybody, because I think each writer chose to use these elements for personal, artistic reasons, and I don&#8217;t blame any of them for it. But I just may have been a wee bit crankier in my reviews of these books.
</p>
<p>
I began to dread reading books with horses on the cover. Sure, on the outside, it&#8217;s all the pretty horses, but on the inside it&#8217;s going to be all the beaten, cowering women.
</p>
<p>
Was I being paranoid? I discussed this gender imbalance a little with my friends but I didn&#8217;t write anything about it here because I didn&#8217;t have any concrete statistics to back it up. But now I do: VIDA, an organization that supports &#8220;women in the literary arts&#8221; counted the number of male and female book reviewers, and the number of books written by male and female authors reviewed at the most prestigious magazines, including the New York Times Book Review, the Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker, and the New Republic and found that male writers were favored at most places by a ratio of three or four to one. (<a target="_blank" href="http://vidaweb.org/the-count-2010" title="The complete data are here">The complete data are here</a>.) 
</p>
<p>
Ruth Franklin of The New Republic <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/82930/VIDA-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews" title="decided to run her own count">decided to run her own count</a>. She wondered if more books by men were being reviewed because more books by men were being published. Voila&#8212;it turned out that was true. She analyzed the fall 2010 catalogs of 13 big and small publishers, and only one, Riverhead, had anything close to an even ratio. The second most even was Random House, with 37 percent of the books they published by women. It went down hill from there, with women accounting for just twenty percent or so of the books produced by most publishers.
</p>
<p>
So it&#8217;s clear there is a pervasive gender imbalance in books that are published and reviewed. Although I look for the best book to highlight on New West, regardless of whether the writer is male or female, I&#8217;ve always tried to review as many books by women as I can. And given the results of these studies, I&#8217;m going to try harder to bring to light more books about the West written by women&#8212;they are out there if you look hard enough. Last week, I reviewed an overlooked gem, Ruth McLaughlin&#8217;s memoir <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/ruth_mclaughlins_bound_like_grass_a_montana_farm_memoir/C39/L39/" title="Bound Like Grass">Bound Like Grass</a></I>, published a few months ago by the University of Oklahoma Press.

&#8226; Speaking of excellent Western woman writers, Joanne Ostrow wrote a long profile of the journalist and author <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_helen_thorpe/C39/L39/" title="Helen Thorpe">Helen Thorpe</a> for the Denver Post last week called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_17343390?source=commented-entertainment" title=""The accidental first lady."">&#8220;The accidental first lady.&#8221;</a> As the title suggests, the article is about Thorpe&#8217;s reluctance to assume a traditional first lady role as her husband, John Hickenlooper, recently became the governor of Colorado. Ostrow reports that Thorpe finished an update for the paperback edition of <I>Just Like Us</I>, one of my favorite books from a couple years ago. Ostrow also writes:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Next, a stage adaptation [of &#8216;Just Like Us&#8217;] has been commissioned by the Denver Center Theatre Company. Thorpe will serve as adviser to playwright Karen Zacarias (who adapted the novel &#8216;How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents&#8217;). Denver Center artistic director Kent Thompson believes this play could be the next &#8216;Plainsong&#8217; or &#8216;Eventide,&#8217; previous adaptations that became DCTC signature pieces, and, with its focus on immigration, &#8216;may have more resonance even than those did.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Last month, the Post shrunk its Sunday books section from four pages to two, which typically include one or two reviews written for the Denver Post. The rest of the space is now filled with wire stories, mostly from the Washington Post.

		<p>Maybe the strong,  silent types in the West have been women.  Hard at whatever they are doing at the moment,  and thinking about what has to be done down the road,  never time to write it all down.  I read Range magazine,  which has a woman publisher,  and there seems to be a lot of women featured in stories, and writing stories.  That magazine is a land use and ethic directed undertaking,  and passionate women are part of the landscape under fire from urban protectionism.  Women write there in defense of their livelihoods,  their families.  You have the she bear aspect of advocacy writing.  No fiction,  ma'm.  Just the facts.  <br />
<br />
The West is the most urbanized landscape in the USA.  The overwhelming majority lives in town or the big city.  If there is a dearth of literature from women in the West,  and a surfeit of writing by males,  it is an urban problem.  Form some committees.  Sit a commission.  Solve the problem.  <br />
<br />
In the rural landscape,  keeping the written word in journals,  diaries,  self published books,  is a very womanly thing to do and has been for a long time.  I have only to think of Sarah Winnemucca,  who turned sixteen as a non-English speaking illiterate,  and not more than a decade later she was fully versed in the language,  competent enough to have written expansive letters to Presidents and Congress,  gone on extensive speaking tours  and had written a book on her Piute people's plight.  From the stone age to running a school,  a world of accomplishments,  and dead from TB in her early forties.  <br />
<br />
If there appear to be and are,  too many books by males in relation to their percentage of the population,  you do have to look at who majors in what at University,  and if there has been a female track in the earth and life sciences,  technology, as workplace equality open doors and fast tracks to success.  I remember the GI Bill students in the "ologies" and engineering,  forestry,  business management in my youth.  A world war,  the Korean conflict,  and Vietnam had a plethora of young men coming out of school at the same time as the Federal and State governments were larding their research and "ologist" rolls to address an ever increasing load of science based boxes to check off before government money could be spent on a project.  Those soldiers had civil service preference points to add on their test scores,  and they got the jobs over men who did not serve and women who almost never served except in skilled positions.  And I remember all the  men losing those jobs well into their working life as lawsuits forced men from the prospective hiring rolls in preference for women and men of color.  How many became writers?  And how many prospective female writers became foresters and engineers,  firemen and police officers because they had a college degree.  And to the Feds,  a degree was all that was needed, and it did not have to be in the field you were going to work in.  Social engineering:  did that put a lid on the pot,  on  the corps of female writers?  And now we have the late in life mommy track.  My wife is with an aging daughter at the egg planter's as I write,  hoping to get a motile sperm to stick.  A rural ranch wife can relate to the trials of AI.  But they are such a minority in the New West,  the very urban New West.  <br />
<br />
I haven't been around the University for a long time.  I do wonder what jobs are being sought today's students by gender and by sexual preference within gender,  and by race and ethnicity.    Are there many female writing prospects?  Or is the woman who would have become a writer at one time now in law school?  Working on an MBA.  And you know that two out of three University graduates today are female.  60%.  And you do wonder who the English majors are.  The writers to be,  writers in waiting,  the writer wannabe's.  Are they equal in number?  Just statistics would make  you think that there might be a three to two selection for female writers in another decade as skills are honed,  and life is experienced.  Maybe it is too early to wonder why there are no more female writers being published.  Might there be an aging process,  like in fine wines,  a sharp cheese?  Great furniture.  Fine writers.  Only time will tell.</p>

		<p>Judy Blunt's "Breaking Clean" has a horse on the cover and it ain't an easy read unless you're willing to ignore page after page after page after page after page of detailed factoids about the lives of cattle. Blunt writes about people, too, but often relationships between people are overshadowed by relationships between people and their cattle. People who care about cattle tend to be ranchers who have a financial stake in the well-being of their cattle. So they might as well have well been discussing corn, soybeans or other crops that make money for ranchers and farmers. I'd didn't give a rat's butt about cattle before I read Breaking Clean. Now I never want to read about cattle again. Nor do I want to read an ode to the soybean. Blunt is a fine writer, but it doesn't matter when the main topic is cattle. Reckon I'll avoid all books with a horse on the cover whether the author is male or female.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By James Work, 2-17-11</b>
		<p>Jenny, I know exactly what you're talking about. This topic has opened many a can of wrigglers at WLA--and starting in the 60s it expanded into the question of women authors of Chicana, Native American and Asian-American books.<br />
<br />
Let me tell a cautionary story. Back at the start of my career I noticed that the famed prototypical gunfight in Wister's THE VIRGINIAN (1902) is a very tame, non-violent affair. No blood, no cussing, no dying men kicking dust, nothing. At the same time I was studying John Cunningham's THE TIN STAR (1947) where the gunfight goes on for pages and involves gut-shooting, puking in the dirt, bullets slamming into soft flesh--all very graphic. I was also cataloguing CSU's collection of pulp western paperbacks and noticed that almost every book had a gun in the cover picture.<br />
<br />
So I took a running leap at a conclusion: violence in westerns started out pretty tame and became more and more violent through the years!! Aha!!  I wrote a paper about it. Thank heaven I sent it to Max Westbrook, who sent me a long list of westerns written in the 1903-1916 period that were full of violence. Including Emerson Hough's earlier westerns. So, jumping to conclusions might be good exercise until some sharpshooter picks you off in the air.<br />
<br />
I guess it shows that our literature is complex and wonderfully full of variety. And maybe that cover illustrations sell books! I'd bet that a visit to the used book store would suggest that for every two horse covers you'd find one with a woman in a low-cut dress or skintight buckskins.  Maybe I'll go look . . . .<br />

		<b>Comment By Tom Miller, 2-17-11</b>
		<p>The VIDA stats may be accurate, but they’re meaningless unless they're compared with the previous three-to-five years. Is there a pattern over time? Is there a detectable trend? The VIDA numbers, depressing as they may be, may be trending upward and actually show improvement over previous years. (Although, true -- when Becky Sinkler was editor of the NYTimes Book Review, that publication’s numbers were closer to 50-50 for reviewers and the reviewed.) <br />
<br />
When I edited an anthology of literature about the U.S.-Mexico border ("Writing on the Edge: A Borderlands Reader," Univ. of Arizona Press), I ended up with eighteen women and eighty men. This, after combing private bookshelves and public libraries on both sides of the frontier for fiction and non-fiction going back a century and more. And 80-20 was about the equation of material available. I’m not one to insist on literary quotas – I don’t think the reproductive organs one is born with determines one’s ability to write – but the obvious factors invariably came into play: access to typewriters and publishers, role in society, and cultural expectations. <br />
<br />
Most of the women excerpted in the border anthology had been published within the last twenty-five years. (It’s a bit of a stretch to include Maya Angelou in that list, as her autobiography "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" came out in 1969, but still – her recollection of crossing into Tijuana as a wide-eyed and innocent teen-ager remains memorable to this day.) It all comes down to the obvious – good writing is good writing and bad writing is bad writing, regardless of your chromosomes, whether your last name ends in a vowel or a z, or whether you’re published by Bertelsmann or Cinco Puntos Press. Punto.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patia, 2-18-11</b>
		<p>Very interesting stats and observations. Thanks, Jenny. I do wonder whether women are writing less or getting published less. Women tend to be busier caring for families; we also tend to self-censor and struggle with confidence more. <br />
<br />
Dave: If you think "Breaking Clean" was about cattle, you weren't paying attention.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Chérie Newman, 2-18-11</b>
		<p>I, too, struggle to maintain gender balance for my weekly literary program, The Write Question. Where are the novels written by women? I keep asking.<br />
<br />
Women who used to write fiction, I've noticed, have migrated to nonfiction, especially memoir (at least in the West, which is the focus of my program). And I've heard (from them) that they endured years of rejection letters before switching.<br />
<br />
So, imagine my glee when I received a copy of THE RINGER!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By bearbait, 2-18-11</b>
		<p>Molly Ivins and Larry McMurtry both wrote about the same Texas experience.  McMurtry produced novel after novel covering the same subjects,  the same Texans,  the same landscape that Ivins did.  Only she produced columns for the Fort Worth Star,  all biting,  tough,  hard nosed satire critical of the foibles of the Texas big ego and easy going corruption.  The bigger than life portrayals were common to McMurtry and Ivins.  But the outputs were of differing volume,  and pointed at different audiences.  Both were commercial successes.  I would have to leave it to the literary critics for any assessment of competence and style,  social contributions.  <br />
<br />
Ivins is and has been considered a one of a kind writer for her gender,  and compared to Mark Twain.  If there is a unique Texas political commentator,  journalist of the uniqueness of that State,  coming down the road,  I have yet to read her.  But would willingly if one is suggested.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 2-21-11</b>
		<p>Thanks everybody for your thoughtful comments.  Your ideas gave me a few thoughts:<br />
<br />
-I agree with Chérie that it seems like more western memoirs by women are published than fiction by women. Memoir seems like a genre that it's easier for women to break into print through, for some reason.  I'm thinking of Jana Richman, for example, a Utah writer who published a memoir first, and only then was she able to get a novel published. (I may be mistaken, but I think she'd tried to get novels published before her memoir.)  Also there's Kim Barnes, who broke in through memoirs and then published fiction. Mary Clearman Blew followed the same pattern.<br />
<br />
-I don't think that fewer women than men are writing; I just think fewer women are getting published, for whatever reason. (Personally I know a lot of great Western women writers who haven't been able to get publishing deals yet--hopefully they'll manage it soon.) Maybe women don't keep trying after lots of rejections?  Or maybe publishers have a preference for the sorts of stories that men write?  I don't know, but in western fiction at least, the gender preference is clear.<br />
<br />
-I agree with Tom that if you're editing an anthology or a web page like me, you should judge the writing just on its quality, not on the demographics of the writer, but that said, I've found that I can find high quality writing by women to feature if I just look harder--the majority of the western books published by major presses and given a lot of hype are by men--the books you'd be bound to hear about anyway--but if I dig through the catalogs of the presses at the Universities of Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and New Mexico, for example, I can find quality books by women.<br />
<br />
-Last, I've just got to defend Judy Blunt's wonderful Breaking Clean! I was on the committee that awarded it the Mountains & Plains Booksellers Association prize, and it was about way more than just cows!  But of course you are entitled to your opinion about it Dave, as we all are.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, everybody, for your comments!</p>

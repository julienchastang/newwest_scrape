<p>
	Missoula writer David Allan Cates&#8217; third novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Freeman-Walker-David-Allan-Cates/dp/1932961550/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224184095&amp;sr=8-1" title="Freeman Walker">Freeman Walker</a></I>, covers vast tracts of land as it follows the title character, born Jimmy Gates, from his origins as the beloved son of an enslaved woman and her master in Maryland to his education at a boarding school in England, his time spent as a worker in a squalid saddle factory in London, his subsequent return to America to seek his mother, his involvement in the Civil War as a soldier for the North and then as a captive grave digger for the South, his trip West to try his hand in the gold mines, and his adventures as the secretary for the Governor of the Great Western Territory.&nbsp; Cates blends realism with fantastical elements in this tale of one man&#8217;s quest to make his way in a brutal and complicated world.
</p>
<p>
	<I>Freeman Walker</I> opens in a bucolic setting, with Jimmy growing up in a cabin by the river on Sweet Grass Farm with one green eye from his father and one brown from his mother, with whom he lives.&nbsp; Cates writes, &#8220;When I was a boy I had little interest in freedom, but my father did, so when I was seven years old he freed me, and I was sent across the sea with a change of clothing in a little black maw and a rolled-up copy of the Declaration of Independence that I could not read.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Jimmy&#8217;s father/master wants to see him educated, and to keep his presence as a love child from annoying his wife, so he grants him his freedom and sends him to boarding school in England.&nbsp; After suffering loneliness and displacement in a quarantine room upon his arrival, Jimmy excels at school.&nbsp; Several years later, Jimmy&#8217;s father attempts to visit him and his ship sinks at sea, thus ending his financial support at school, and causing him to be delivered to a saddle maker in a London slum.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
This is when the elements of improbable luck, both good and bad, that will characterize the rest of the book begin to surface.&nbsp; Jimmy&#8217;s boss is fond of him, and allows him to enrich himself by robbing bloated bodies that they fish from the Thames.&nbsp; Although he is basically a decent person, elements of latent cruelty in Jimmy&#8217;s personality arise, such as when he pays for a prostitute and then forcibly drinks all the milk from her breasts despite the woman&#8217;s protests that it&#8217;s intended to feed her baby.&nbsp; Jimmy seizes the opportunity to steal some gold when it arises, and uses the money to return to America when he is 18.
</p>
<p>
America, he discovers, is in the midst of the Civil War.&nbsp; After a short-lived stint as a soldier, during which he manages to save the life of an Irish-American Colonel named Cornelius O&#8217;Keefe, he is captured by the rebel army and is forced to dig graves along with other enslaved black men.&nbsp; Jimmy&#8217;s racial identity shifts throughout the book&#8212;when his hair is long, others identify him as black, and when it&#8217;s short or covered with a hat, he passes for white.&nbsp; Until this point he had been somewhat sheltered from the indignities facing a black man in 19th century America, but now he bears the full brunt of them.&nbsp; After a chilling episode during which Jimmy must make a terrible choice, he ends up free to leave the war-torn South.
</p>
<p>
He heads West to try his hand as a gold prospector, giving himself the name Freeman Walker, and eventually is robbed and maimed, but then is saved when O&#8217;Keefe turns up as the newly appointed Governor of the Great Western Territory.&nbsp; O&#8217;Keefe hires Walker as his secretary, and a Native American man named Belly as his captain.&nbsp; Walker frequently makes and loses fortunes, survives scrapes with certain death, and manages to save his companions, sometimes with the help of ghosts, which leads the Colonel to describe him as &#8220;a faerie.&#8221; Walker accepts this as a term that describes his curious position both in-and-out-of the world.
</p>
<p>
In its mix of whimsy and pathos and its episodic plot that at times plays on elements of the Western genre, <I>Freeman Walker</I> reminded me a bit of Leif Enger&#8217;s <I>Peace Like A River</I>.&nbsp; However, because of this blend of comic and tragic elements, at times the intended tone is difficult to decipher.&nbsp; For example, near the end of the book, the Colonel, Freeman, and Belly set out to put a stop to some lawlessness dressed in outlandish outfits: &#8220;Captain Belly wore his bearskin cape pinned with bright yellow strips of fabric, a blue sleeve, a long green stocking on one leg, and a long purple stocking on the other.&nbsp; On his head was an oversized beaver-fur cap with a tin star on the front.&#8221;  The Colonel wears an &#8220;absurdly large feathered hat&#8221; and &#8220;an amber cloak.&#8221;  Dressed like this, the three men ride out to confront outlaws who are indiscriminately scalping natives for the bounty their hair brings, and some very disturbing and sad occurrences ensue, in between episodes of joshing dialogue.
</p>
<p>
At times I felt off-kilter, unsure how I was supposed to respond to each episode that tried to mix humor with gore.&nbsp; Consequently, I wasn&#8217;t as wrapped up in the fates of the characters as I might have been.&nbsp; I especially enjoy fiction that skillfully blends humor and tragedy (including recent books such as Annie Proulx&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/annie_proulxs_wyoming_is_fine_just_the_way_it_is/C39/L39/" title="Fine Just the Way it is">Fine Just the Way it is</a></I>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_dagoberto_gilb/C39/L39/" title="Dagoberto Gilb">Dagoberto Gilb</a>&#8216;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/dagoberto_gilbs_the_flowers/C39/L39/" title="The Flowers">The Flowers</a></I>, Hannah Tinti&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/oct/03/imaginative-debut-novel-a-perfect-autumn-read/" title="The Good Thief">The Good Thief</a></I>, and Dave Eggers&#8217; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/15/the-genius-and-the-lost-boy/" title="What is the What">What is the What</a></I>), and even though this blend of high and low is characteristic of novels in the picaresque tradition to which <I>Freeman Walker</I> is clearly aspiring, it&#8217;s difficult to do elegantly, and Cates hasn&#8217;t quite pulled it off.
</p>
<p>
Still, for all those who enjoy a sprawling yarn and have an interest in the upheavals occurring in every corner of 19th-century America, <I>Freeman Walker</I> should satisfy.

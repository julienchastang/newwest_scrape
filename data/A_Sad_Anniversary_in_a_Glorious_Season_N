		<h1>A Sad Anniversary in a Glorious Season</h1>

							My first niece was born last night at 11:21 p.m. in Castle Rock, Colorado.  When my sister-in-law went into labor, it looked as though the baby would be born today, on the fifth anniversary of the September 11th attacks, and my mom and I said, "Well, at least it would be a happier association with that date."  But I think we were all glad that the baby scheduled her appearance forty minutes before midnight so that her birthday won't be associated with a day that brings such sadness to so many people.  I looked back in the journal I keep intermittently to see what I was doing and thinking five years ago.  My boyfriend (now husband) and I did what seemed natural to assuage our sadness in the days following the attacks: we headed to the mountains to enjoy the glorious colors of the aspen leaves.<br />
<br />
The weekend after September 11th, 2001, I wrote: "The aspen leaves were radiant, luminescent.  They seemed to provide their own light.  They colored the mountainsides, rivers of gold among the evergreens.  Some of them were red-gold.  We pulled off onto a dirt road to see a magnificent grove of trees with red-gold tops.  When I stood among them and looked up, I couldn't see the red, unless I got off to an angle.  Although the trees looked entirely red from far away, the leaves themselves were just faintly brushed with red at the tips.  The dirt roads were covered with dainty golden leaves.  White bark and yellow leaves: fairytale trees, not to be believed.  <br />
<br />
Under the trees in the golden grove, we saw a carcass picked almost clean, the rib cage of a deer or elk, and a few feet away, a string of vertebrae from the neck.  Meat clinging in stringy wisps, and time had not yet bleached the bones.  The rib cage lay on a bed of yellow aspen leaves, and the leaves continued to fall upon it as I watched. <br />
<br />
Another couple pulled off to see the same grove, a middle-aged husband and wife.  They were excited and serious about the prospect of photographing it, calling to each other urgently when they found a good angle, <i>Bring the camera!</i>  They lay on their bellies to get a shot looking up, then stood and backed off onto a slight rise in the ground to capture the whole view.  <br />
<br />
The sky was brilliant blue and the leaves were yellow and both were full of sun.  The atmosphere was enchanting under the mottled canopy of the aspen leaves.  It made you feel you should have something better to do than stare upwards, gape mouthed, gawking at trees.  Maybe a ritual was required, a lovely song, if you could sing.  But you feel clumsy next to something so lovely and delicate.<br />
<br />
On the way back we saw a herd of bighorn sheep walking across a ledge like it wasn't steep, sure-footed, leaping horizontally across an almost vertical ledge, kicking down dirt and rocks.  At first it looked like it was just a family of sheep, but in the woods behind the roadside ledge the rest of the herd began to trot, and reveled themselves to be perhaps three dozen in number.<br />
<br />
J says the biggest living organism is a grove of aspens in Utah--they're all genetically the same, part of one big organism.  If you carve into the aspen's bark, the mark stays for years.  On that day we only saw a carving as old as 1995, the something family--the name was difficult to read.  Although the carving was fairly recent, those kids could be grown by now.<br />
<br />
People drove around and pulled off on the side of the road, star-struck by the leaves.  We were all wandering around like grinning idiots.  Still, there were American flags everywhere, which kept you thinking about it.  In all the little mountain towns people had their flags out, waving them in front of every business."<br />
<br />
Going to visit the aspens helped me feel better in those dark days following the September 11th attacks, and I can't think of any better cure to the gloomy mood many of us feel on their fifth anniversary than to head into the mountains and admire the golden leaves against the blue sky.<br />

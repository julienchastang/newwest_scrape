							<p>This year&#8217;s Nobel Prize in Literature<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/books/10nobel.html" title=" was awarded to Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl&#233;zio"> was awarded to Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl&#233;zio</a>, a French citizen, or as I prefer to think of him, a guy from Albuquerque.&nbsp; According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2008/bio-bibl.html" title="Nobel Prize website">Nobel Prize website</a>, &#8220;Since the 90s Le Cl&#233;zio and his wife share their time between Albuquerque in New Mexico, the island of Mauritius and Nice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The American literary blogosphere has been abuzz for a couple weeks over the comments that Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, made to reporters from the <a target="_blank" href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_NOBEL_LITERATURE?SITE=MAFAL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>.&nbsp; Engdahl said: &#8220;The U.S. is too isolated, too insular. They don&#8217;t translate enough and don&#8217;t really participate in the big dialogue of literature&#8230;That ignorance is restraining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Since he is the &#8220;top member of the award jury,&#8221; his beliefs would seem to put any American writer out of contention for the Nobel until Engdahl resigns.&nbsp; When Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl&#233;zio was announced as the winner last week, most took it as a sign that Engdahl had made good on his promise to exclude Americans, but the guy lives part time in Albuquerque.&nbsp; How non-American can he be?&nbsp; As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-et-ulin10-2008oct10,0,2703179.story" title="David L. Ulin writes in the L.A. Times">David L. Ulin writes in the L.A. Times</a>:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;Le Clezio does seem intriguing; an &#8220;irregular&#8221; resident of Albuquerque&#8212;he has taught, on and off, at the University of New Mexico&#8212;he is fascinated by the notion of borders, both real and metaphorical, and has written nonfiction about the American Southwest and Mexico.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
I admit that like Ulin, I had not heard of Le Cl&#233;zio, and as a bookish person who also happens to be married to a French guy, I suppose I should be ashamed of that, and take it as a sign of the ignorance in which I&#8217;m currently marinating along with my countrymen.&nbsp; Nah.
</p>
<p>
Besides living part time in Albuquerque, Le Cl&#233;zio has another connection to our region: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/pages/LeClezioNobelPrize.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" title="University of Nebraska Press">University of Nebraska Press</a>, one of my very favorite small presses, published English translations of two of his books.&nbsp; The press specializes in the literature of the American West, baseball, and French stuff, so you can see why I am so fond of it.
</p>
<p>
The three-day <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copper-nickel.org/10/" title="Women Writing the West">Women Writing the West</a> symposium kicks off today in Denver, and it features some great female writers from our region.&nbsp; Poet Maria Melendez and fiction and nonfiction writer Pam Houston read today, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_deirdre_mcnamer/C39/L39/" title="Deirdre McNamer">Deirdre McNamer</a>, Teresa Jordan, and Page Lambert, among others, read tomorrow, and Friday features Alyson Hagy and Karen Volkman.&nbsp; Most events are at the Tivoli on the Auraria Campus.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copper-nickel.org" title="Copper Nickel">Copper Nickel</a>, the literary magazine of the University of Colorado at Denver, is one of the sponsors of this symposium, and their new issue takes Women Writing the West as its theme.&nbsp; The launch party for the new issue will take place at the Denver Press Club on October 17 (6 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
A few other readings of note: Ron McLarty will discuss his novel set in Colorado, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/ron_mcclartys_art_in_america/C39/L39/" title="Art in America">Art in America</a></I>, tonight at the Boulder Book Store (7:30 p.m.).&nbsp; On Saturday, October 18, Missoula author <a target="_blank" href="http://unbridledbooks.com/freemanwalker.html" title="David Allan Cates">David Allan Cates</a> will read from his new novel, <I>Freeman Walker</I> at Shakespeare and Company (7 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
Finally, the Colorado Book Awards were announced last week.&nbsp; Among the winners were several books that we&#8217;ve featured here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/home_on_the_range_home_land_ranching_and_a_west_that_works/C39/L39/" title="Home Land: Ranching and a West That Works">Home Land: Ranching and a West That Works</a>, by Laura Pritchett, Richard Knight and Jeff Lee (Johnson Books) won for Anthology/Collection, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/flight_risks_gary_schanbachers_migration_patterns/C39/L39/" title="Migration Patterns: Stories">Migration Patterns: Stories</a> by Gary Schanbacher (Fulcrum) won for fiction and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/kirk_johnson_discusses_fossil_treasures_of_the_west_in_cruisin_the_fossil_f/C39/L39/" title="Cruisin' the Fossil Freeway">Cruisin&#8217; the Fossil Freeway</a> by Kirk Johnson, illustrated by Ray Troll (Fulcrum) won for nonfiction.&nbsp; The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/08/reids-no-place-safe-tops-list/" title="complete list of winners is here">complete list of winners is here</a>.

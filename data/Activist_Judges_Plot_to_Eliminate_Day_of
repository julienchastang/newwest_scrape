							Yesterday, I received a startling pre-recorded election message on the phone: "Hi, this is John Andrews, calling as a former senator and a new grandfather.  To protect our families and our freedoms we need to pass term limits for judges, Amendment 40.  I hesitated to call you on Sunday, but activist judges will take away Sunday and all our traditions if we the people don't stop them.  Don't let New Jersey happen here."  That's right: Judges apparently now have the power to eliminate days of the week.  If Sunday is taken from us, what's next: Thursday?  If the judges are going to take a day from us, why can't it be Monday?  <br />
<br />
And that "Don't let New Jersey happen here," remark--I'm guessing that's a thinly veiled reference to the New Jersey Supreme Court's recent ruling that gay couples should have the same legal rights as straight couples.  But the statement is so vague, it could be referencing anything associated with the Garden State that might take root in Colorado: Landfills, Bon Jovi, the Nets.<br />
<br />
Maybe Andrews was afraid that a straightforward mention of the topic of gay rights would be too sensitive right now, as Tim Haggard, deposed pastor of New Life Church and one of the most powerful conservative religious forces in Colorado recently admitted that he's at least a little bit gay.  (Well, what he actually wrote in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5120850,00.html" title="his statement">his statement</a> was "I am guilty of sexual immorality" and "There’s a part of my life that is so repulsive and dark that I have been warring against it for all of my adult life."  Doesn't sound like he's ready to chuckle along to an episode of <i>Queer Eye For the Straight Guy</i> yet.)  <br />
<br />
But what does the fact that a prominent Colorado Springs evangelical leader just admitted to sex-and-drug shenanigans in Denver suggest?  Maybe New Jersey has already happened here.<br />

		<b>Comment By Craig Moore, 11-06-06</b>
		<p>I want a judge that is bold and courageous enough to take away "birthday"  and reclaim our right to youth.  ;)</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Brodie Farquhar, 11-06-06</b>
		<p>Jen: I've done some searching on the Internet, including Andrew's home page, and I can't find anything that correlates with "New Jersey judges" AND "Sunday."<br />
Sounds like previous conservative alarms about so-called liberal attacks on Christmas, Easter, the Bible, etc.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Chief Joseph VII, 11-06-06</b>
		<p>Andrews has always been a blowhard long on rhetoric and short on ideas, albeit with a smiling countenance that served to mask his true agenda. Methinks he now hopes to keep his name in the limelight for future political considerations ('specially with Both Ways Bob about to disappear from Colorado and national contention). <br />
<br />
Andrews' scare tactics remained designed purely to motivate the wingnut base—hopefully, those opposed to his bullshit will be motivated as well. <br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this to our attention!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Joan Opyr, 11-06-06</b>
		<p>Great piece, Jenny!  I hate to bring this to Colorado's attention, but New Jersey is everywhere.  Whenever you eat a chili-covered hotdog, listen to a Springsteen song, or spot Bigfoot (remember, the Jersey Devil pre-dates Sasquatch), you're stepping on the Garden State's territory.<br />
<br />
BTW, I wish someone, somewhere would take away Sunday.  I want to be off work on Monday instead, when all the stores are open.  Also, wouldn't this eliminate the need for a leap year?  That would be a good thing, right?</p>

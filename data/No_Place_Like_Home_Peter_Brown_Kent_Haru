	Not everyone is able to perceive the beauty of the Great Plains.&nbsp; As Kent Haruf writes in his new collaboration with photographer Peter Brown,  &#8220;You have to know how to look at this country.&nbsp; You have to slow down.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t pretty, but it&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;  <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Last-Chance-Kent-Haruf/dp/0393065723" title="West of Last Chance">West of Last Chance</a></I> is a book for people who are in on the secret of the Great Plains, and are able to see beyond the surface emptiness of that swath of America.&nbsp; Brown&#8217;s pictures are beautiful, even when what they capture isn&#8217;t.&nbsp; They are blunt, wide, and full of sky, and sometimes that sky stretches over a slab-like Wal-Mart, an abandoned small town strip, or rolling hills of discarded tires. 
</p>
<p>
	Despite the evidence of economic hardship, population loss, and environmental degradation that some of the photographs in <I>West of Last Chance</I>  capture, blessedly, it doesn&#8217;t feel like an editorial on these issues.&nbsp; This is in large part due to Kent Haruf&#8217;s contributions&#8212;observations, sketches, jokes, and short stories about the people of the prairie, many of them set in the fictional high plains town of Holt, Colorado, where Haruf&#8217;s novels take place.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The typical text to accompany this sort of photography book would be commentary on the landscape, its history, or its economic prospects, perhaps something along the lines of Jim Richardson&#8217;s 2004 cover story for National Geographic, &#8220;The Late Great Plains,&#8221; in which he wrote, &#8220;After years of drought and depopulation, many parts of the Great Plains again meet the 19th-century definition of frontier territory: an area with no more than six people per square mile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But Haruf, whose novels are traditional in structure, has something wilder up his sleeve.&nbsp; Many of his pieces in <I>West of Last Chance</I>  are downright experimental, such as one that reads, in its entirety: &#8220;The little girl in a pale blue summer dress riding an old bicycle on the dirt streets.&nbsp; Behind her the trail of loops and scallops from her tires in the dirt.&#8221;  What is that?&nbsp; A poem?&nbsp; A micro story?&nbsp; Whatever it is, it is intensely visual and evocative of a particular time and place, and so goes along with Peter Brown&#8217;s photos as naturally as Jell-O salad and green bean casserole at a church potluck (such as the one featured in Haruf&#8217;s most moving story in the book).&nbsp; I&#8217;m a fan of Haruf&#8217;s work, and I was delighted to see him stretching out like this. 
</p>
<p>
I was struck by this snippet that provides an insight about the cultural conditions that pioneers faced on the prairie: &#8220;An old man told me people were so hungry for music back then.&nbsp; If a man was a good whistler they would gather around in the evening and listen to that.&#8221;  It reminded me of the father of the title character in Willa Cather&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Antonia-Enriched-Classics-Pocket/dp/0743487699/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200342617&amp;sr=8-1" title="My &#193;ntonia">My &#193;ntonia</a></I>, an immigrant to Nebraska from Bohemia, who puts aside his beloved fiddle as the conditions become more difficult.
</p>
<p>
Like Haruf&#8217;s writing, Brown&#8217;s photographs often display a particular type of dry Great Plains wit.&nbsp; There&#8217;s one of a graveyard alone in the prairie save for a windmill and one tree.&nbsp; The sign at the entrance reads, &#8220;Halfway Cemetery, Est. 1917.&#8221;  The obvious question that will spring to the mind of any viewer is, &#8220;Halfway to what?&#8221;  Similarly, there&#8217;s a photo of a field with a telephone pole extending off the top of the picture, and next to the pole is a metal post with a two-foot long key dangling from it.&nbsp; So, what&#8217;s the key to?&nbsp; I love these photos because they supply more questions than answers.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In his rambles across the plains, Brown has preserved some wonderful signs that look like they will succumb to the elements soon, such as placards that give visitors directions to find the homes of each of the town&#8217;s inhabitants.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a battered historical marker in Kyle, South Dakota bearing a biography of the &#8220;War Chief Red Cloud,&#8221; whose grave &#8220;lies 200 feet west of this sign.&#8221;  Someone has scrawled, &#8220;Fuck you Red Cloud,&#8221; in small letters, while someone else (presumably) has much more emphatically spray painted &#8220;Red Cloud Kix Ass,&#8221; in a script so large that it obscures most of the biography.&nbsp; At the top of the sign, there&#8217;s this serious notation: &#8220;Penalty for Defacing.&#8221;  I loved the weather-beaten sign that Brown captured in Tahoka Texas, which reads, &#8220;One of the friendliest cities in Texas Lynn County.&#8221;  And one of the most modest, I&#8217;m sure.
</p>
<p>
	I am partial to the plains because of the countless trips my family and I have made from Denver to eastern Nebraska to visit our family there.&nbsp; I never minded the drive.&nbsp; I&#8217;d bring books to read, but half the time I&#8217;d end up gazing out the window for hours, and when I got to my grandparents&#8217; farm I&#8217;d run free with my cousins for days.&nbsp; The land made such a perfect canvas for the imagination.&nbsp; My grandparents lost their farm in the &#8216;80s, something I was too young to understand at the time.&nbsp; Haruf&#8217;s small piece on this subject makes it more clear to me what the adults were going through then:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;People over there in that farmhouse had the first computers in the country.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t save their place though.&nbsp; The 1980s took more than computers.&nbsp; If you remember, there was a suicide hotline for farmers.&nbsp; Ladies on the other end trying to talk grown men out of shooting themselves.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
I find it difficult to write about &#8221;<I>West of Last Chance</I> without adding my own memories and stories to the discussion.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the book will have the same affect on others.&nbsp; Haruf&#8217;s stories and Brown&#8217;s photographs are so open-ended,  they invite this sort of reminiscing.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8217;s one story <I>West of Last Chance</I> brought to mind.&nbsp; When I was in high school, I played softball on a traveling team.&nbsp; This was years after my final visit to my grandparents&#8217; farm, and one of the teams we played was from Strasburg, a little town about forty miles outside of Denver on the eastern plains.&nbsp; We drove out there for a night game, and were surprised to find a stadium with its lights blazing, packed with what must have been the entire population of the town.&nbsp; We Denver kids laughed that all these people had nothing better to do on a summer night than come watch us play softball; we were accustomed to the half-empty stands at our own games, our families scattered, busy doing other things.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Thinking back on this now, I&#8217;m ashamed that we made fun of the country team. The elders of their town probably knew that in a few years, the young people would move, seeking opportunity elsewhere, and they so they were determined to be together for as long as they could, enjoying their summer nights before economic realities dragged the younger generation away.&nbsp; Many of the towns that Peter Brown has photographed proudly root for their high school sports teams; There&#8217;s a sign in Bethune, Colorado that reads &#8220;Home of The Bethune Bobcats, Best Little School in Colo.&#8221;  These towns are emptying, and they are clinging to their children for as long as they can, for dear life.

							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bigheadtodd.com" title="Big Head Todd & The Monsters'">Big Head Todd & The Monsters'</a> publicist announced this week that the Boulder band has composed a â€œtheme songâ€? for the space shuttle Discoveryâ€™s forthcoming mission, and the trio will venture to Kennedy Space Center on July 13 for the shuttleâ€™s launch. BHTM was invited to write a space-themed song by longtime fan John Horan, who works for one of NASAâ€™s contractors and boasts a very long title: Deputy Program Manager for ASRC Aerospace Corporation. On July 12, the song â€œBlue Skyâ€? will be available only on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="iTunes">iTunes</a>, and it will be included on the bandâ€™s next album. Todd Park Mohr and company have a long history of engaging in such unorthodox collaborations and publicity opportunities, a knack that has kept the bandâ€™s members free of day jobs and prosperously making music for over 15 years, all without ever producing an album that became a mainstream national hit.<br />
<br />
After getting its start in the college bar scene and self-releasing albums in 1989 and 1991, BHTM signed with Giant Records, a label that was later rolled into Warner Brothers. While the band has always been popular in Colorado, its widest national success came on the heels of 1993â€™s <i>Sister Sweetly</i>, which included its best-known single, â€œBittersweet.â€? BHTM toured relentlessly throughout the â€˜90s and built a solid fan base, but it never sold enough albums to please Warner Brothers, and so the band happily returned to self-releasing albums with 2002â€™s <i>Riviera</i>.<br />
<br />
BHTM is not a jam band per seâ€”while they do indulge in the occasional extended instrumental, for the most part they hew close to the traditions of Americana and low-key blues-rock and keep their songs under five minutes. Still, the bandâ€™s members seem to have learned from the business example of their financially savvy counterparts in the jam band world, such as fellow Boulder groups The String Cheese Incident, Yonder Mountain String Band, and Leftover Salmon. The formula for jam band success is clear: tour almost without pause, self-release albums so that all profits go to the band, foster a â€œstreet teamâ€? of hardcore fans to promote those albums, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bigheadtodd.com/tour/taping.shtml" title="allow fans to tape and trade tapes of shows">allow fans to tape and trade tapes of shows</a>, and remain open to unusual opportunities.<br />
<br />
For BHTM, this has meant that the band played alongside Don Henley and Glenn Frey at a Democratic Party benefit for Ken Salazarâ€™s Senate campaign last September at the Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, and then accepted an invitation a few months later to play at President Bushâ€™s inauguration. Afraid of offending his liberal fans, Todd Park Mohr explained to <i>Rolling Stone</i> that the band was paid for the Republican gig but not for the Democratic one, saying â€œwe were there for the party, not the Party.â€? Also last January, BHTM was the featured entertainment aboard a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bhtmcruise.com/" title="Caribbean cruise">Caribbean cruise</a> ship, an outing that was so successful that the band will embark on a similar voyage in March of 2006. It was on this cruise that the band met John Horan, who set them up with the NASA gig.<br />
<br />
In recent years, similarly-styled Boulder band The Samples has faltered, plunging into financial ruin so dire that two years ago it started selling something called a â€œLifetime Passâ€? to its fans to raise money, but Big Head Todd and the Monsters appears to be sitting pretty as its high-profile gigs continue. The band has a summer full of touring scheduled and forthcoming regional appearances include a July 14 show at the Steamboat Springs Free Summer Concert Series, a July 28 performance at Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Galavan Center, and an August 12 show at Three Forks, Montanaâ€™s Rockinâ€™ The Rivers festival.

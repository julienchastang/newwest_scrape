							A bizarre, frustrating evening unfolded in front of a capacity crowd at the Glenn Miller Ballroom Wednesday night as Utah writer Terry Tempest Williams was presented with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org" title="Center of the American West">Center of the American West</a> Wallace Stegner Award for 2005.  Hundreds packed the room for the event, which honors â€œan individual who has made a sustained contribution to the cultural identity of the West.â€? Western scholars Patricia Nelson Limerick and Charles Wilkinson introduced Williams and then tried to spark a meaningful conversation with her, but it was clear from the beginning that Williams wasnâ€™t in the proper emotional state to be on stage in front of a crowd. Williams repeatedly broke down in tears, trailed off in the middle of sentences (confessing several times, â€œI just lost my train of thoughtâ€?) and experienced evident difficulty at understanding questions put to her (she often asked that the questions be repeated several times). <br />
<br />
At first it wasnâ€™t apparent why Williams was having such difficultyâ€”she seemed overcome with gratitude at the massive turnout, and even took several photographs of the crowd from the stage.  After rambling for a few inaudible minutes in response to Limerickâ€™s question about why she had become a writer, Williams said, â€œIâ€™m a mess.  This is really difficult.  Iâ€™m not sitting here from a place of strength.  My brother passed away in January of Lymphoma. This year was one of deep contemplation and struggle.  I also just returned home from Rwanda. When the invitation came to travel to Rwanda, I wasnâ€™t in a good place to make the trip.  But we donâ€™t choose where weâ€™re sent.  Thatâ€™s a spiritual belief of mine.â€?  As was typical of the confusing presentation, Williams never clarified who had invited her to Rwanda or what exactly she was doing there.<br />
<br />
During her introduction, Limerick noted that her recent weight loss was due to the â€œfar too early death of my husband.â€? Williams and Limerick are old friends, and they spent much of the evening swapping tales about past that came across as inside jokes and shared memories that were inaccessible (and often inaudible) to the crowd. It felt very much like two grieving women were conducting a private conversation in front of a huge audience, and it was painful to watch.  The normally very entertaining and polished presenter Limerick tried to steer the conversation back around several times toward topics relevant to the West, to Wallace Stegner, and to Williamsâ€™ career as an activist writer, but Williams couldnâ€™t focus. To her credit, she realized that the presentation was alienating and apologized: â€œThis was so indulgent tonight.  I thank you for your patience.  The worst thing you can do is bore an audience, and Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™ve done that.â€?<br />
<br />
Although Williams gradually became more audible, she never recovered from her incoherence. When one audience member asked her what she was working on currently, she said, â€œI donâ€™t know.  But Iâ€™m thinking a lot about prairie dogs, and I think thatâ€™s why I like Boulder, because youâ€™ve been thinking about prairie dogs for a long time, because they have something to teach us about community.â€?  She watched a prairie dog colony for fourteen hours a day over a recent two-week period.  She described behavior she interpreted as prairie dog prayer.  â€œI fell in love with this one prairie dog who would stand at the edge of her burrow in the evening and face the setting sun and put her paws together and stand in that posture for 30 minutes.  In the morning sheâ€™d do the same thing, facing to the east toward the rising sun.â€? She concluded her loopy reflections by stating, â€œI went to Rwanda and learned about the genocide there, and realized that there has been a similar genocide of prairie dogs in this country.â€?  I love prairie dogs as much as the next guy (see http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/2681/), but equating the killing of prairie dogs with the torture and murders of tens of thousands of human beings in Rwanda is morally indefensible. If Rush Limbaugh really did call Williams â€œa left-wing radical environmental wackoâ€? as she claimed, itâ€™s hard to blame him if she goes around making statements like this.<br />
<br />
Last nightâ€™s Wallace Stegner Award was an unfortunate, wasted opportunity.  Terry Tempest Williams was in no state to make a public presentation, and the people at the Center of the American West should have realized this and had the kindness to postpone or shorten the event rather than putting Williams and the audience through a pointless evening.  In addition to fans of Williamsâ€™ work, the audience was filled with college students who were clearly required to attend by their professors.  The teenage boys sitting behind me kept up a running commentary and laugh track that was far more incisive than anything I heard from the stage.  The shame is that after seeing such a woeful presentation, boys like those will never willingly pick up a Terry Tempest Williams book or attend another literary event, which would seem to defeat the purpose of honoring Williams in this way.<br />

		<p>I heard a story once about an obviously drunk Norman Mailer doing a talk at Yale. He tried to debate some of the sniveling pre-law weenies in the crowd on the issues of the day (this was in the early 70s), and they basically made a fool of him. Then he said "Okay, you sit down," produced a thick  manuscript of whatever he was  working on at the time, and started to read  from it. Minutes later he had the crowd spellbound. Too bad Williams couldn't have done the same.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patia Stephens, 11-03-05</b>
		<p>Oh, no. I hope she just had one too many glasses of wine, or that, like many writers, she's simply far less articulate speaking than writing.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Melissa, 11-04-05</b>
		<p>I would be interested in hearing comments from others who attended this event.  I've seen/heard Williams speak nearly a dozen times, and although she's frequently emotional (as is, often, her audience: Williams--because her speaking is so powerful--often moves audience members to tears), I've never heard her come even close to incoherence.<br />
<br />
I'd like to hear other perspectives on the event Shank writes about.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Rember, 11-04-05</b>
		<p>Terry Tempest Williams has devoted much of her writing life to exploring the forces that lie beneath our world, and to understanding their implications for our future. If a prophet of her caliber is made incoherent by grief, we should at least consider that she's grieving for Shank, college boys, and the rest of us.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dianne James, 11-04-05</b>
		<p>Bravo to Terry Tempest Williams for speaking from her heart!  I find this criticism and attack on Terry Tempest Williams to be quite sordid and so very typical of the ignorant.  Shank is obviously out of touch with nature and all its lessons.  And by the way, I am neither an activist or an extremist.. I am simply a fan of the prairie dog and a voice for those who cannot speak.  I founded the Prairie Dog Rescue of RI and currently operate the Midwest Prairie Dog Shelter in Indiana, and have assisted Prairie Dog Specialists in Denver Colorado on relocation.  I challenge anyone with Shanks mentality to come to Indiana to meet a prairie dog up close and personally, prepare themselves for a life changing experience.  There have been countless individuals from every walk of life that have told me "I had no idea!" after meeting members of "The James Gang" or visiting my website: <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prairiedoglover.com">http://www.prairiedoglover.com</a> and learning about the gentle and social nature of the prairie dog.  One testimony was especially moving.. about a man who joined my online Forum to learn how to get close enough to prairie dogs in Boulder, Colorado to shoot them.  During his short membership, I lost two of my older prairie dogs - Belle was 8 and lost her battle with cancer, and Frankie was 12 and died in my arms of a massive coronary.  Their deaths reached this man in a way that changed his life forever.  Here are his words:  "Condolences on the loss of your pet.  I may not share the same feelings for your choice of pet, but none-the-less I am sad that you must experience the pain of loosing a pet.  Remember, they will always be in your heart. I understand where you are coming from from the point of view as a pet.  I too have loved pets and lost them.  The love they give is unconditional (unlike people) and the pain one feels when they pass is just as would be expected if a family member dies."  He then went on to explain how his Dad taught him how to shoot prairie dogs when he was just a boy.  He basically did it because everyone else was doing it.  The story had a happy ending.  He wrote this:  "Rest assured, this weekend, I will only be shooting cans even if there are PDs in the field moving in.  You have inspired me to find a different way to try and get rid of PDs other than killing them."<br />
<br />
In closing, to Terry Tempest Williams:  prairie dog lovers around the world are rallying behind you!<br />
<br />
xoxoxo from Dianne & The James Gang PDs<br />
<br />
Don't forget to say your prayer-ee dog prayers!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sheli Edrough, 11-04-05</b>
		<p>Shank elevates high school teenagers as "critics" - and idealizes Rush Limbaugh.  How can anyone take this "writer" seriously?  She attended the worst school in the state of Colorado, and that is apparent in her writing skills.  Shank's values leave much to be desired.  The shame is that after reading a piece written by this woeful caviler, I will never willingly read another article in the New West again, which would seem to defeat the purpose of honoring Colorado in the way that New West honors writers like Shank.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jonathan Weber, 11-05-05</b>
		<p>Sheli, Jenny Shank is hardly idealizing Rush Limbaugh, that's obviously a rather extreme mis-characterization.  As for the writing, in my opinion it's pretty good even if you don't like what she has to say. I don't really understand why you would never read another article on New West because you disagreed with the views expressed in a particular article. The point is conversation and dialogue, and if people like Terry Tempest Williams cannot be criticized without inviting vituperative personal attack - as opposed to disagreement with the views expressed - then we might as well not even aspire to free speech and free and open discussion.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sheli Edrough, 11-05-05</b>
		<p>Jonathan, if Shanks can dish it out, she ought to be able to take it.  Read my words again - and you will see that my response was a mere mimic of what she wrote.  And <br />
<br />
I quote Shanks:<br />
"The shame is that after seeing such a woeful presentation, boys like those will never willingly pick up a Terry Tempest Williams book or attend another literary event, which would seem to defeat the purpose of honoring Williams in this way."<br />
<br />
And last, I didn't ask you for your opinion.  I was merely giving mine.  Nothing extreme about that dear.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Rain, 11-06-05</b>
		<p>I am also a fan of Terry Tempest Williams but enjoyed this article. To me it's more honest to say what the author felt about how Williams came across that evening. Covering up or sugar coating things because we admire someone is ignoring freedom of speech, trying to pretend nobody goes through something like that, and the very antithesis of freedom of speech. Williams should have the freedom to fail and if a few people don't read her books because of that (something I find unlikely), it's their loss. After reading this piece, I didn't feel any less admiration for Williams than before-- sounds like she's had a terrible year and for anyone who has read her books, she has experienced more than her share in the past. <br />
<br />
The thing that makes New West so good to read is the diversity of articles that one never knows what they will find.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Brodie Farquhar, 11-06-05</b>
		<p>Anyone can have an off day, and I hope that's all that's going on with Williams. I've long enjoyed her books and hope her next public engagement will be better for her and her audience.<br />
This must have been very ackward for Patricia and Charles alike.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Rick Peterson, 11-10-05</b>
		<p>I was there.  I listened to Terry Tempest Williams.  She was not<br />
incoherent.  She was honest.  It was a difficult format.  She could<br />
not fake it.  Never has.  She has seen things.  J. Shenk created her own fiction and pulled words out of context.  The audience gave her a standing ovation.  What's wrong with being raw and human and present.  It was not an evening of polish.<br />
<br />
I watched her sign books, one on one, for two hours before the award.  <br />
<br />
Give her a break.  How much can one give when you feel as she<br />
does?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By sean orlebeck, 6-13-09</b>
		<p>Unfortunately the author of this piece does not realize what agony a writer can experience in life in order to be creative.  Here, if she was different, or incoherent, we have an individual who was honest enough to show it and not put on a public mask.  This was an opportunity for the audience, us and hopefully, the author of this article to learn about the agony of writing.  Instead of looking out for Rush, it would be best if the author take a deep look inside to see if there is anything there other than the skim of media represented by R.L. and other popular media moguls.</p>

	Northern Idaho-based novelist Denis Johnson has followed up his sprawling, National-Book Award winning <I>Tree of Smoke</I> with <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Move-Novel-Denis-Johnson/dp/0374222908/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1243630976&amp;sr=8-1" title="Nobody Move">Nobody Move</a></I>, a quick book he&#8217;s described as &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/onstage-with-denis-johnson/#more-430" title="cheap pulp fiction">cheap pulp fiction</a>.&#8221;  <I>Playboy</I> serialized the novel last year, and it&#8217;s a wild, bullet-riddled ride that begins, oddly enough, as Jimmy Luntz takes the stage with the Alhambra California Beachcomber Chordsmen, a barbershop chorus entered in a competition in which they finish seventeenth out of twenty.&nbsp; But Johnson leaves this intriguing world behind the moment after he presents it, as the book moves relentlessly forward, chasing the trouble that Luntz gets into over a gambling debt to a smalltime Bakersfield gangster named Juarez.
</p>
<p>
	As he leaves the competition, dressed in a &#8220;blinding white tux,&#8221; Luntz encounters Gambol, &#8220;A tall, sad man in expensive slacks and shoes, camel-hair sports coat, one of those white straw hats that senior-citizen golfers wear.&#8221;  Juarez has sent Gambol to collect Luntz, who has fallen behind on his payments.&nbsp; Johnson jumps ahead then to the moment after Luntz has shot Gambol in the leg and is calling an ambulance.&nbsp; &#8220;Am I supposed to sit around and wait for you to break my arm?&#8221; he says to the bleeding Gambol.&nbsp; Luntz has never shot anybody before, and his lack of nerve in failing to finish Gambol off has dire repercussions.&nbsp; He takes off with Gambol&#8217;s fat wallet in his Cadillac, while Gambol crawls away to hide himself from the police.&nbsp; Gambol calls Juarez, who says he knows a vet who might be able to doctor him.
</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, the beautiful Anita Desilvera is downing massive quantities of vodka so she won&#8217;t have to think about the legal penalties she faces because her lawyer husband (soon to be ex) has framed her in a $2.3 million embezzlement scheme he cooked up with a crooked judge.&nbsp; She ends up drinking and performing bad karaoke in the same bar that Luntz fetches up at when he&#8217;s trying to figure out a plan.&nbsp; They hook up and team up once they realize they are both in dire predicaments, and Anita turns out to be as ruthless as any gangster she encounters.
</p>
<p>
	The vet Juarez sends to pick up the wounded Gambol turns out to be not a veterinarian but a veteran military nurse, Mary, who also is Juarez&#8217;s ex-wife.&nbsp; She becomes one of the most interesting characters in this motley lot, a &#8220;hefty blond&#8221; tending to Gambol&#8217;s wounds in a makeshift way at her home, using supplies she stole from her last legitimate medical gig.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a full-service nurse, cooking up steak-and-egg breakfasts and administering sexual favors along with pain medication.&nbsp; Before Gambol is sufficiently healed, against Mary&#8217;s advice, he limps out on the hunt for revenge.
</p>
<p>
	<I>Nobody Move</I> rides on its dialogue, which is hard-bitten and snappy, as in this exchange in which Juarez tells Luntz about the sort of revenge he can expect for what he did to Gambol:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Listen to me, Luntz.&nbsp; Do you remember this fucker Cal from Anaheim, they called him Cal Trans?&#8217;
<br />
&#8216;Yeah, sure, I heard all about that stuff.&#8217;
<br />
&#8216;Gambol and I sat down and made a meal of his balls.&nbsp; Anaheim oysters.&nbsp; Very tasty.&#8217;
<br />
&#8216;I heard all about it, yeah.&#8217;
<br />
&#8216;What about Luntzville?&nbsp; They make pretty good oysters there?&#8217;
<br />
Luntz said, &#8216;Best oysters in the world, Juarez,&#8217; and hung up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Johnson doesn&#8217;t spend much space on description, but when he does he achieves an evocative noir poetry: &#8220;After the film it was raining, a light, steady rain.&nbsp; Ruthless neon on the wet streets like busted candy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The rest of the plot consists of a chase, some double-crossing, and a big violent finale.&nbsp; The tension often surfaces as an agonizing undercurrent to the characters&#8217; light banter, especially in a scene where Juarez and Gambol prepare to collect some more Anaheim oysters.&nbsp; <I>Nobody Move</I> is simultaneously  retro and up-to-the-minute, echoing past crime novels, yet making its own fresh music.&nbsp; With its quick cuts, witty language, and plentiful violence, <I>Nobody Moves</I> feels like it&#8217;s already a movie and reads like a guilty pleasure.

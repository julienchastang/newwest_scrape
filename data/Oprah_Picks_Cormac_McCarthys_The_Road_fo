							Oprah Winfrey just announced that her <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oprah.com/books/books_landing.jhtml" title="book club ">book club </a>will feature <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cormacmccarthy.com/" title="Cormac McCarthy's">Cormac McCarthy's</a> most recent novel <i>The Road</i>, a brawny choice that should surprise many who have dissed her picks as weepy confessionals.  Oprah described the book as "unlike anything I've ever chosen as a book club selection before because it's post-apocalyptic."  The reclusive McCarthy, who doesn't tour and rarely gives interviews, will submit to his first televised interview when the book club episode airs.  This is the first time Oprah has selected a work of fiction by a living author for her book club since 2004's selection of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

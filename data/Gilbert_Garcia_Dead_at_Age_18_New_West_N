		<h1>Gilbert Garcia, Dead at Age 18</h1>

							<p>When I read that the name of the teenager who was shot and killed in Denver Thursday was Gilbert Garcia, I thought, it can&#8217;t be him.&nbsp; It can&#8217;t be the Gilbert Garcia that I know. The article said the shooting was suspected to be &#8220;gang related,&#8221; so I knew that the victim couldn&#8217;t be the young man I had met when he was a chubby twelve-year-old.&nbsp; Gilbert is a college student now, I thought, and had never had anything to do with gangs.&nbsp; But this morning I saw Gilbert&#8217;s mother on the front page of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5345913,00.html" title=&#8221;<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>&#8221;><i>Rocky Mountain News</i></a>, her family photos spread out before her, and I knew. 
</p>
<p>
I met Gilbert Garcia through the Challenge Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides mentorship, enrichment activities, and high school scholarships to bright, impoverished Denver kids.&nbsp; The young lady that I mentored from when she was twelve years old until her graduation last spring from high school was in the same group of kids as Gilbert.&nbsp; The Challenge Foundation only accepts a handful of kids a year, screening them and their families extensively to make certain they will be able to endure the academic and social rigors of the program.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Gilbert was one of these hand-picked few.&nbsp; He was matched with a wonderful mentor, John Coombe, a former vice chancellor at the University of Denver.&nbsp; John taught the kids a public speaking class during the Challenge Foundation&#8217;s intensive summer program, and I remember seeing Gilbert, who was always smiling and joking, attempt to keep a serious expression while he make a presentation in front of his peers.
</p>
<p>
I remember hearing John talk about how they&#8217;d discovered that Gilbert was dyslexic, a fact that the public schools hadn&#8217;t uncovered during the first twelve years of his life.&nbsp; They were working with specialists to help Gilbert overcome his difficulties.&nbsp; That was the attitude we always took with the kids--you have difficulties and challenges along the way, but you can learn from them, you can defeat them and become stronger.&nbsp; But this morning I know that there are some blows from which you can draw no redeeming message.&nbsp; There is nothing we can learn from Gilbert&#8217;s death at age 18.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a disgusting, unfathomable loss.&nbsp; I could barely look at my baby daughter this morning.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to imagine what it would be like to lose her.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In the last few years of his life, Gilbert grew tall and strong and lost his baby fat.&nbsp; He graduated from high school at Machebeuf and he started his freshman year at Adams State College.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5345913,00.html" title="According to the article in the paper today">According to the article in the paper today</a>, he wanted to be a nurse.&nbsp; He wanted to help his family move out of the troubled neighborhood where they lived.&nbsp; But he was shot in the head last week, driving his car a few blocks from home.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t a gang member.&nbsp; He was a happy young man, a good brother and son.&nbsp; The city of Denver should mourn his death, because he and other young people like him are its brightest hope.&nbsp; He wasn&#8217;t a football star--he was just a person who enriched the lives of those around him through the simple decency of his life.
</p>
<p>
My hands are trembling, my heart is pounding, and I don&#8217;t know what to say.

		<p>I REALLY WANTED TO COMMENT ON THIS ARTICLE BECAUSE UNLIKE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT OF THE SHOOTING WAS "GANG-RELATED". I THOUGHT IN MY HEART THAT SOMEONE THAT NICE WOULD END UP DEAD HE WAS A GREAT PERSON AND DIED TO SOON HE HAD A CARRER PLAN AND 18 YRS OF HARD WORK WAS TAKIN AWAY IN ONE DAY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT EVERONE SHOULD REMEMBER HIM AS HE WAS A HARD WORKING PERSON WITH A MUSCULAR BODY AND A BIG HEART AND SMILE NOT A SUPPOSIBLE "GANG BANGER".</p>

&#8226; Here&#8217;s an interesting conference that I&#8217;d never heard of before&#8212;the 19th Annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.literarysojourn.org/" title="Literary Sojourn">Literary Sojourn</a> in Steamboat Springs, Colo. Perhaps I&#8217;d never heard of it because they feature such popular and acclaimed writers that they don&#8217;t need to advertise&#8212;this year&#8217;s lineup includes Jennifer Egan, who won the National Book Award, Pulitzer Prize, and the Los Angeles Times Book Award for <I>A Visit From the Goon Squad</I> (I knew <I>Goon Squad</I> was a winner way back when I reviewed it for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/headlines/20100620-Book-review-A-Visit-9587.ece" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a>). If Egan isn&#8217;t enough of a draw, Peter Matthiessen, Paula McLain, Julie Orringer, Jim Shepard, and Julia Glass will be there. Tickets for the Sojourn, which takes place September 10, are on sale now ($75).

<p>
&#8226; And for those looking ahead to the fall, the <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.womenwritingthewest.org/currentWWWConference.html" title="Women Writing the West conference">Women Writing the West conference</a>, to be held in Lynnwood, Wash. from October 14 through 16, is open for registration now.

	Boulder writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joycechapmanlebra.com/" title="Joyce Lebra">Joyce Lebra</a> was a Professor of Japanese History and Indian History at the University of Colorado for nearly 30 years, and wrote many nonfiction books before publishing her first novel this year, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Scent-Sake-Joyce-Lebra/dp/0061662372/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1240337309&amp;sr=8-1" title="The Scent of Sake">The Scent of Sake</a></I>.&nbsp; The novel is a family saga that cycles around one remarkable woman, and immerses the reader in the world of sake brewing in 19th century Japan.&nbsp; Rie is born into the Omura house, sake brewers for generations, and because of the death of her younger brother, for which she feels responsible, Rie must marry a man of her parents&#8217; choosing who will move to their house and carry on the sake tradition.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The matchmaker selects Jihei, the son of another brewer, to marry Rie, and she instantly finds him distasteful, &#8220;with a large nose and eyebrows that stood up straight like her father&#8217;s.&#8221;  Rie is an obedient daughter, and does nothing to oppose the match that her family hopes will strengthen the brewery.&nbsp; But Jihei turns out to be a callous drunk who spends all his time with geishas, and he has no instinct for the business, so Rie begins to influence the operations from behind the scenes, as no woman is allowed to enter the area where the sake is brewed because of the belief that a woman&#8217;s presence will cause the sake to sour.
</p>
<p>
Rie submits to her husband&#8217;s rough attentions in the hope that she will become pregnant, but she miscarries her first pregnancy, and a geisha that Jihei patronizes has a son first.&nbsp; They bring the boy into the house to train as the future house head, as was the custom.&nbsp; Rie arranges a tryst with the man she loves, and gives birth to his daughter.&nbsp; Jihei fathers two daughters with geishas, and Rie decides to adopt them in order to enlarge the house, even though this is unorthodox and causes a stir in the community. 
<br />
 
<br />
<I>The Scent of Sake</I> is filled with soap-opera-worthy dramatic turns like these throughout, with lovers&#8217; suicide pacts, rampaging Samurai, loveless marriages, spousal rape, and the sudden deaths of many characters.&nbsp; At times Lebra&#8217;s writing technique is not as strong or subtle as it might be, such as when she uses dialogue for exposition, as in this moment when two characters explain something for the reader&#8217;s benefit that both of them would already know: &#8220;I heard a few people wondering about our recipe, which of course we don&#8217;t share.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Three different scenes in which geishas are told they must give up their children to the Omura house are virtually identical, with little differentiation of the characters.&nbsp; Sometimes Lebra over-explains, such as when Rie vigorously washes out sake barrels, something that the reader learns many times that she always does when she&#8217;s angry.&nbsp; Instead of letting the reader infer Rie&#8217;s mood after we&#8217;ve seen this action repeatedly, a character says, &#8220;You can always tell how angry she is by the way she washes the barrels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Still, Rie emerges as a fascinating, strong character over the course of the novel, growing from a somewhat timid 19-year-old girl into a formidable businesswoman, appreciating the advantages of each new technological development, such as using brick instead of wood for the sake-brewing kuras, expanding the business into other areas, including money lending, and buying their own ships instead of renting space in others&#8217; vessels.&nbsp; Rie holds nothing above the business, which at times leads to personal catastrophe in the lives of her family and workers.&nbsp; At one point she forces her top employee to divorce his wife because she gossiped about the business, and he obeys.
</p>
<p>
The precise details that Lebra invests each scene with bring the world of 19th-century Japan to life, as in this description: &#8220;[Rie&#8217;s] mother&#8217;s room was a large eight-tatami room with a two-tatami dressing room adjacent.&nbsp; It was sparsely furnished according to Japanese sensibility: a low lacquerware table, the hibachi, the paulownia dressing cabinet and <I>zabuton</I> completed the appointments.&#8221;  Lebra&#8217;s profound knowledge of the setting is palpable on every page, but it never overwhelms the narrative as it might.&nbsp; Instead it creates an intensely sensory reading experience, with the sights, sounds, and smells vividly evoked.&nbsp; The details of the inner workings of this sake-brewing establishment, the Omura&#8217;s business deals, their relationships with other brewers and the community, and how all of these evolve to keep step with different historical events are also fascinating.
</p>
<p>
Although Rie is never fulfilled in her love life, <I>The Scent of Sake</I> nevertheless develops into a fine romance, as Rie&#8217;s passion for and success in the sake business ultimately assuages all her heartbreaks.&nbsp; On her website Lebra reports that she is at work on two more novels set in Hawaii and India, and given her success in rendering the world of <I>The Scent of Sake</I>, she is well on her way to becoming a strong voice in historical fiction.

		<h1>Montana Festival of the Book Brings Crime Fiction Superstars to Missoula</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 10-20-09</p>
			
			
							<p>This year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitiesmontana.org/BookFestival/bookfest.php" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a>, which begins Thursday, has an incredible lineup scheduled.&nbsp; The October 23 reading with humorist David Sedaris is sold out, but there&#8217;s so much else going on that nobody who missed out on tickets for that event should go home with an empty brain.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, October 22, four renowned crime novelists will participate in the panel discussion &#8221;<i>The Last Good Kiss</i>: An Appreciation of James Crumley.&#8221; Michael Koepf will interview Dennis Lehane, George Pelecanos, Laura Lippman and James Grady about &#8220;the work of Montana mystery writer James Crumley and its impact on the mystery genre and literature as a whole&#8221; (Wilma Theatre, 3 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
Many writers of some of the great books I&#8217;ve reviewed here over the past few years will offer readings, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_maile_meloy/C39/L39/" title="Maile Meloy">Maile Meloy</a> (with Dennis Lehane and Andrew Sean Greer on Thursday, October 22, Wilma Theater, 7:30 p.m.), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/disappearing_dads_marianne_wiggins_the_shadow_catcher/C39/L39/" title="Marianne Wiggins">Marianne Wiggins</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/looking_for_love_in_all_the_wrong_places_kevin_cantys_where_the_money_went/C39/L39/" title="Kevin Canty">Kevin Canty</a> (with James Lee Burke, October 24, Wilma Theater, 7:30 p.m.), and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/dad_in_the_woods_rick_basss_the_wild_marsh/C39/L39/" title="Rick Bass">Rick Bass</a> (October 24, Holiday Inn, 11 a.m.).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Bass and Wiggins will participate on a panel discussion called &#8220;Locating the Novel&#8221; that sounds fascinating, described in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.missoulian.com/entertainment/books-and-literature/article_361e5904-ba09-11de-af94-001cc4c002e0.html?print=1" title="The Missoulian">The Missoulian</a> in this way: &#8220;Some novels are &#8216;high concept.&#8217; Some authors start out with a setting, a room, a landscape. And sometimes the story begins with the sound of a voice, a character. How does the &#8216;initiating impulse&#8217; affect the final product? And do some authors only hear voices while others always see visions?&#8221; (October 23, with Andrew Sean Greer, and Peter Orner, Holiday Inn, 2:30 p.m.)
</p>
<p>
The one presentation that makes me wish teleportation existed so that I could just zap myself up to Missoula is &#8220;&#8216;The Wire,&#8217; An Interview,&#8221; with the show&#8217;s creator David Simon, and George Pelecanos, one of the show&#8217;s co-producers and writers (Holiday Inn, October 24, 1 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
Like a lot of people, I am completely obsessed with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire/" title="The Wire">The Wire</a>.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t have cable television, so I&#8217;ve caught all the episodes on DVD.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing I find more relaxing after a long day of looking after my kids than to sit on the couch and immerse myself in the Baltimore ghetto, particularly when the screenplays are written by George Pelecanos and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price_(writer)" title="Richard Price ">Richard Price </a>(with whose writing I&#8217;m also mildly obsessed). I&#8217;ve learned a lot about parenting from The Wire, such as the importance of setting up a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsterdam" title="Hamsterdam">Hamsterdam</a> where all the things you&#8217;ve forbidden the kids to do in other parts of the house are permitted.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to books:
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Kim Wyatt, publisher and editor of Bona Fide Books recently wrote in with a call for submissions for a new anthology, <i>Permanent Vacation: Living and Working in Our National Parks</i>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bona Fide Books seeks literary essays for a collection about life and work in our national parks. Diverse park experiences desired. Although we enjoy tree-hugging epiphanies, we also want to read about day-to-day life, and the societal, environmental, and existential implications of living in the park. What happened there, and how did it influence your life? Writers will receive $100 for their essay and one copy of the collection. Deadline: January 5, 2010. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bonafidebooks.com/permanent-vacation/" title="www.bonafidebooks.com">www.bonafidebooks.com</a> for guidelines.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&#8226; Boise&#8217;s JR Walsh won Esquire Magazine&#8217;s recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esquire.com/fiction-contest-authors" title="fiction contest">fiction contest</a>.&nbsp; Esquire&#8217;s editors assigned three possible titles for entries of 4,000 words or less, and over 3,000 writers submitted stories.&nbsp; Walsh chose the title &#8220;An Insurrection&#8221; for his offbeat love story.&nbsp; He wins $2,500 and publication in Esquire.&nbsp; He told the magazine he&#8217;s working on &#8220;a novel involving a blanket.&#8221;
<br />
 
<br />
&#8226; The annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visitsunvalley.com/static/index.cfm?contentID=548" title="Sun Valley Hemingway Festival">Sun Valley Hemingway Festival</a> takes place this week in Idaho, with events on October 22 through 24.&nbsp; Speakers include Hemingway experts Scott Donaldson, Susan F. Beegel, David M. Earle, and Sandra Hofferber, who will lead a &#8220;Hemingway Haunts&#8221; tour on October 23 (1:30-3:30 p.m.).&nbsp; The highlight of the weekend will require deep pockets: On Saturday there will be an &#8220;elegant dinner&#8221; at Hemingway&#8217;s last residence.&nbsp; Tickets are $1000 a person, and the proceeds benefit the Nature Conservancy.

<p>
&#8226; The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518131" title="Denver Post">Denver Post</a> recently featured Denver novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/mix_and_match_carleen_brices_children_of_the_waters/C39/L39/" title="Carleen Brice">Carleen Brice</a> in its regular series on the homes of people in the Denver area.&nbsp; But while they usually highlight fabulous homes of designers or architects, as Elana Ashanti Jefferson writes, Brice&#8217;s place is &#8220;down-to-earth,&#8221; a &#8220;one-story, two-bedroom house in Park Hill.&#8221;  Jefferson wrote of Brice&#8217;s recent accomplishments:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;But few other aspects of the life and home of this rising literary star have changed since her 2008 debut novel, &#8220;Orange Mint and Honey,&#8221; made Essence magazine&#8217;s recommended-reading list and was optioned by the Lifetime Movie Network. Lifetime recently moved forward with turning Brice&#8217;s coming-of-age story about the daughter of an alcoholic into a movie featuring one of the author&#8217;s own muses, singer and poet Jill Scott.&nbsp; Brice&#8217;s second novel, &#8220;Children of the Waters,&#8221; came out earlier this year. And now she is working on her third.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
But, Brice noted, &#8220;I&#8217;m still broke.&#8221;

&#8226; Finally, Westminster, Colo.-based novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="David Wroblewski">David Wroblewski</a>, author of the best-selling Oprah&#8217;s Book Club pick <i>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</i>, is on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidwroblewski.com/events.html" title="a nationwide tour">a nationwide tour</a> for the paperback edition of the book.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll be back in our neck of the woods on November 2, when he&#8217;ll deliver a lecture for the Denver Post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.penandpodium.com/default.asp" title="Pen and Podium Series">Pen and Podium Series</a> in Denver, and he&#8217;ll follow that up with a December 8 appearance at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a>.

		<b>Comment By Carter Young, 10-20-09</b>
		<p>I'm also excited about Pelecanos and Lehane coming to the Montana Festival of the Book, although neither of them have written much of anything about the area (except I seem to remember that perhaps part of "Shoedog" was set on our side of the Mississippi). When I first heard about their attendance, it seemed odd, until I learned that they were coming, in part, to give tribute to Jim Crumley, an acknowledged favorite of both writers.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By lluke84, 10-22-09</b>
		<p>I am really looking forward to the next festival. Any recommendations on which&lt;a &gt;bozeman hotels&lt;/a&gt; to stay at ?</p>

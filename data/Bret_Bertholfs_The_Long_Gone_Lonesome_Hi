I&#8217;ve only been a mother for under a year, but already I think I know a thing or two about children&#8217;s books: Any that you buy, you&#8217;re going to be reading repeatedly, so the words and drawings have to be as amusing to the parent as they are to the kid.&nbsp; Bret Bertholf, a Denver-based musician, artist, and children&#8217;s book author, seems to know this.&nbsp; Hilarious, informative, and quirky, Bertholf&#8217;s <I>The Long Gone Lonesome History of Country Music</I> was so enjoyable I felt like reading it aloud even after my baby was asleep.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Bertholf is an accomplished artist&#8212;his drawings are so detailed and imaginative that it&#8217;s possible to discover something new each time you look at them&#8212;and he knows a thing or two about country music.&nbsp; For several years, his alter ego has served as the yodeling front man for Denver country outfit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hibeams.com/index.cfm" title="Halden Wofford and the Hi-Beams">Halden Wofford and the Hi-Beams</a>.&nbsp; So when he gives youngsters a lesson in yodeling (&#8220;First, pretend you&#8217;re swallowing a monkey.&nbsp; Now, sing a high note and get your best friend to pinch your posterior.&nbsp; A healthy YELP will get you yodeling.&#8221;), you know it&#8217;s legit. 
</p>
<p>
The book is filled with wonderful, penciled caricatures of country musicians drawn in the time-honored big head, tiny body tradition.&nbsp; Adults will have fun trying to guess who the musicians are (there&#8217;s a key at the back of the book), and kids will doubtless want to know more about these funny-looking people, from the rock &#8216;em sock &#8216;em cowboy singer Gene Autry to the singular Minnie Pearl, who looks like she&#8217;s about to jump out of the page and tell a joke.
</p>
<p>
Although the history of country music is a tangled tale, Bertholf has structured it well, working in roughly chronological order from country&#8217;s southern agrarian roots, taking it through the Depression, World War II, and the rise of suburbia, with welcome stop-offs in such topics as &#8220;Country Hair,&#8221; &#8220;Country Vee-hickles,&#8221; and how to dress like a country singer.&nbsp; (Under the caricature of a clothier, he writes, &#8220;My name is Nudie Cohn, and I made the wildest, most colorful, flashy rhinestone-studded, glow-in-the-dark cowboy suits you&#8217;ll ever see&#8230;Some of the clothes I made were so shiny you couldn&#8217;t even look at them.&#8221;)  Even in the passages that cover dark topics&#8212;this is country music after all&#8212;Bertholf keeps it fun.&nbsp; As he writes of the Depression, &#8220;Sometimes the only thing people got to eat was soup.&nbsp; SOUP!&nbsp; You had to wait in line to get soup.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This book is full of delights, from the page on &#8220;Country Pets&#8221; which includes the &#8220;Mean-Eyed Cat,&#8221; to the guide to creating your own country nicknames.&nbsp; (Mine, apparently, is Skeeter Pooter.)  If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how country music changed between Jimmie Rodgers and Shania Twain, <I>The Long Gone Lonesome History of Country Music</I> offers an enjoyable way to find out.&nbsp; The only drawback to this book is that it doesn&#8217;t come with a companion CD.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s up to Ma and Pa to dig into the record collection and provide a multi-media experience.

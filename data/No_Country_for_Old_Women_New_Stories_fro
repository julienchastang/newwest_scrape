	Swallow Press recently published the first edition of <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Stories-Southwest-Ray-Gonzalez/dp/0804011079/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206649722&amp;sr=8-1" title="New Stories from the Southwest">New Stories from the Southwest</a></I>.&nbsp; This collection, which editor D. Seth Horton drew from stories that appeared in hundreds of literary magazines in 2007, is diverse and diverting, including a variety of writing styles, taking place in Arizona, New Mexico, west Texas and the southern parts of Utah, Colorado, Nevada, and California.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The thirsty, dusty landscape is a common feature, and some familiar Southwest icons turn up, such as the famous Ansel Adams photograph in Alan Cheuse&#8217;s story &#8220;Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico, 1941,&#8221; which imagines the picture&#8217;s genesis, and the St. Francis of Assisi church in Ranchos de Taos, frequently depicted by Georgia O&#8217;Keefe and Ansel Adams, which plays a role in Matt Clark&#8217;s &#8220;The Secret Heart of Christ.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Clark&#8217;s story is one of the most striking in the book, a meandering metafictional novella, in which Clark tells several stories at once&#8212;that of a college teacher supervising students on a summer campus in Taos, the story that the teacher writes, about a woman who oversees a church&#8217;s relic, and bits of advice on story structure, flights of fancy, and observations mixed in.&nbsp; The narrator faces some complications&#8212;as he writes, &#8220;Confession and clarification: I&#8217;m gay.&nbsp; Nobody out here knows this.&nbsp; The administration would be very unhappy to learn of my aberrant lifestyle.&#8221;  
<br />
At first I was wary to wade into this metafiction with all its stops and starts, but each of Clark&#8217;s asides, journal entries, and notes about the students&#8217; petty complaints were so astute and entertaining that he quickly won me over, and by the end of this 60-page adventure, I was genuinely saddened to turn to the contributors&#8217; notes and find that Clark had died in 1998 at age thirty-one.
</p>
<p>
	It may be just a coincidence unrelated to the southwest setting of these stories, but many of them feature ailing or dead mothers, wives, and grandmothers.&nbsp; There&#8217;s Maury Sandoval&#8217;s dead wife in Alan Elysevitz&#8217;s &#8220;Hermano,&#8221; the loss of whom has left Maury cranky and hostile to the wishes of the community.&nbsp; Charles Kemnitz&#8217;s &#8220;The Fifth Daughter&#8221; features a woman suffering from cancer caused by uranium mining on the reservation where she lived.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the unnamed &#8220;old man&#8217;s wife&#8221; in S.G. Miller&#8217;s &#8220;Old Border Road&#8221; who takes to her bed and dies in this bleak story featuring abundant dust and rotten luck with in-laws.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
And in the most shocking dead mother example, in Elmo Lum&#8217;s &#8220;What I Never Said,&#8221; a family van trip through the southwest goes horribly wrong, and ends with a father instructing his three sons to help bury their mother in the desert.&nbsp; I enjoyed this story for the way it began as a tale of a typical experience&#8212;car trouble and disagreement among the parents on a road trip, told from the perspective of a young boy&#8212;and then took a fork in the road to some unexpected, macabre territory.&nbsp; Judging from the stories in this collection, the southwest is no country for old women.&nbsp; Or even middle-aged ones with a slight cough.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there are plenty of lighter moments mixed in among all these tales of dying women, such as &#8220;Cowboys and Indians&#8221; by Lorien Crow, which, okay, does take place on the day of the funeral for the narrator&#8217;s grandmother, but features two winning and believable characters: the narrator, who is Navajo, but looked on with suspicion by her family because she lives on the east coast, and her cousin David, who &#8220;is six-foot-six, owns four motorcycles, and works for one of the big oil companies.&#8221;  Upon her request, David whisks his cousin off on his Ducati to escape the stifling atmosphere of post-funeral formality, and they cruise the beautiful landscape together and end up at a bar.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some great dialogue, such as David&#8217;s line, delivered during a reflective moment, &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the world, but I just can&#8217;t seem to get the fuck out of here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I loved John Tait&#8217;s &#8220;Reasons for Concern Regarding My Girlfriend of Five Days, Monica Garza,&#8221; which chronicles the brief fling of a divorced, middle-aged, white, community college teacher with a young, beautiful Latina.&nbsp; The story cycles from the &#8220;Reasons for Concern,&#8221; to &#8220;Notable Insecurities at the Two-Week Mark with New Girlfriend, Monica Garza,&#8221; such as &#8220;Because I am so white and so lame at times when I&#8217;m with her that I feel like Lawrence freaking Welk,&#8221; and:
<br />
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Because my best friend is named Doug, who is an actuary who is married to another actuary, and they live with two golden labs in a gated community called Idle Pines, and Monica&#8217;s best friend is named Analeticia, who is a manicurist who dates a guy I think is named Puppet who drives a chopped Civic with &#8216;&#161;Chingalo!&#8217; in gothic script on the back windshield, and both Analeticia and Puppet stared at me with stony incomprehension the only time we met.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The story is daring in its humor, unafraid seek the truth that can be hidden amid stereotypes.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	Horton doesn&#8217;t make it clear whether or not another edition of <I>New Stories from the Southwest</I> will appear every year, but hopefully it will, because it would be a welcome edition from the West to the to the annual group of short story anthologies, such as <I>New Stories from the South</I>, which has been going strong for decades.

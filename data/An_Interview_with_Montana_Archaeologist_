							<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.larrylahren.com/" title="Larry Lahren">Larry Lahren</a> is a Livingston, Montana-based archaeologist who founded <a target="_blank" href="http://www.larrylahren.com/services/index.html" title="Anthro Research, Inc.">Anthro Research, Inc.</a>, which his website describes as a &#8220;cultural resource consulting firm.&#8221;  Recently Lahren compiled essays based on research that he has completed over his almost four decades as an archaeologist into the book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.larrylahren.com/homeland/index.html" title="Homeland: An Archaeologist's view of Yellowstone Country's Past">Homeland: An Archaeologist&#8217;s view of Yellowstone Country&#8217;s Past</a>.&nbsp; Dr. Lahren briefly answered my questions about the book via email, discussing Montana&#8217;s earliest people and his favorite discoveries.
</p>
<p>
<b>NewWest: What prompted you to collect the articles you have written over the course of your archaeology career into this book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Larry Lahren:</b> The articles reflect the sites and materials that I have worked on and I connect them through time with each example essay. Each essay can stand alone as a teaching, information or source reference. 
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: Why did you decide to include a personal family history at the beginning of <I>Homeland</I>?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: To develop a context about what &#8220;Home&#8221; is from my socialization, the cultural ethic of the time, and how it affected my perspective and career in archaeology and now as a county commissioner.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: You write about how the Rocky Mountains have traditionally been seen as a barrier between cultures rather than a homeland. How did people make their home in the mountains?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: The way is indicated in the Good Camp on the Big Bend of the Yellowstone and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.larrylahren.com/homeland/homeland_xi.html" title="Dozer Rock">Dozer Rock</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/mummy.htm" title="Mummy Cave">Mummy Cave</a> site in Wyoming. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Is less material likely to be preserved or discovered in mountainous areas than in flatter places? </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: No
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: What is known about Montana&#8217;s earliest people from the Clovis burial site you mention and from other evidence?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: That since this time (11,000 years ago) people were living in Montana and considered it a Homeland, as demonstrated by tools left and as a burial.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: What have you and researchers such as Ray Alt (who studies bow hunting) learned about past societies from employing their hunting techniques? </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: How efficient these people were with a very basic technology. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Are hunting techniques a special focus of your research?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Yes. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Do all archaeologists study tools and weapons extensively because they are made of material that has a better chance of surviving?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Part of this is true and many archaeologists &#8220;worship&#8221; stone artifacts such as projectile points - we try to get into the mind and technology of the past peoples.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: You note that a psychic visited the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerfirstamericans.org/mt.php?a=32" title="Anzick">Anzick</a> site and offered his reading of the people whose remains were found there.&nbsp; Did you invite him?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: No I did not invite him, it was a suggestion of some New Age, crystal-alignment-for-harmonious-convergence people that thought it would be of value.&nbsp; 
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: You write that the deer antlers you found in the Dozer Rock site seemed to have been placed in their respective positions. What do you speculate about this - was it part of a ceremony?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Actually these mule deer skull caps and antlers were found at the <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eh1pCeeNHWQC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=%22dead+indian+site%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Z3WG3nFjPd&amp;sig=XIYyyb-arOsHRvFAc_swsJMwzbY#PPA79,M1" title="Dead Indian site">Dead Indian site</a> in Wyoming and suggest a mule deer hunting cult/ritual situation. 
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crystalinks.com/bighorn.html" title="Bighorn Medicine Wheel">Bighorn Medicine Wheel</a> is striking. What do you know about it?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Note the tie in with other circular features that are illustrated in the same area, definitely a  religious structure.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: How did the introduction of the horse change the lifestyle of Montana&#8217;s indigenous people?</b> 
<br />
 
<br />
<b>LL</b>: A revolution!
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: How is being an independent consultant different from being an archaeologist for a museum or university?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Totally different: no teaching and no treadmill and totally different politics.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: What is the most exciting or unusual discovery you&#8217;ve made over the course of your career?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Definitely Myers-Hindman.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t discover, but documented Anzick, which still keeps me in awe.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Have you ever had your prior notions challenged or changed by something you have found in the field?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LL</b>: Again Myers-Hindman and Anzick . I work with an open mind and have never been totally stuck in a one-theory mode.

		<b>Comment By Carol Lee-Roark, 9-04-07</b>
		<p>Hi -- it is not immediately clear how the link from Myers-Hindman relates to that reference.  Could someone please explain?<br />
<br />
thanks!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 9-04-07</b>
		<p>Hi Carol,<br />
<br />
I think I linked to the wrong article-- sorry about that.  Try this Google Books link--it'll take you to a view of some of the pages in "Homeland" where Dr. Lahren discusses the Myers-Hindman site.<br />

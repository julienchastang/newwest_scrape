							I am obsessive about the organization of my book collection--I keep my bookshelves divided into alphabetized sections such as literature, travel, science, and art.  I subdivide the literature into country of origin of the writer, which leads to some judgment calls--for example, I put Oscar Wilde in the Irish literature section instead of the British because the Brits threw him in jail, which led to his demise, so Ireland gets credit for him, in my view.  When I heard about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.librarything.com" title="LibraryThing">LibraryThing</a>, an online book cataloguing site, you can bet all my obsessive-compulsive tendencies flared up.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.librarything.com" title="LibraryThing">LibraryThing</a> allows users to enter the books that they own or that they've been meaning to read, creating an online catalogue of their libraries.  You can also label your book collection with tags, add a star rating and a review, then search to determine who else shares your taste in books and get recommendations for future reading.  Cataloguing the first 200 books is free, and after that, it costs $10 a year or only $25 for a lifetime account.  It's great fun to play around with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.librarything.com" title="LibraryThing">LibraryThing</a>'s search tools, and lately I've been using it to search for Western reading material.<br />
<br />
A search of the tag "Montana" (used 235 times)  turns up a number of familiar and respected writers, including Ivan Doig, Judy Blunt, Rick Bass and Claire Davis.  The "New Mexico" tag (used 250 times) includes books by John Nichols and Willa Cather.  The "Colorado" tag has been used more often (338 times), but it's little less diverse--most people that use this tag are cataloguing their collection of Diana Mott Davidson mysteries, though a couple of other writers, such as Kent Haruf and Ralph Moody, turn up.  A search of the tag "American West" (used 474 times) turns up a number of interesting books, including Marc Reisner's <i>Cadillac Desert</i>, Theodore Roosevelt's <i>The Winning of the West</i>, and University of Colorado professor Patricia Limerick's <i>The Legacy of Conquest</i>.  No one else but me has used the tag "Interior West," and only one other person has used the tag "Rocky Mountain West."   The tag "West" is popular among readers of Don Coldsmith, who writes a series of historical fiction that features the Indians of the Great Plains.  The books most often tagged "Old West" include <i>Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West</i> by Dale L. Morgan, <i>Doc Holliday</i> by Jim Myers, and <i> Daughter of Fortune</i> by Isabel Allende.<br />
<br />
The beauty of LibraryThing is that the more people that use it, the more useful it becomes, so I am doing my part to add more "Western" and "Colorado" titles to my catalogue in the hopes that others will share their picks in these categories.

		<p>I love LibraryThing, too! I'm using it to track my "to read" list as well as things I've already read. Have you had any luck with the recommendations (based on what you've read, similar tags, or "special sauce")?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-25-06</b>
		<p>Thanks Jennifer.  So far, most of the recommendations that I'm getting are for other books I've already read and enjoyed but haven't yet entered into LibraryThing.  So I guess they're good recommendations since I've enjoyed those books, but it's not giving me many obscure suggestions--that's probably because these tools are based on the popularity of the titles.</p>

		<p>LibraryThing can be quite a useful tool for organization of your library, but for recommendations of obtuse titles and rare accounts of western topics, a good old low tech approach is often the best tool: contact your local independent bookseller!  We can recommend books that'll knock your spurs off and expand your horizons in ways that you'd never dreamed.----Margie Wilson, Grand Junction aka UpperCrustBooks</p>

		<p>A school is an institution where students learn from teachers; the word school can also refer to a building where such learning occurs. In most systems of formal education, students progress through a series of schools: primary school, secondary school, and possibly University or vocational school. A school may be also dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. In home schooling and online schools, teaching and learning take place outside of a traditional school building.<br />

Despite a 50 percent increase in per pupil spending over the past two decades, nearly one third of public high school students fail to graduate, and two thirds of all students leave high school unprepared for a four-year college, according to the Manhattan Institute. Given the diminishing economic prospects for Americans without a quality education, the need for reform is clear. <br />

		<p>I spent an age uploading my books onto &lt;a &gt;bookarmy&lt;/a&gt; and now i've just discovered LT! I'm wondering if there's a way of just transfering my lists over ( I doubt it, and i'll probably secretly enjoy uploading them all again anyway :D).</p>

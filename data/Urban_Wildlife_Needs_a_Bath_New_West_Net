							<p>Yesterday one of Boulder&#8217;s urban deer turned up outside our condo.&nbsp; She looked mangy, her winter coat coming off in clumps as she picked her way through the muddy drainage ditch.&nbsp; But to my nine-month-old, she looked like Bambi.&nbsp; My daughter stared at her in amazement, while I hoped that the animal wouldn&#8217;t get too close, carrying her ungulate pestilence.&nbsp; There are plenty of animals to be found outside our home these days&#8212;ducks, geese, deer, squirrels, and the occasional fox or heron.&nbsp; For some reason, these urban animals strike me as unsavory and unclean in a way their mountain-dwelling equivalents do not.
</p>
<p>
I remember that I used to like squirrels, or at least I didn&#8217;t mind them.&nbsp; Now they are adversaries, rooting through my outdoor planters looking for tulip bulbs that I no longer plant after years of relentless rodent attack.&nbsp; The only squirrels I can even tolerate any more are the little black ones that dart through the trees in alpine areas.
</p>
<p>
We often go visit the ducks in a pond off the bike path, which fascinates my baby, but the mallards have become too bold.&nbsp; So many people have fed them that you only have to make a vague gesture like you might have tossed a bit of bread for them to come waddling up.&nbsp; The one time I made the mistake of actually bringing crackers to lure them close, a green-headed mallard got so excited that he tasted my baby&#8217;s shoe.&nbsp; I&#8217;d seen this duck earlier, wallowing in a black sludgy morass.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t support the proliferation of anti-bacterial cleaning products, but I can tell you I was thankful I hadn&#8217;t been able to find a non-anti-bacterial hand soap at the grocery store as I scrubbed her shoe clean.
</p>
<p>
I am not hysterical about keeping my daughter away from dirt&#8212;in her outdoor explorations, she&#8217;s tasted bits of leaves, flowers, grass, dirt, and wood chips briefly.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s something about urban animals that seems extra dirty&#8212;it&#8217;s why pigeons are often despised in cities across the globe.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing wrong with pigeons inherently.&nbsp; My husband grew up in New York and Paris, cities plagued by befouled pigeons that often have missing or impaired body parts.&nbsp; He once did a double take at a flock of Denver pigeons.&nbsp; &#8220;The pigeons actually look clean here,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>
I know I shouldn&#8217;t begrudge canny animals that have managed to eke out an existence in urban areas despite development&#8217;s increasing encroachment.&nbsp; But it&#8217;d be nice if they&#8217;d all take a bath.

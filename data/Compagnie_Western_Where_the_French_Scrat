							When I'm traveling outside the Rocky Mountain area, I always try to detect other people's perceptions of our region.  Many Europeans seem to have an affinity for Western American and Native American culture. When my French penpal's family visited Denver many years ago, the first thing they wanted to do was see the Native American art collection at the Denver Art Museum, which they had read about.  Many of Denver's alt-country bands, including the now-defunct 16 Horsepower, boast a larger following in Europe than they do at home.  And Moab always seems to be jammed with German tourists. The Germans in particular seem to be enamored of Western landscapes—in New Mexico, I once saw a group of German tourists decked out in "Route 66" t-shirts and tight jeans with glinting belt buckles. Last week when I was visiting my French in-laws, my husband's aunt asked us if we could send her a catalogue featuring western vests of the sort that she had seen in a shop in DIA.<br />
<br />
In Paris last week, the city was covered with posters advertising  "Le Secret De Brokeback Mountain," the slightly more salacious-sounding title given to the Ang Lee film there.  I learned about a Paris store called <a href="http://www.compagniewestern.com/base.php?page=modules/page_generator/page.php&pgr_id=169" title="Compagnie Western">Compagnie Western</a> that seems to provide one-stop shopping for all Parisians afflicted with a love of the American West—it offers "Cinéma, Livres, Musiques, Images, Objets du Nouveau Monde et du Far West." Presumably "Far West" is what they call our neck of the woods, though the term suggests somewhere further out, maybe in the Pacific Ocean. <br />
<br />
The Compagnie Western is egalitarian in its approach—it sells CDs by alt-country and regular old country artists, including Johnny Cash, Garth Brooks, BR5-49, and even Colorado's Yonder Mountain String Band.  You can buy leather goods and holsters there, along with John Wayne DVDs, <i>Gunsmoke</i> items, calendars (including one called "The Montana Cowboy"), books on such topics as Cherokees, Western film, and cowboy songs.  I also came across something in the catalogue called "Nudie the Rodeo Trailer"—could this be cowboy porn for European consumption?<br />
<br />
It's clear that somewhere in Paris there's a desperado in leather chaps, watching <i>Red River</i> and singing along to Dolly Parton, just as somewhere in Colorado there's surely a woman wearing French perfume, listening to Edith Piaf, and dreaming of moving to Province.<br />

		<p>Jenny, I know exactly what you are talking about. My husband grew up in inner city Dublin, Ireland. The first time I went to meet my future in-laws they, knowing I was from "out-west", tried to make me feel comfortable by playing John Denver's Greatest Hits over and over and over...</p>

							A recent article in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> (Blake Eskin's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/books/review/26eskin.html?ex=1144468800&en=6c9ce4aa3c51d7c4&ei=5070" title=""Books To Chew On"">"Books To Chew On"</a>) highlighted the growing popularity of the production and consumption of edible books. A group of artists and bibliophiles at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmoca.org/" title="Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art">Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art</a> have been on the vanguard of this trend, and will celebrate the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eatyourwordsboulder.com/" title="7th International Edible Book Show & Tea">7th International Edible Book Show & Tea</a> this Sunday, April 9 at BMOCA from 4 to 6 p.m.  According to Eskin's article, "Judith A. Hoffberg, a California librarian, came up with the concept over Thanksgiving dinner back in 1999 and decided it would be best observed on April Fools' Day, which also turns out to be the birthday of the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, author of 'The Physiology of Taste' (1825). Hoffberg describes the festival as a low-key affair: 'From 2 to 4 p.m., one looks at the books, and takes photographs, and oohs and aahs. And at 4, you serve tea and serve the books.'<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookartsleague.org/" title="The Book Arts League">The Book Arts League</a>, a local non-profit dedicated to providing "a community resource for the book arts, particularly letterpress printing," began to sponsor an Edible Books Fair in Boulder in 2002, and the event has proved popular among people of all ages.  This year's festivities will include an offering of edible paper and markers that write in edible ink—participants will be encouraged to write something, then "eat their words."  Fair-goers will also have at their disposal a Jell-O printing press, a device that the Book Arts League described in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eatyourwordsboulder.com/press.htm" title="recent press release">recent press release</a>:<br />
<br />
"It’s a working hectograph that people can pull prints from. Sometime after 1870 a kitchen Gutenberg discovered it was possible to print using a tray of gelatin. During WW11 British POWs plotting to break out of the Colditz Castle melted their gelatin desserts and copied escape maps. And in Germany in 1914 emergency money to pay soldiers was produced by a hectograph. It has been used throughout history by missionaries, revolutionaries, artists, children and science fiction fans."<br />
<br />
The admission price of $4 for BMOCA members and $6 for non-members will help fund The Book Arts League's activities, as will a silent auction of edible books and gift certificates from local businesses. Attendees are encouraged to wear costumes "in the spirit of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party."<br />

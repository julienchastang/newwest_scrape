	My childhood memories of journeying to the library to use the encyclopedia for research papers seem like something from the long-ago past, even though the last time I did this was less than fifteen years ago.&nbsp; Is there any use for encyclopedias now that most factual questions are answerable through a few minutes of poking around on the Internet?&nbsp; The <I>Encyclopedia of the Great Plains Indians</I> offers an answer to that question: Encyclopedias can still provide a trove of information, especially when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you&#8217;re searching for.&nbsp; Through this book, for example, I learned about the complex marriage customs governing traditional Cheyenne society: 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Because of warfare,&#8221; entry author John H. Moore writes, &#8220;there were more women than men in Cheyenne society, so if possible a second sister was married to her older sister&#8217;s husband&#8230;If a man died, his brother was required to marry his widow&#8230;If a woman died, an unmarried sister was required to marry the widower&#8230;Modern Cheyenne women often &#8216;co-mother&#8217; their children, playfully calling the practice &#8216;Cheyenne health insurance.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The entries in this paperback volume are drawn from the larger <I>Encyclopedia of the Great Plains</I> that the University of Nebraska Press published in 2004.&nbsp; Each entry is written by an expert on the subject, and there are citations under each essay that provide good suggestions for further reading.
</p>
<p>
One could read the book in alphabetical order from the beginning, but I had more fun flipping from one entry to the next, seeing where they would lead me.&nbsp; In this way I learned that many places that are familiar to me in Colorado are considered sacred sites by various tribes.&nbsp; For example, Arapahos engaged in vision fasts to acquire &#8220;supernatural aid,&#8221; and &#8220;during the early nineteenth century, many of the men&#8217;s vision fasts were on various peaks in Estes Park, Colorado.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In the entry &#8220;Gender Roles&#8221; by the editor, David J. Wishart, I learned that many tribes engaged in social practices that would have been considered extremely progressive by contemporary European standards.&nbsp; For example, among the Omahas of Nebraska, &#8220;the senior wife&#8230;was the main decision maker.&nbsp; Women also had the right to divorce, and since they owned the lodge, an unkind husband could find himself homeless, with only his horse and weapons to his name.&#8221; Another fascinating aspect of the gender role question is the people who were known as &#8220;two-spirits&#8221; or &#8220;berdaches,&#8221; who &#8220;are best described as occupying an alternative or third gender role, in which traits of men and women are combined with those unique to berdache status,&#8221; according to Will Roscoe.&nbsp; He further writes, &#8220;Prominent warriors and chiefs, including the Omaha American Horse and the Lakota Crazy Horse, had berdaches among their wives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
In Allan Taylor&#8217;s fascinating entry on Sign Language, I learned that during the mid-nineteenth century, a Plains Sign Language flourished, which enabled members of different tribes with radically different spoken languages across the region to communicate with each other.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
My only criticism about <I>Encyclopedia of the Great Plains Indians</I> is that in a couple places, I found <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Churchill" title="Ward Churchill ">Ward Churchill </a>cited as a legitimate scholarly resource (such as in Akim D. Reinhardt&#8217;s entry on the American Indian Movement and Jacquelyn Kilpatrick&#8217;s &#8220;Hollywood Indians&#8221; essay).&nbsp; Although not all of Churchill&#8217;s writings have been discredited, enough have that scholars should look elsewhere to support their arguments.
</p>
<p>
The <I>Encyclopedia of the Great Plains Indians</I> is a wonderful resource for readers interested in learning more about the original inhabitants of the Great Plains, and should spur most to delve further into the topics that pique their interest.

		<p>"Although not all of Churchillâ€™s writings have been discredited, enough have that scholars should look elsewhere to support their arguments."<br />
<br />
Which articles by Churchill have been discredited?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-09-07</b>
		<p>Thanks for the question--here's a Wikipedia article on the various controversies surrounding Churchill:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWard_Churchill_misconduct_allegations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Churchill_misconduct_allegations</a><br />
<br />
As this explains, University of Colorado's standing Standing Committee on Research Misconduct investigated his writings and "found that he had falsified and fabricated information, and plagiarized two different essays."  This committee found that Churchill plagiarized three different authors, Annette Jaimes, Rebecca Robbins, and the authors of "The Water Plot," a pamphlet published by a group called Dam the Dams.<br />
<br />
The Rocky Mountain News also did some extensive investigation of Ward Churchill's career--the articles that resulted are too numerous to list here, but here's a link to one of the major ones:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainnews.com%2Fdrmn%2Flocal%2Farticle%2F0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_3841949%2C00.html">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_3841949,00.html</a><br />
<br />
Anyway, my quibble with citing his work in the Plains Indians Encyclopedia is that there are many far more reputable scholars that one could reference instead.  But this is just a minor note--it's a thoroughly fascinating book, and I hope to read more into the subject by checking out the books by many other authors that are cited.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 4-10-07</b>
		<p>Let me just second Jenny's point on Mr. Churchill while adding my own thoughts. This country suffers from a surplus of assertions that often take the form of fevered ramblings disassociated from evidence and decency. In the west, where the land still holds sway and challenges human arrogance, people have found it essential to be able to look each other in the eye and understand that we are bound by the integrity of our words and our actions. Scholarship, at its best and most essential, codifies that simple truth. Failed scholars like corrupt cops shake the foundations of our culture and cannot be tolerated. The literature of the west best reflects our hopes and dreams when it looks us in the eye and speaks truth. David Wishart and Bison Books have in their past work consistently illustrated the importance of good scholarship. Churchhill aside, I am hopeful this new work will continue their high standards.</p>

		<p>Whoaa..Anytime a writer can bring awareness to the customs and tradition of spiritual people I am all for. The way of spirit and some of its customs may not be what is of the norm for each individual..But the way of Spirit is Christ Way of teaching.<br />
Thanks Jenny for bring this book into the light!! <br />
Giddup..</p>

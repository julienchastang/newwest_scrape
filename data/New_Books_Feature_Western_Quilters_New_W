</p>
<p>
Jill started the website Quilts Over Kosovo, organized quilters to make large quilts and send them to the refugee camps, and &#8220;in just two weeks, 3,000 quilts were ready to be shipped&#8230;Within a month, Jill began spotting quilts she recognized in news footage of the refugee camps.&nbsp; Just as she&#8217;d imagined, they were being used as colorful tents.&#8221;  Quilts Over Kosovo ultimately shipped 10,000 quilts to the refugees.
</p>
<p>
Another group of Boise women formed The Boise Peace Quilt Project in 1981 at the height of the cold war with the intent to send a quilt from Idaho to a Soviet city of a similar size as a gesture of peace.&nbsp; Bell writes, &#8220;It took some diplomacy to keep the quilt out of a Leningrad museum, but the quilters persisted, and in the end it was displayed at the offices of the Soviet Women&#8217;s Peace Committee in Moscow and then, just as they had hoped, in a smaller city in Lithuania.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>Quilting for Peace</I> highlights many such stories of quilters moved to help others in need or to make a political statement with their work, and includes the instructions to make fifteen projects for the needy, such as a &#8220;Preemie Pinwheel Quilt&#8221; to comfort premature babies, the &#8220;30-Minute Shopping Bag&#8221; to cut down on plastic bag use, and the &#8220;Recycled Sleeping Bag&#8221; designed for use by homeless people.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As for Jill Kuraitis, she continues to help others through quilting whenever she can.&nbsp; For a time she taught simple quilting skills at a Boise mental hospital, and more recently she donated a sewing machine, cloth, and sewing supplies to a Somali immigrant family that she wrote about <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/city/article/thankful_for_thanksgiving_without_pirates/C108/L108/" title="in an article last year">in an article last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Annie Hanshew&#8217;s <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Border-Quilts-Quiltmakers-Montana/dp/0917298640" title="Border to Border: Historic Quilts and Quiltmakers of Montana">Border to Border: Historic Quilts and Quiltmakers of Montana</a></I></b> (Montana Historical Society Press, 223 pages, $24.95) gives a panoramic historical perspective on Montana&#8217;s quilters in this vividly illustrated book.&nbsp; Sparked by a renewed interest in the history of quilting, in 1987 the Quilters&#8217; Art Guild of the Northern Rockies began to register the quilts belonging to people in Montana.&nbsp; &#8220;Each region held documentation days during which trained volunteers examined and registered quilts of all ages and conditions,&#8221; Hanshew writes.&nbsp; The project has registered over 2,000 quilts in Montana, and many of the most interesting and unusual are featured in the book.
</p>
<p>
Each quilt in <I>Border to Border</I> is accompanied by the story of its origins.&nbsp; Many of the quilts migrated to Montana with their owners from other parts of the country.&nbsp; Quilts made before 1920 display a wide variety of designs, from an 1860 Laurel Leaf patterned quilt, to the red cross-spangled quilt created by the Cascade County Ladies Auxiliary to raise money for the Red Cross during World War I, to the Pineapple patterned quilt belonging to Alice Batchelder that has been passed down in her family since its creation in 1875.
</p>
<p>
Beginning in the 1920s and &#8216;30s, Hanshew writes, quilting books, patterns and kits became readily available and &#8220;the homogenizing trend in quiltmaking that had started at the turn of the century accelerated.&#8221;  Still, quilters continued to put their individual stamp on their creations.&nbsp; One striking example of this is Hilda Hill Snapp&#8217;s Western Storybook quilt, which includes scenes of pioneer, cowboy, and Indian life.&nbsp; Hill sewed the quilt in 1939, and pursued many other art forms: &#8220;She also played the piano, wrote, painted with oils and watercolors, worked in copper, tooled leather, knitted and crocheted.&#8221;  Her daughter-in-law says, &#8220;It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say she was one of the most talented women in central Montana.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>Border to Border</I> would make an ideal gift for anyone interested in quilts or the history of women in Montana.

		<b>Comment By Cindy Brick, 1-03-10</b>
		<p>Jenny, thank you for mentioning my book, QUILTS OF THE GOLDEN WEST. I loved researching into the history of America's Gold and Silver Rushes...and was amazed at how much our popular culture is reflected in the clothes we wear, the things we do, and the quilts we make. <br />
   Anyone interested in the book can find out more on the Brickworks website, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cindybrick.com">http://www.cindybrick.com</a> . It's also available on Amazon, and through the publisher, The Kansas City Star: <br />

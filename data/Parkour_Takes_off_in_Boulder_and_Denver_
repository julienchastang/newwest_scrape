		<h1>Parkour Takes off in Boulder and Denver</h1>

							<p>In the April 16 New Yorker, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Wilkinson" title="Alec Wilkinson">Alec Wilkinson</a> writes about parkour (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_wilkinson" title=""No Obstacles: Navigating the world by leaps and bounds"">&#8220;No Obstacles: Navigating the world by leaps and bounds&#8221;</a>), an athletic discipline invented by Frenchman <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=huv2sTalt7o" title="David Belle">David Belle</a>, involving the graceful and bold scaling of walls and the leaping of gaps in an urban setting.&nbsp; Although no American practitioner can rival Belle&#8217;s skills, Wilkinson&#8217;s source, Mark Tarook, who runs the website <a target="_blank" href="http://americanparkour.com/" title="AmericanParkour.com">AmericanParkour.com</a>, said that the best traceur (as parkour aficionados are called) is University of Colorado Sophomore Ryan Ford.

Wilkinson writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ford is five feet nine, and he weighs a hundred and forty-five pounds. His face is round, and his eyes are slightly slanted. He has Sioux and Navajo blood, and bristly dark-brown hair. Everyone in the Tribe has a nickname. Ford&#8217;s is Demon, but, being earnest and unassuming, he&#8217;s not very comfortable with it. He lives in an apartment in a rambling house with two roommates. We sat in the living room. Ford said that he discovered parkour on the Internet toward the end of his junior year in high school, in Golden, Colorado. He wanted to learn how to run up to a wall, plant his foot on it, and do a backflip. Looking for instructions, he found images of David Belle, among others. In the fall, he quit the football team, on which he was a wide receiver, to pursue parkour.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Wilkinson also talks with a 15-year-old traceur who is a current student at Boulder High.&nbsp; In addition to traveling to Paris to meet with David Belle, Wilkinson goes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.americanparkour.com/gallery2/v/jams/denver/" title="to Denver">to Denver</a> to hang out with the American parkour crew in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mapspotr.com/MapSpotr/index.html?locId=19" title="Skyline Park">Skyline Park</a>.&nbsp; In the eyes of traceurs, at least, Denver really is a &#8220;world class city.&#8221;  In the coming months, perhaps we can expect rangy daredevils from around the country to pour in and practice their skills.

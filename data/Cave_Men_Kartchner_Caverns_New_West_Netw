In 1974, two young spelunking buddies named Randy Tufts and Gary Tenen discovered an untouched cave in southern Arizona, filled with breathtaking formations like nothing they&#8217;d ever seen, so impressive and mysterious that they named it Xanadu.&nbsp; Then they did what any self-respecting cavers would do: they told no one about their discovery.&nbsp; Neil Miller&#8217;s engaging new book, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kartchner-Caverns-Discovered-Wonders-Natural/dp/0816525161/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208980218&amp;sr=8-1" title="Kartchner Caverns: How Two Cavers Discovered and Saved One of the Wonders of the Natural World">Kartchner Caverns: How Two Cavers Discovered and Saved One of the Wonders of the Natural World</a></I> follows Tufts and Tenen and the cave that would eventually become an Arizona State Park over a twenty year period in which the men try to determine how to safeguard Xanadu from vandals and eventually advocate it becoming a &#8220;show cave&#8221; in order to preserve and share it with others.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Tufts and Tenen located the cave through a sinkhole they found in the Whetstone mountains, a range not then frequented by area cavers, but possessing &#8220;all the geologic elements ideal for the formation of caves: limestone, natural faults, and water.&#8221;  Tufts had first noticed the sinkhole when he was in high school, seven years earlier, but back then he&#8217;d left it unexplored.&nbsp; In 1974, the two descended through a crack in the sinkhole, and found two small rooms, one with an eight-foot stalagmite.&nbsp; Then they saw a &#8220;grapefruit-sized hole&#8221; in the wall that let in enough air to blow out the flame of their carbide lamp.&nbsp; The men enlarged the hole slightly with a sledgehammer and a chisel until it became an entrance they called &#8220;the blowhole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a picture of Randy Tufts squeezing &#8220;the blowhole&#8221; that is almost unbelievable&#8212;the hole appears only large enough to accommodate his head and one shoulder, the rock squeezing him like a vise.&nbsp; Miller writes that the smaller Tenen &#8220;had been practicing navigating his way through narrow spaces by wiggling through his closet coat hangers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Once through the narrow entrance, rooms of wonders awaited Tufts and Tenen.&nbsp; They discovered it was a &#8220;wet&#8221; cave, still alive with stalactites and stalagmites being formed.&nbsp; They came back whenever they could to explore the cave, letting only a few trusted caving friends in on the secret.&nbsp; They discovered room after room of striking formations, including soda straws (a hollow mineral tube) longer than any in the U.S., striped &#8220;cave bacon&#8221; hanging from the ceiling, a formation that looks like a fried egg, and a 58-foot column they named the &#8220;Kubla Khan formation,&#8221; created when from a stalagmite meeting a stalactite.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I thought we were dreaming,&#8221; Miller quotes Tufts.&nbsp; &#8220;If we were to blink, it would all go away.&nbsp; You just realize that every gaze you cast on everything it was the first time that thing has ever been seen.&nbsp; It was almost as if you are bringing it into being just by looking at it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Tufts and Tenen were especially cautious and secretive because in the past, several of Arizona&#8217;s caves had been spoiled and vandalized, their formations stripped and their walls covered with graffiti.&nbsp; Secrecy is the code of many spelunkers, apparently.&nbsp; The two men belonged to a Tucson caving club, but Miller writes that at the group&#8217;s meetings, &#8220;It seemed as if hardly anyone wanted to talk to anyone about caves, at least not in a precise way that might reveal where a cave was located.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
When Tufts and Tenen realized what a remarkable cave they had discovered, they became passionate advocates for its preservation.&nbsp; After much deliberation, they decided the best way to preserve it was to try to turn it into a &#8220;show cave,&#8221; like Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico.&nbsp; This would prevent vandalism (as the cave, located close to a major highway, would be difficult to conceal forever) and allow other people to share their discovery.&nbsp; The first step was to speak with the owner of the land, a Mormon rancher with twelve children named James Kartchner.&nbsp; Miller conveys the tension of the situation perfectly&#8212;the reader is on the edge of his seat along with Tufts and Tenen as they wait to see how Kartchner will react to their presentation about the cave.&nbsp; Will he ban them from ever entering it again?
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the Kartchner family decides to form a partnership with Tufts and Tenen, and agree with the plan to try to turn the cave into a public one.&nbsp; But there are plenty more twists and turns in the road before the cave becomes a state park, which Miller conveys with suspense and clarity.&nbsp; At one point, a park official visits the cave, and Tufts and Tenen insist be blindfolded on the way there in order to preserve the secrecy of the location.&nbsp; Eventually dozens of officials and even Arizona&#8217;s governor visit.&nbsp; Tufts and Tenen assume aliases as they travel around the country researching other show caves.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Xanadu eventually makes enough allies in government to receive its own funding bill, which retains the secrecy of the location and doesn&#8217;t even mention that a cave is involved.&nbsp; Sympathetic congressmen sneak the bill through during the impeachment of Governor Evan Mecham.&nbsp; But there&#8217;s still more work ahead: Miller chronicles the painstaking process of making the cave accessible to the public while avoiding damaging, contaminating, or drying it.&nbsp; The construction crew charts new territory, as it was the first show cave built with attention to environmental concerns.
</p>
<p>
<I>Kartchner Caverns</i> is a fascinating story, full of striking personalities, all the way through to its bittersweet ending.&nbsp; This book will bring the world of caves vividly alive to even the most claustrophobic reader.

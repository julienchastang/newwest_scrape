	Montana&#8217;s Yaak Valley has a small population but has become well known to thousands of readers through the books of Rick Bass, its eloquent, longtime resident.&nbsp; In her appealing memoir <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Looks-Going-Doris-Knowles-Pulis/dp/1606390104/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1273351697&amp;sr=8-2" title="How it Looks Going Back">How it Looks Going Back</a></I>, Doris Knowles Pulis offers another perspective on the Yaak, from her vantage as a girl growing up there beginning in 1949, when she was in third grade.&nbsp; Comparing Pulis&#8217;s stories to Bass&#8217;s recent account of his family&#8217;s life in the Yaak, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/dad_in_the_woods_rick_basss_the_wild_marsh/C39/L39/" title="The Wild Marsh: Four Seasons At Home in Montana">The Wild Marsh: Four Seasons At Home in Montana</a></I>, it&#8217;s clear that being a kid in the Yaak hasn&#8217;t changed much in sixty years: In good weather, the kids spend most of their time outside, they learn how to fish and hunt, immerse themselves in nature, and there are always plenty of chores to do, especially the endless task of putting up firewood and other supplies for the long winter.
</p>
<p>
	In 1949, Darwin and Marilyn Knowles took their kids, Doris, known as Dee, and three-year-old Barbara, known as Bob, camping in British Columbia.&nbsp; Marilyn and Dar Knowles are fishing fanatics, and when Dar hears about the Yaak River in Montana, he decides he wants to fish there on the way home.&nbsp; While in the Yaak, Dar finds a cabin next to a lake for sale, and he and his wife decide to leave the family&#8217;s successful car dealership in San Diego behind and move to Montana.
</p>
<p>
	Pulis explains &#8220;what got into them&#8221; to make such a radical change.&nbsp; &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it,&#8221; Pulis writes, &#8220;I was one reason we moved to Montana.&nbsp; I was a scrawny kid and wouldn&#8217;t thrive.&nbsp; My little sister was bouncing with health but I saddled my parents with a chronic worry.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t eat and had dark circles under my eyes.&nbsp; During polio season&#8212;all summer&#8212;my parents were told to keep me indoors, away from other kids.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Marilyn and Darwin Knowles are winning characters in Pulis&#8217;s portrayal.&nbsp; Marilyn has &#8220;a reckless streak and the heart of a gypsy,&#8221; and Darwin &#8220;thought a man mustn&#8217;t let the pursuit of wealth take over his life.&#8221;  So the decision is made, and the family packs up its belongings in San Diego and moves into the cabin with no running water or electricity, up the road from the &#8220;&#8216;town&#8217; of Yaak&#8221; which &#8220;consisted altogether of Icie Betzer&#8217;s post office/gas station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	The Knowles&#8217; first weeks in the cabin feel like an extended summer vacation, as Marilyn tries to master cooking on the wood stove, Darwin sets up a workable outhouse and water pump, and Dee starts attending the one-room Yaak school, where she is the only girl of the three kids in her grade.&nbsp; &#8220;At recess, when I listened to all the kids talking,&#8221; Pulis recalls, &#8220;they sounded tough and careless and I felt out of place and too citified compared to them.&#8221;  They hike in the woods and cook dinner over campfires, &#8220;high on excitement and the novelty of the place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	But then the Knowles&#8217; concerned German-Swiss neighbors, the Binders, clue them in on how much preparation they&#8217;ll need to survive a winter in the Yaak, and they set to work splitting and storing massive piles of wood, ordering provisions to last the winter, and finding some winter clothes.&nbsp; The Binders help them with their tasks: one day they walk into their kitchen, &#8220;and there, draped completely across our kitchen table in gory glory, was a dressed-out deer, ready to hang in the cooler.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Winters are novel for the California Knowles at first, but leave them weary by the end.&nbsp; The roads are frequently impassable, so Dee misses a lot of school, and the cold is too intense for the girls to play outside for long.&nbsp; But as she passes several years in the Yaak, Dee grows strong and confident, learns to ride a horse, embarks on lengthy hiking trips without adults, splits wood, and practices until she can swim the whole way across their lake.
</p>
<p>
	Pulis shares several funny stories about the Knowles&#8217; interactions with their neighbors, such as her pro-science father&#8217;s long theological arguments with the Reverend McCoy, a local Seventh-day Adventist who makes it his mission to convert Darwin away from his belief in evolution.&nbsp; &#8220;Both men were drawn to the feud like magnets,&#8221; Pulis writes.&nbsp; When there&#8217;s talk that someone wants to open a saloon in the Yaak, McCoy speaks out adamantly against it, which is why, when it opens, everyone calls the bar <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_not_so_dirty_shame_saloon/C41/L41/" title="The Dirty Shame Saloon">The Dirty Shame Saloon</a>, the name it still holds today.
</p>
<p>
	Marilyn has her own feud with Alma Phillips, the woman whom she displaces as the best cook in the Yaak.&nbsp; When Marilyn&#8217;s dishes at community hall suppers earn the most raves, Alma plots her revenge, sabotaging Marilyn&#8217;s food, and Marilyn retaliates by secretly throwing all of Alma&#8217;s chicken into the fire.
</p>
<p>
	When Pulis reaches the age to attend high school, her mom observes that she&#8217;s getting &#8220;rough around the edges,&#8221; and rather than send her to boarding school, the Knowles family leaves the Yaak together.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s clear that the six years Pulis spent in the Yaak were the formative ones of her childhood, and she recalls them with a clarity and good humor that makes <I>How it Looks Going Back</I> a pleasure to read.

		<p>I spent 5 years in the Yaak 1967-72 and met many of the folks that Ms. Pulis describes in her book.  From my memory, she is "right on". I would like her e.mail address as I think we have a lot to share.  While I arrived several years after she left and was the last "Upper Ford Ranger", my son was only 9 days old when we arrived at our Forest Service "cabin". We experienced 50 below temperatures and some exciting times with terrible forest fires.  What meant the most to me were the very interesting folks that lived there; our get togethers at the Yaak Community Hall and just the every day living and working in a very primitive environment.  After a 37 year career, my best memories are of the Upper Yaak</p>

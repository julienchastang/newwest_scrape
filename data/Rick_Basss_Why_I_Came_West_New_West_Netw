<p>
	Rick Bass&#8217; new book <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-I-Came-West-Memoir/dp/0618596755" title="Why I Came West">Why I Came West</a></I> is subtitled &#8220;A Memoir,&#8221; but it&#8217;s more of a cri de coeur.&nbsp; Bass spends a few pages discussing his life, explaining how he came to move to the remote Yaak Valley of northwest Montana after growing up in Houston, and devotes the rest of the book to a philosophical reflection on twenty years spent as an environmental activist.&nbsp; His goal, simply put, is that he wants &#8220;the last roadless lands in the Yaak Valley to be designated as wilderness.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Although he thought this was a fairly modest aim when his quest began, he met vehement opposition or indifference from his neighbors, logging interests, and politicians.&nbsp; Bass never could have predicted the course his life would take when he left his job as a petroleum geologist in Mississippi and drove with his eventual wife west and north until they hit his &#8220;beloved supple landscape with its velvet folds and curves,&#8221; a valley in which no species has gone extinct since the last ice age.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As Bass writes, this is &#8220;a story of love,&#8221; and so he&#8217;s never given up despite what it&#8217;s cost him.&nbsp; He has been ostracized and threatened in his small community of around a hundred people (a burden his wife and daughters share) and has spent so much time in committee meetings and strategy sessions that he fears he&#8217;s lost many good years that he could have spent producing fiction.&nbsp; Although he just published a terrific collection two years ago, Bass writes of &#8220;the ghost of one of my old lives, which was short story writing&#8212;the ghost I try always to keep near and hope soon to reinhabit.&#8221;  This aspect of <I>Why I Came West</I> is a little dispiriting for fans of Bass&#8217;s fiction, but when you glance at the list of books he&#8217;s published&#8212;almost two dozen, an enviable output for any writer&#8212;you get the idea that maybe he&#8217;s lost less than he imagines.
</p>
<p>
Bass makes a convincing case that he&#8217;s not the sort of wild-eyed environmentalist that his detractors demonize him as.&nbsp; He&#8217;s an avid hunter, spending several months a year shooting the meat to feed his family for the coming year.&nbsp; And he soon realized that in order to reach his goal of preserving the remaining roadless areas, he had to incorporate the desires of his neighbors.&nbsp; To that end, he&#8217;s worked to keep small local timber mills open and applied for grants that would allow the cutting of selected trees (useful for fire mitigation and as a source of wood for people who make their living from timber).&nbsp; Bass acknowledges that the Yaak Valley isn&#8217;t an easy place to earn a living, and he understands his neighbors&#8217; fears of losing their livelihoods if access to trees is restricted.&nbsp; Still, he no longer visits the local bar after too many altercations, and is frequently attacked in the town paper.&nbsp; Although Bass praises many people who he has met through his activism, you get the idea that he would agree with Sartre&#8217;s belief that hell is other people.
</p>
<p>
I consider Rick Bass an uncommonly successful person&#8212;he&#8217;s certainly one of the most respected and admired writers of the Rocky Mountain region, if not the entire country.&nbsp; It was surprising then, to read Bass&#8217;s account of what he considers his many failures, chief among them his failure to secure the wilderness designation for the Yaak Valley after decades of Sisyphean struggle.
</p>
<p>
I kept thinking of Barbara Kingsolver&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/kingsolvers_quest_animal_vegetable_miracle/C132/L39/" title="Animal, Vegetable, Miracle">Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</a></I> as I read <I>Why I Came West</I>.&nbsp; Both Bass and Kingsolver are accomplished fiction writers and passionate environmentalists, and both have, at times, let their political views slip into their fiction, but for the most part have managed to focus on telling a story as their primary goal (which is why they&#8217;ve won so many fans and accolades).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
And both Bass and Kingsolver have taken personal action to right what they see is wrong with the world.&nbsp; Kingsolver&#8217;s abhorrence for foods laden with pesticides and antibiotics that are shipped long distances led her to move from Arizona to Virginia and raise much of the food she ate.&nbsp; And Bass&#8217;s desire to preserve unblemished wilderness led him to spend big chunks of time writing letters to politicians, crafting op-ed pieces, and sitting in endless committee meetings.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Kingsolver&#8217;s account of her quest was buoyant&#8212;she seemed freed by being able to write about the issues that she cares about most passionately, and did so with good humor and cheer.&nbsp; Bass&#8217;s book, by contrast, is a lamentation.&nbsp; His assessment of irrevocable environmental losses might be accurate, but his vision is frighteningly apocalyptic.&nbsp; He writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And when the bleeding is all done and the oil is all gone&#8212;not just the peak oil, but all the oil, down to the last drop&#8212;and we lie buried beneath our history, still waiting for some greater salvation or redemption to ignite us&#8230;even then, another temptation will reside beneath us and around us: if not the fluid supple allure of oil, then the densely compacted chitin of coal, the old dirty brown Paleozoic swamps, each lithified like a charred heart into brittlecake seams of strata&#8212;ten thousand years&#8217; worth of such brittlecake.&nbsp; And I fear that it will be the easiest thing in the world then to simply remain buried in this land of the fossil fuels, and to continue gnawing at the coal, worsening our problem tenfold with every sulfurous exhalation, and with the now acidic celestial dome or dark curtain above raining sulphuric hail, mercuric tempest, brimstone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
So I guess it&#8217;s time to get into the anti-brimstone umbrella business.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s a welcome shift toward optimism at the end of <I>Why I Came West</I> that begins with Bass&#8217;s hilarious stories of the times he&#8217;s been the victim of pepper spray meant to ward off bear attacks, and continues with Bass&#8217;s explanation of a careful plan he and his compatriots have forged, a plan he thinks just might succeed in finally designating some of the Yaak as wilderness.&nbsp; I, for one, wish Bass the best of luck with his goals, which he has addressed with what he calls &#8220;engagement and the passion of desire&#8221; throughout his adult life.&nbsp; I hope he achieves them soon, and heads back with some sense of peace to his writing desk.

		<p>Bass's largest failing has been his pandering for support from outside Montana. His books primarily sell elsewhere. His New York Times paeans are read by people with no first-hand knowledge of the area or the community. And he has the arrogance to feel that only HE can fully appreciate the Yaak and the proles will never understand, that only his "solutions" are true and correct. I mean, I read an essay once where he claimed the Yaak as "my valley." What? Should we rename the Yaak River the Rick River?<br />
I am always stunned by people who scream and yell about "community solutions" while themselves utterly failing to integrate themselves into that community.<br />
Whatever. I'll be checking the book out at some point, it's always useful to understand the mind of one's en --- um, advers--- er, ah, um, OPPONENTS.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Garth Whitson, 7-21-08</b>
		<p>Oh, Dave, I didn't know you had access to all the demographics with regard to sales of Rick Bass books. Do you work for Houghton Mifflin? Are you the statistical guy for them? What an interesting job that must be for you.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Monty, 7-21-08</b>
		<p>Attack, attack, attack!  The environmental point of view is increasingly marginalized with self-rightous indignation and stone cold ignorance or denial. One can speak about a human disease epidemic and not be critized but when one speaks about the "ecological holacaust", that is a product of our pathogical consumption rates, then beware!<br />
<br />
The natural resources of this country have been "mined" for 200 years without a thought for sustainability.  Our soils are thinner, water is over drafted and the air is less pure while promoting the "mirage" that our use of non-renewable resources is sustainable.  In spite of living in the most "charitable" plot of land on earth (the lower 48), our extraction industries must now go to the "ends of the earth" to mine more non-renewable resources in order to sustain our non-renewable live style for a few more decades.<br />
<br />
Who are the extemists in this enviromental war, those like Rick Bass, who argue for moderation and restraint and conservation, or those, who live under the dead weight of ignorance, forgiving and protecting the extraction corporations who exhaust, pollute and leave local communities "holding the bag".  Individual environmental extremists who burn vehicles or buildings are punished for their crimes-as they should be--but corporations, who commit crimes on a grander scale  are rarely punished--did anyone serve a day in jail for the "Cancer epidemic" that the citizens of Libby, Montana are contending with?  What about all of the "Super Fund" cleanup sites that the America tax payer is paying for while the corporations keep the wealth and laugh all the way to the bank?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 7-21-08</b>
		<p>Garth,<br />
Perhaps as a bookseller you can enlighten us all on precisely where Rick's books sell and to whom. Fine and dandy, but it's likely that he won't make the Yaak bestseller list any time soon.<br />
And Monty, I sort of agree with you about corporate America. They don't have ethics, they have interests. What scares me about corporations is that they can live forever, don't pay inheritance taxes, in other words, pretty much immortal. So they'll never wind up in hell like their employees, and a bunch of us, will.<br />
However, I must point out a couple things here. Rick adheres to the POV that others should moderate THEIR lives. His, of course, is perfect. Is your life perfect, too?<br />
Second, Rick has always been an activist. I do not doubt his passion. I envy his ability to paint word-pictures. But his pictures are distortive...kinda like Picassos or Dalis.<br />
Always remember when reading Rick that he is first and foremost a fiction writer -- a creature of his own mind. A great imagination does not guarantee a firm grasp on reality. It may mean great literature, great art, but not necessarily a great Northwest.</p>

I don't *know* where Rick Bass's books sell and to whom. I'm not the one posing as an expert on Rick Bass. But I will always remember when reading your comments that you are a creature of your own mind. Of course. Aren't we all.<br />
Cordially, Garth Whitson, the non-statistical bookseller</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Monty, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Dave Skinner:  no one's life is perfect, all must live in the "context" of our culture.  But that doesn't mean that environmental issues should be ignored. Prior to the infamous Ohio river that caught on fire, there were probable a few environmental "radicals" who were attempting to "alert" the public about this ongoing industrial crime and were ignored until the "river burned".</p>
		
		<b>Comment By New York Times Paean, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Wow Dave, I didn't know Rick Bass had the perfect life. Amazing.  I sure wish he would spend less time writing phenomenal prose, handing the world incredible stories, advocating for wilderness and resource conservation, and more time passing out the recipe for something that huge. Thanks for sharing this bit of insider Bass-ness.  Next time I attend a reading or lecture I'm definitely going to ask him how I too can get the perfect life.<br />
<br />
If you've never developed an intimate relationship with a landscape, learned the many components and rhythms there-in, including the community of people residing there, then I completely understand that you would be put off by someone declaring it "mine." Once you have, its an absolutely perfect description and is far from arrogant selfishness, but representative of a deep connection to place. Then again, I too am a creature of my own mind (how is anyone not?) and read Bass through this filter.<br />
 <br />
Finally, thanks for the new moniker.  Love it. And yes, you can read the New York Times AND live in Montana.  Go figure.  I even have first-hand knowledge of the Yaak Valley, the dense alder hell that it is. It's a beautiful, wild and hard, hard place (on so many levels).</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Good comeback, Garth. I should know better than to war words with the literati.<br />
NYTP raises something, tho. I really have no desire to go to readings, especially of bizarre navel-gazings, although a conceptual lecture can be all right. After all, writing, and reading for that matter, are inherently solitary experiences. Are readings a liberal thing, for those who think in groups? <br />
Then comes the worst part of this literariness. How do you reduce a landscape to words? Really, seriously. Trying to do so reduces it to those who know it best, and further implicitly know that words fail. <br />
Utterly.</p>

Oh, yes. Why bother even trying? Those silly authors, always trying to reduce great things to mere words.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Jenny, I think Kingsolver was a long time resident of Tucson Arizona. <br />
As for "letting their political views slip into their fiction," I fail to see why that would necessarily be a negative (sorry if I'm misreading your point). Politics is simply how we organize ourselves. It is right and honorable, to embrace honest politics as our duty to our land and our people. Beyond the shear power and beauty of his storytelling, the reason I respect Bass, arrogant bastard that he may be (of course I don't know this for a fact having never met the man...Dave have you?), is because the broad outline of his life (again I don't know him personally) and work indicates honor and honesty. Virtues often in short supply in our public discourse.<br />
Finally, as for reducing a landscape to words...Holy hell words fail me.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
You are right--Kingsolver is from Arizona, of course.  Sorry about that mistake.  I've changed it in the article.<br />
<br />
As for politics and fiction--I think it's admirable when a writer's politics influences their choice of subject matter.  That usually makes for meaningful work.  What I don't like is when a fiction writer uses their characters in a way that seems more geared to driving home a political point rather than serving the story at hand.  I think both Bass and Kingsolver do a good job of avoiding this, given how passionate they are about their beliefs, except very occasionally, such as in one chapter I recall near the end of Kingsolver's excellent "The Poisonwood Bible" that I felt was preachy, and one story in Bass's last collection, called "Fiber," that I felt didn't work as fiction.  (You can read what I wrote about that here, if you like:<br />

		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 7-22-08</b>
		<p>Jenny,<br />
Poisonwood Bible is a favorite of mine, however; I have always thought that the story loses some of its grace and power toward its conclusion. I always thought it was mostly because of the dramatic shift in time and space. But, you make a great point. <br />
I read your review earlier (the book section is always my first stop at New West). The two stories of Jyl (who joins Dalva as my favorite female characters written by male writers) are as strong and moving as anything Bass has ever written and are exhibit A as to my point about Bass and honor and honesty and, let me add, dignity. As for "Fiber," well, I enjoy a good rant every now and again. In the hands of master, it can be a powerful experience. Better, even, than the readers comments here at New West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By steve kelly, 7-24-08</b>
		<p>Bass has never supported, multi-state, ecosystem-based wilderness legislation.  A more effective writer, better Democrat than activist.  Local bullies tend to harrass those who give ground.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Steve Stuebner, 7-25-08</b>
		<p>While an official "wilderness" designation might be best for the Yaak country, I have felt that once Clinton shut down the subsidized logging gravy train that had turned our national forests into timber factories for decades, the major threat to the millions of acres of roadless lands in Montana and Idaho had suddenly been eliminated. <br />
<br />
Nowadays, the Forest Service spends most of its time fighting fires and trying to control ATVs. Roadless areas, at least for the moment, may not be capital W wilderness, but in reality, they are absolutely as wild, if not more so, than an official Wilderness, because fewer people know about them or use them, and the trails don't get much attention. <br />
<br />
However, if there are oil and gas resources underneath a roadless area, then that would be another reason to get the full wilderness protection. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, some of my backpacking friends and I are not all that anxious to see our favorite roadless areas turned into a capital W wilderness because then the national spotlight is trained on them and they receive more public use, etc.</p>

		<p>"How do you reduce a landscape to words? Really, seriously. Trying to do so reduces it to those who know it best, and further implicitly know that words fail. <br />
Utterly."<br />
<br />
Interesting. I've always thought you could better describe a landscape through words better than just about any other medium. Images are always bounded, and only capture a given point in time. Sound can't convey the three-dimensional depth and breadth of a landscape except in a linear fashion. Video, again, bound by a frame and time, (though less so than an image). <br />
<br />
Words can portray, to a astute reader, precise visual, tactile and impressionistic detail ("the bare, black, basalt dome was 300 feet high, shaped like half a cantaloupe, and shimmered in the mid-afternoon sun") and can express that portrait as a snapshot in time, or as an encapsulation of changes (or no changes) over a period of time. Spoken words, given inflection and a syncopated delivery, can create additonal meaning not apparent on paper.<br />
<br />
The thing about readings is not the words, it's how an author says the words. Listening to Dylan Thomas read one of his poems is very different from reading the poem in your own voice. "Readings" are about people and the life in the words, not the words in themselves. "Readings" aren't necessarily for literati, they're more for people interested in how other people percieve and express their world.<br />
<br />
I can understand the comfort of solipcism: there are no challenges to one's own beliefs. But it doesn't provide much protection from reality. <br />
<br />
I don't know Rick Bass, but it sounds like the folks in the bar where he doesn't feel comfortable drinking need a good ass kicking to teach them to be more polite to their fellow citizens.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 7-27-08</b>
		<p>Captain, you miss the point.<br />
Blab all you want, snap all you want, record all you want, but its nothing like being there with all five senses. There you have, yep, reality from which no protection is needed, no description needed, no translation either required or appropriate.<br />
Let me describe in words:<br />
Nice sunset. Fence. Rancher friend. Post-supper coffee in hand, lean on fence with rancher for about the duration. Ponder. Look at cows, mountains, grass. Smell associated smells, hear associated sounds. Sunset over. "Good one." "Yep." Go in house, play cards.<br />
It's been said that people are shaped by where they're from. Rick's not from the Yaak. Period.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 7-28-08</b>
		<p>Geez Skinner don't think I'll buy your book. As for the accident of place of birth, are you telling me that someone born at the foot of the Winds shapes them (what? what is it you're saying?),we'll go with better, than someone who has wandered every inch of those mountains most of their adult life. "It's been said" that that is a load of horse crap. "Period."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By jedediah Redman, 1-28-09</b>
		<p>According to Skinner's <i>world view</i> Bass is not a <u>Montanan</u>...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Peej McBean, 10-23-09</b>
		<p>I know Bass and a major problem he has with his fellow Yaakers is that he uses poetic license when writing about the Yaak - his dog Colter was a chicken killer but Bass portrays his death as an anti-environmental payback  - a fellow environmentalists car gets burnt up by a nutcase that arrived the day before and the event is turned into a payback - nothing is ever said about all the people who got out of bed in the middle of the night to fight the fire - Most Yaakers just wish that he would get all of his "facts" right before he writes - and label fiction as fiction not essays</p>

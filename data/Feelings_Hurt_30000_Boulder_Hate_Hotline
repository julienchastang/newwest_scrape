		<h1>Feelings Hurt?&nbsp; $30,000 Boulder “Hate Hotline” Wants to Know</h1>

							One popular description of Boulder by those who live outside it is “25 square miles surrounded by reality.”  Because I grew up in Denver, I learned first hand that Boulder is frequently the butt of jokes made by other Colorado residents, so another catchy phrase to describe the town might be “25 square miles surrounded by 10400 square miles of people making fun of it.”  And Boulder keeps giving the rest of Colorado plenty of reason to laugh: Bill Scanlon reported in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4689595,00.html" title="<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>"><i>Rocky Mountain News</i></a> today that the Boulder City Council is taking some heat for its proposal to spend $30,000 on setting up a “hotline, which would give residents a place to report incidents in which people are treating others insensitively, based on their race, gender, sexual orientation or other differences.”  <br />
<br />
What about people treating others insensitively on the basis of their Boulder residency?  If so, someone should have reported me long ago, as I have often laughed at middle-aged amateur cyclists dressed in full professional gear zipping around on $4000 bicycles.<br />
<br />
The hotline idea was prompted by a serious incident last June in which a Hispanic man assaulted a black man while shouting racial slurs at him.  A few months ago, the assailant, Phillip Martinez, was sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison, though the jury decided to drop the “ethnic intimidation” charges.  The victim, Andrew Sterling, was pleased with the result, telling the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4508248,00.html" title="<i>Rocky Mountain News</i>"><i>Rocky Mountain News</i></a>, “The fact that he broke my face is more important than that he hurt my feelings."<br />
<br />
But leave it to the Boulder City Council to try to improve the town’s image as a tolerant place by setting up an inane and costly hotline for people to report when their feelings have been hurt.  Because Sterling was verbally harassed and assaulted within the space of a few seconds, there would have been no time for him to call the hotline—if there had been time, he’d have better spent it calling the police.  As Scanlon writes in a paragraph that I can only read as deadpan humor: “A recent incident that contributed to the discussion on whether Boulder needs a hate hotline involved a Hispanic man who punched a black University of Colorado student after racial slurs were used. But skeptics point out that the man was from Lafayette, and drunk, which says little about whether Boulder needs a hotline to report racism.”  Or maybe it just suggests that nearby Lafayette needs a hotline of its own.  Or that drunken Lafayette residents should be turned back at Boulder city limits.<br />
<br />
Scanlon quotes City Councilman Richard Polk expressing his views on the importance of being sensitive to people’s feelings: "We interviewed at-risk youths and heard this echo that, yes, there is a problem.  Not a terrible problem like people are physically hurting each other, but certainly they're emotionally hurting each other.”  <br />
<br />
Richard Polk is a girly man.  Well, I really don’t know much about the guy, but on the basis of that statement, I though he could use a little toughening up.  So report me, Polk, I dare you.<br />
<br />
As Jack Handy once said, "It takes a big man to cry.  But it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man."

		<p>Ooh ooh...I love to laugh at the hippies playing drums and at the unique prestige that comes from using the word "process" as many times in one conversation as possible.<br />
There's so much to laugh at here!<br />
True story: yesterday I overhead a woman respond to a question with the following: "I'm not angry.  It's my energy telling my self to be angry when my truth is that I'm not really angry."<br />

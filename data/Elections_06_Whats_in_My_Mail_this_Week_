							For the past few months, I've been in the habit of stopping at the recycling bin on my way from the mailbox before I reach my front door and ditching the piles of election advertisements.  But this week I kept the glossy brochures and postcards and studied them.  What I enjoy most about my election mail are the Photo-Shopped pictures of the candidates.  The graphic designers employed by the campaigns are clearly having fun.  One graphic designer I worked with at an alternative weekly complained to me, "I spent two years in art school and all I end up making is beer and bong art."  So much more fun for the designer, I'm certain, was the image of Bob Beauprez in a cannibal's pot.<br />
<br />
My favorite has to be the oversized postcard marked "paid for by Coloradans for Fairness."  This group backs Referendum I, which would allow for domestic partnerships for same-sex couples.  The photo on the front bears the caption, "This is marriage," and features the most white bread wedding party imaginable, apparently in an effort to appeal to conservatives.  The bride wears white, the bridesmaids are a blonde and a redhead, and the men look like toothpaste models.  Not only is nobody ethnic, no one is even swarthy.  And the mother of the bride sports a wide-brimmed white hat and looks a lot like Mrs. Brady.  The image is so wholesome, it's almost campy.  Which must be the opposite of the intent.<br />
<br />
Colorado gubernatorial candidate  Bob Beauprez takes a beating in my mail this week.  Perhaps no pro-Beauprez materials make it through the Boulder County mail.  In one postcard, Beauprez sits in a cannibal's pot, in "hot water" over the FBI probe.  In another, formatted to look like a supermarket tabloid, he's called Bob 'The Tax Man" Beauprez, and the photos of him are altered to look blurry, or chosen because he looks angry or defensive in them.  In another brochure, he's caricatured as the Cheshire cat <i>and</i> Alice in Wonderland, wearing a blue dress with white pinafore.  There's also a grainy photo of him pointing in two different directions at once--I can't be sure, but it looks Photo-Shopped.<br />
<br />
But so what if it isn't.  Do people really cast their votes based on which candidate looks squintier or shiftier in photos?  I mean, as long as they aren't windsurfing.  Because those windsurfing guys are totally evil.<br />

		<p>I wish just once these mailings would include a simple list of what the candidates actually support. That being said - I am *really* enjoying the Angie Paccione vs. Marilyn Musgrave ad war. It gets more entertaining every passing day.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bob Wire, 11-03-06</b>
		<p>Thanks for the laughs this morning, Jenny. As a graphic designer, I can relateâ€”I've even coined a term for us artists who occasionally must abandon our esthetic in favor of filthy lucre: whoretists.<br />
I laid out a brochure for a candidate for Missoula's City Council a few years back, and he called several times to tell me about all the compliments he received on it. He won the election by three votes, and turned out to be a mean-spirited, conservative prick. After that I decided that I'd better pay closer attention to who my clients are!</p>

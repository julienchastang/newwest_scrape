							<p>Best-selling Boulder author Jon Krakauer has withdrawn the manuscript for <I>Hero</I>, his book about Pat Tillman, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6573003.html" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a> (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slushpile.net/index.php/2008/06/25/krakauer-withdraws-tillman-book/" title="Slushpile.Net">Slushpile.Net</a>). Rachel Deahl writes that Doubleday had scheduled the book for an October release with a first printing of half a million copies.&nbsp; Deahl reports:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Krakauer is apparently unhappy with the manuscript and is holding onto it indefinitely. David Drake at Doubleday confirmed that the decision was entirely the author&#8217;s and that, while the imprint is &#8216;disappointed,&#8217; it supports its author. Speaking to the book&#8217;s future, Drake said the situation is &#8216;a little bit wait and see&#8217; and that if the book does get rescheduled it likely wouldn&#8217;t come out until at least 2009.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Although Krakauer fans expecting a juicy fall read might be disappointed, I bet that this delay can only be a good thing for the eventual book.

Denise Hill at the always informative <a target="_blank" href="http://newpagesblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/interview-cutbank-in-bangledesh.html" title="NewPages blog">NewPages blog</a> pointed out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2008/06/01/interview.htm" title="Ahmede Hussain's interview with Brian Kevin">Ahmede Hussain&#8217;s interview with Brian Kevin</a>, Managing Editor of the University of Montana&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cutbankonline.org/" title="CutBank">CutBank</a>.&nbsp; The interview ran in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailystar.net" title="The Daily Star">The Daily Star</a>, which Hill says is &#8220;Bangladesh&#8217;s largest circulating English-language newspaper.&#8221;  And according to Hussain, CutBank is &#8220;America&#8217;s foremost literary magazine.&#8221;  Sweet!&nbsp; That means that I can go around saying that one of my short stories was published in America&#8217;s foremost literary magazine.&nbsp; (I&#8217;m sure my two-year-old will be very impressed.)  
</p>
<p>
Brian Kevin discussed, among other topics, CutBank&#8217;s gently regional approach: 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve embraced a very slight regional bias in the last few years, and that&#8217;s an okay thing, too. The American West is still a distinct literary zone, and though I think the writing we publish is a little too unorthodox to really come out of the saloon doors wearing cowboy boots and a Stetson, I like the idea that you can flip through the magazine and, if you&#8217;re listening very closely, maybe hear a slight jingling of spurs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The story I published in CutBank (issue 60) several years ago was my imagining of the life of a Wyoming biology professor/Bigfoot researcher, which brings me to my final topic in today&#8217;s Roundup.&nbsp; Thomas Scott McKenzie over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slushpile.net/index.php/2008/06/27/now-this-is-awesome/" title="Slushpile.Net took note">Slushpile.Net took note</a> of an item in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/lunch/free/" title="Publishers Lunch">Publishers Lunch</a>, which reported Robert Morgan&#8217;s deal for his <I>Bigfoot Observer&#8217;s Field Manual</I>, described as a &#8220;practical field manual written by a leading expert on the subject meant to entice a peaceful encounter with a mythical forest giant.&#8221;  Wait a second--if Bigfoot is &#8220;mythical,&#8221; how can people expect to encounter him?&nbsp; I guess we&#8217;ll all find out when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinewindspress.com/" title="Pine Winds Press">Pine Winds Press</a> publishes this indispensable nature guide later this year.
</p>
<p>
And while we&#8217;re on the subject of Bigfoot, I found it interesting that the only comments I received on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_m_armstrong/C39/L39/" title="my interview with Professor David M. Armstrong">my interview with Professor David M. Armstrong</a> last week were Bigfoot-related.&nbsp; Armstrong, the author of <I>Rocky Mountain Mammals</I>, is an expert on the mammals of this region, and for fun I threw him a Bigfoot question.&nbsp; No readers had anything to say about his astute observations on pikas, mountain lions, or montane voles, animals that apparently need to sign on with Bigfoot&#8217;s publicist.

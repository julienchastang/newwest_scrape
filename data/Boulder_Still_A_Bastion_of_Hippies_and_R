							Many Boulderites who have lived in this town for decades have noted its evolution from a sleepy little college town full of pot-smoking hippies and political radicals into what it is today: More of a haven for wealthy coastal transpants to reside in million dollar homes in a charming and beautiful setting.  But in the eyes of the national media, Boulder is still the place to turn to when a journalist is writing an article that includes those pot-smoking hippies and radicals.  This weekend alone, there were two prominent examples of this phenomenon.  First, in the <i>New York Times</i> Sunday edition, Stephanie Rosenbloom wrote about the amusing specificity to be found in Craig's List roommate-wanted ads (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/07/realestate/07listing.html?_r=1&oref=login" title="The Nitpicking Nation">The Nitpicking Nation</a>).  She cited requests for female roommates instead of males, quiet, professional types, and non-smokers.  But she went on to note:<br />
<br />
"But while cigarettes are a deal breaker for some, a number of Craigslist users across the country (Denver and Boulder, Colo.; San Francisco; Boston; and Portland, Ore., to name but a few) say that they are '420 friendly,' slang for marijuana use. References to 420 were nonexistent in other cities, including Little Rock, Ark.; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Boise, Idaho."  Who knew Santa Fe was so square?<br />
<br />
Then on NPR's Sunday evening All Things Considered broadcast, Jeff Brady reported on the phenomenon of small organic farmers becoming disgruntled with the practices of larger organic dairies and farms, such as locally-headquartered Horizon Organic (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5389487" title="Farmers Say Mega-Dairies Milk the Organic System">Farmers Say Mega-Dairies Milk the Organic System</a>).  He found a hotbed of such protestors at Boulder's own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldercoop.org/" title="Co-Op Market">Co-Op Market</a>, where a manager was yanking Horizon products from the shelves.<br />
<br />
So maybe the rising housing prices haven't sent all the hippies and radicals packing.  Or maybe the ones that remain have just become very media-savvy.

		<p>I will personally pay you $100 for every genuine hippy or radical you find living in Boulder.  They are but a remnant of the town's colorful past (go up Boulder Canyon a few thousand feet to Nederland if you want to find some survivors of the 60's Counterculture Wars).<br />
<br />
Boulder is now is an ephemeral city full of wealthy types who don't need jobs, the merchants & service people who make a living off them, an aging cadre of liberals who have persisted over the years (and are amazed how much their 2 br bungalows are now worth); plus the ever-present students numbering about 25,000 (??) at the U of CO who make up the bulk of what headline seeking journalists from NYC write about.  The latter 18 to 21 yr olds don't really live here (they are only visiting on mommy & daddie's dime), and smoke dope and drink liquor just like every other healthy American college student.</p>

		<p>I was one of those "hippies" or as we called ourselves "lost souls" on the hill for the first time in April of 1969.  Folks knew me there between 1969 and 1970.  I was originally from Massachusetts and where I am from now and have been for many years.....oh, key ingredient...people knew me as "Mouse"...<br />
<br />
If anyone out there knows anyone from the "family" I had known...whether it be folks into the Urantia book to the "happy Buddhists" that I was around ....please forward some information to me....I hear there are folks from the old days still out in those mountains....sometimes I roll into the area for a vacation and a visit with old friends that have settled out there from Northampton, Mass....<br />
<br />
Anyways, if anyone has any leads...I would appreciate it!<br />
<br />
Thanks! and be well!</p>

		<p>I was there also, 1971 - 1975 Think I knew you. Worked xytek in Boulder Remember the Good Earth? Many good times. Think you built a home in Longmont. Still have friends out there living in Louisville and area. Yeah, just a rich snobby haven out there now.</p>

		<p>I lived on the Hill in a home rented by Mark Alexander a Denver attorney...several of us including a decendant of James J Hill the founder of the Northern Pacific RR..it was on Euclid near Beach Park on either 10th or 12th...who knows  :) ...soon as I moved in there was a speech by SI Hayakawa at Macky and the Denver Panthers tore the place up.. and of course the obligatory trips back home to Illinois or San Francisco in my VW bus..in any case its difficult to describe those times in Boulder or Berkeley or anywhere in the USA...as Pete Seeger says.."wasn't that a time" its almost 40 yrs on and many of us would like to find someone in our memories from those days and ask..."what did you feel.."  "wasnt that a time"....  I know every generation has their radical this or that or own special memories but those of us going through all that in Boulder in the late 60's have a unique perspective/reason to say " Wow"......</p>

		<b>Comment By Joe the Stoner, 3-01-09</b>
		<p>On any given day (except maybe cold and snowy days) you may see one or two legitimate hippies walking down Pearl Street in downtown Boulder, or see the remnants of Boulder's past by visiting Nederland, a small hippie mountain community just a short drive up the mountain from Boulder, a straight shot up Canyon Blvd.<br />
<br />
While there are many select "rich folks" in Boulder, there is also a growing "Neo-Hippies of the 21st century" group of people living in South Boulder.  The movement is growing still today.  As a matter of fact, I myself, Joe the Stoner, am a part of this neo-hippie group.  Please visit <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joethestoner.com">http://www.joethestoner.com</a> for more information.  An Official "420 friendly" website.</p>

		<b>Comment By Linda Noll, 5-14-10</b>
		<p>Ok, it's been a few since I wrote -  curious if anyone can tip me off on what hilltown newspapers or other ways to find out about the occasional reunions they have in those mountains.  I haven't had a lot of time to try and find folks - but I still say they have reunions up in those hills and I would like to connect somehow...anyone have a suggestion?  a clue?</p>

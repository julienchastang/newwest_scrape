							<p>Rick Bass wrote of his difficulty finding time to balance writing fiction with activism in his most recent book, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/montanas_jeremiah_rick_basss_why_i_came_west/C39/L39/" title="Why I Came West">Why I Came West</a></I>, but he seems to be on a roll these days, with that book currently a finalist for an NBCC Award, and a new novel sale reported last week.&nbsp; According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com" title="Publisher's Marketplace">Publisher&#8217;s Marketplace</a>, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt will publish Bass&#8217;s third novel, <I>The Lives of the Browns</I>, in fall 2010.&nbsp; The book is described as &#8220;a fictional account of three real-life 1950s era country singers from Arkansas who produced a unique and eerie harmony&#8212;the Nashville Sound&#8212;that for a brief period made them the biggest thing in country music.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve got a good feeling about this one, which sounds like a complete change-up in material for Bass&#8212;perhaps just what he needs to get his groove back.&nbsp; (Personally, I never thought his groove was missing, but based on what Bass wrote in <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/montanas_jeremiah_rick_basss_why_i_came_west/C39/L39/" title="Why I Came West">Why I Came West</a></I>, he thought it was.)  I don&#8217;t know what direction he&#8217;ll take this premise in, but I&#8217;m rooting for it to be a funny one, like his hilarious story &#8220;Goats&#8221; from <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/rick_basss_the_lives_of_rocks/C39/L39/" title="The Lives of Rocks">The Lives of Rocks</a></I>.

Speaking of Montana writers, the <a target="_blank" href="http://centerwest.org/" title="Center of the American West">Center of the American West</a> will honor Tom McGuane with its Wallace Stegner Award next week (February 26, 7 p.m., CU Campus, Math 100).&nbsp; The annual award recognizes &#8220;a sustained contribution to the cultural identity of the West through literature, art, history, lore, or an understanding of the West.&#8221;  I love <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/main/article/thomas_mcguanes_gallatin_canyon/" title="McGuane's writing">McGuane&#8217;s writing</a> and I&#8217;m hoping I can find a babysitter so I can attend.&nbsp; Any takers?

Oregon writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.floydskloot.com/" title="Floyd Skloot">Floyd Skloot</a>, author of the excellent recent memoir <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/life_reconstructed_floyd_skloots_the_wink_of_the_zenith/C39/L39/" title="The Wink of the Zenith">The Wink of the Zenith</a></I>, wrote in to share some good news.&nbsp; His <I><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tupelopress.org/selected.shtml" title="Selected Poems: 1970-2005">Selected Poems: 1970-2005</a></I> (Tupelo Press), won the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnba.org/2009awards.htm" title="Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association William Stafford Memorial Book Award">Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association William Stafford Memorial Book Award</a>.&nbsp; Plus, one of his poems will appear in the Best Spiritual Writing 2009, marking the second time he&#8217;s been selected for that honor.

The University of Idaho sent word that Mary Clearman Blew has won a Western Heritage Award for her 2008 novel, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/old_and_new_montana_clash_in_accomplished_jackalope_dreams/C39/L39/" title="Jackalope Dreams">Jackalope Dreams</a></i>, which was one of my favorite books last year.&nbsp; The annual award is sponsored by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/" title="National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum">National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum</a>.&nbsp; The awards will be distributed in April, and Blew will be in good company, as former Major Leaguer Nolan Ryan will pick up a Chester A Reynolds Memorial Award as well.

I noticed an announcement in the new issue of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pw.org/" title="Poets &amp; Writers">Poets &amp; Writers</a> for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.umt.edu/ewi/" title="2009 Environmental Writing Institute">2009 Environmental Writing Institute</a>, to be held from May 13 through 17 at the University of Montana.&nbsp; The conference will focus on &#8220;creative nonfiction about nature and the environment&#8221; and Elizabeth Grossman will lead it.&nbsp; I thought this was funny: &#8220;Lodging is available at area motels or with University of Montana graduate students.&#8221;  There you have it: Come to Missoula, study nature writing, and sleep on some guy&#8217;s couch.

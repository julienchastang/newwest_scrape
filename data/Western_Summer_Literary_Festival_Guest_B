							<p>I&#8217;m looking for guest bloggers to report on the many literary events taking place throughout the summer and fall in the West.&nbsp; Are you going to the Equality State Book Festival in Casper or the Jackson Hole Writers Conference?&nbsp; The High Plains Book Festival in Billings or the Montana Festival of the Book in Missoula?&nbsp; Attending the Glen Workshop in Santa Fe or the Taos Summer Writers Conference?&nbsp; Hitting the Hemingway Festival in Ketchum?&nbsp; Or attending any of the other literary festivals and conferences that are so numerous in this region that I can barely keep up with them?&nbsp; Please send an email to me at jenny@newest.net for more details.&nbsp; My first guest blogger will share her thoughts on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aspenwritersfoundation.org/" title="Aspen Summer Words Festival">Aspen Summer Words Festival</a> that took place last week.&nbsp; Check back for that soon.
</p>

&#8226; Colorado Governor Bill Ritter will introduce the state&#8217;s seventh Poet Laureate tomorrow at the State Capitol at 9:30 a.m.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marycrow.net/" title="Mary Crow">Mary Crow</a> has been Colorado&#8217;s Poet Laureate since 1996.&nbsp; The new Poet Laureate is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unco.edu/colopoets/poets/mason_david/" title="David Mason">David Mason</a> of Colorado Springs. Mason is a professor at Colorado College and an award-winning poet.&nbsp; His most recent book is 2007&#8217;s <i>Ludlow: A Verse Novel</i>.&nbsp; Both poets will be present at the ceremony.
</p>
<p>
A bit of trivia that I did not know: Colorado became only the second state in the nation to appoint a Poet Laureate when Alice Polk Hill took on that role in 1919 (she held it until she died, in 1921).

&#8226; Jeff Gailus reports that his first book, <I>The Grizzly Manifesto</I>, is available now.&nbsp; (Hopefully many of you attended his release party at Fact &amp; Fiction in Missoula on Monday.)  Gailus graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in Environmental Studies, and he currently lives in Canada.&nbsp; Phil Condon, University of Montana professor and author of the recent story collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/war_hits_home_in_phil_condons_nine_ten_again/C39/L39/" title="Nine Ten Again">Nine Ten Again</a></I>, writes about <I>The Grizzly Manifesto</I>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think Ed Abbey would recognize an articulate and angry compatriot in Canadian Jeff Gailus, author of The Grizzly Manifesto. His book is urgent and incisive, a clarion call to Albertans to save their Great Bear, and in the process, themselves. American readers will find a comparative reassurance about our recent progress in preserving grizzlies, and at the same time a stark reminder of how interconnected the natural world is, and how seductive the industrial tourist model of development can be. This is a supple, strong book that every Albertan should read and a book that will inspire anyone anywhere who cares about the living world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
To that I must add, the cover of the book is awesome, as you can see above.&nbsp; Is that not the perfect font to pair with a gun-toting grizzly?&nbsp; Gailus keeps readers updated on his latest grizzly sightings on <a target="_blank" href=" http://grizzlyblog.blogspot.com/" title="The Grizzly Blog">The Grizzly Blog</a> and on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Grizzly-Gailus/100000892120281" title="Grizzly Gailus Facebook">Grizzly Gailus Facebook</a> page.

<p>
&#8226; Billings-based novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://craiglancaster.wordpress.com/about-craig-lancaster/" title="Craig Lancaster">Craig Lancaster</a>, author of <I>600 Hours of Edward</I>, <a target="_blank" href="http://craiglancaster.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/amazonencore-and-me/" title="reports">reports</a> that his second novel, <I>The Summer Son</I>, will be published by AmazonEncore in early 2011.&nbsp; The book will be available in paperback and Kindle editions.

&#8226; Gretel Ehrlich will join the Wyoming Wilderness Association in leading a journey into the Rock Creek recommended wilderness in the Bighorn National Forest on August 6 through 9.&nbsp; There will be hiking and writing workshops led by Erhlich.&nbsp; The fee is $700, and there are two scholarships available.

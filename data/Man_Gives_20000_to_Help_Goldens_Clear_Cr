							<p>Lisa Knudsen, director of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mountainsplains.org" title="Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association">Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association</a> recently wrote in the organization&#8217;s newsletter about the fate of a couple of Colorado bookstores.&nbsp; Craig Johnson, the owner of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clearcreekbooks.com/" title="Clear Creek Books">Clear Creek Books</a> in Golden, Colo. was having trouble keeping his business afloat.&nbsp; After some <a target="_blank" href="http://denver.yourhub.com/Golden/Stories/News/General-News/Story~585361.aspx" title="media attention">media attention</a> about the store&#8217;s pending closing, the folks in Golden rallied around the bookstore, and according to Knudsen, one anonymous donor wrote Johnson a check for $20,000.&nbsp; Johnson hopes to keep the bookstore running, but says he won&#8217;t succeed unless people in Golden start shopping there instead of &#8220;stopping off at the Barnes &amp; Noble after work in Denver or ordering from Amazon at 3 a.m.&#8221;

Poet Bill Holm passed away recently.&nbsp; Although his roots were in Minnesota, he spent a lot of time in the southwest.&nbsp; Rumor has it that when he was in Arizona, he could often be found having an afternoon drink with Jim Harrison on the back patio of the Wagon Wheel Saloon in Patagonia.&nbsp; Arizona writer Tom Miller remembers him as &#8220;a fine poet and a raconteur,&#8221; and Minnesota Public Radio <a target="_blank" href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/02/26/billholm_obit/" title="offered this remembrance">offered this remembrance</a>.

<i>Foxy: My Life in Three Acts</i>
<br />
by Pam Grier with Andrea Cagan
<br />
Hachette Book Group, 280 pages, $24.99
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of reasons people read celebrity memoirs. One is to glean the juicy bits, the scandals, the love affairs, the details of how wealthy, famous people live. In her memoir <i>Foxy</i>, Pam Grier doesn&#8217;t skimp on the particulars of her romances with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Freddie Prinze, Sr., Richard Pryor, and others, and shares stories about the time she got thrown out of a club with a rowdy, drunken John Lennon, the time she drove Pryor&#8217;s injured pony to the vet in the back seat of her yellow Jaguar, and how she escaped the untoward advances of Sammy Davis, Jr.
</p>
<p>
But &#8220;Foxy&#8221; is more interesting for the second reason people read celebrity memoirs: to find out how an ordinary person ended up living an extraordinary life. If you didn&#8217;t know that it had happened, it would hardly be possible to believe that a shy, stuttering, horse-loving black girl growing up in 1950&#8217;s segregated Denver turned out to be the confident, brash, sexy star of Jack Hill&#8217;s &#8220;blaxploitation&#8221; films &#8220;Coffy&#8221; and &#8220;Foxy Brown,&#8221; Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s &#8220;Jackie Brown,&#8221; and most recently, the Showtime television series &#8220;The L Word.&#8221; Tarantino once remarked that Pam Grier might have been the first female action movie star.

		<p>I think Pam Grier is very talented. I'm happy that Quentin Tarantino helped revive her career. Tarantino also helped Uma Thurman, John Travolta, and David Carradine (Tarantino and Kill Bill are mentioned in the new book "David Carradine: The Eye of My Tornado"). Grier is probably the coolest of the set, though.</p>

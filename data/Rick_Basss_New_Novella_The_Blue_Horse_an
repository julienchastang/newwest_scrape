&#8226; Speaking of horses, of blue and different colors, it seems to me that if a book is set West of the Mississippi, it&#8217;s fifty percent more likely to have a horse on the cover, whether or not the book contains many horses.&nbsp; But there are plenty of writers actually writing about horses, and I came across a writing retreat in on the <a target="_blank" href=" http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2009/12/dates-announced-for-literature-and.html" title="Wyoming Arts Blog">Wyoming Arts Blog</a> specifically geared toward those people: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pagelambert.com/horse_literature.html" title=""Literature and Landscape of the Horse"">&#8220;Literature and Landscape of the Horse&#8221;</a> with Page Lambert and Sheri Griffith, at the Vee Bar Ranch near Laramie, Wyoming from May 29 through June 3.&nbsp; According to the description:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we learn more about how a horse communicates with the world, we develop a deeper awareness of how we communicate with the world. During this retreat, not only will we ride across the Vee Bar&#8217;s beautiful Wyoming landscape, we&#8217;ll also journey into the mysterious dimension between the verbal world and the non-verbal world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

&#8226; Denver novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carleenbrice.com/" title="Carleen Brice">Carleen Brice</a> is running a contest to raise money for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedeloresproject.org/" title="The Delores Project">The Delores Project</a>, which helps homeless women in the Denver metro area.&nbsp; Brice&#8217;s first novel, <I>Orange Mint and Honey</I>, was adapted into a movie for the Lifetime Movie Network, &#8220;Sins of the Mother,&#8221; starring Jill Scott.&nbsp; Brice is encouraging Denver-area book groups to donate money to The Delores Project, and she will attend a watch party for the movie on February 7 with the book group that donates the most.&nbsp; Complete <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carleenbrice.com/events.htm" title="details are on her website">details are on her website</a>, and she also has a contest for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.carleenbrice.com/newsletter.htm" title="non-Denver">non-Denver</a> area book groups.

&#8226; Rain Taxi has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2009winter/williams.shtml" title="an interview with Terry Tempest Williams">an interview with Terry Tempest Williams</a> in its Winter issue (Via Twitter.com/JimCarmin).&nbsp; In the interview, Kevin Smokler discusses Williams&#8217; most recent book, <i>Finding Beauty in a Broken World</i>, among other topics.&nbsp; She says that her father was a harsh critic of the book:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;my father&#8230;said that the prairie dog section is so boring that no one is going to finish it, and if they do, the rest of the book is such a downer they will be sorry they did. But I think there have been many other people who have understood it, and who stayed with it. I just had a woman email me who has started a prairie dog watch society&#8212;she&#8217;s outraged that this is a species that could become extinct within this century; she&#8217;d never known that before.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

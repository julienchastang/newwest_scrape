<p>
	At the front of Rick Bass&#8217; extraordinary, moving third novel <I>Nashville Chrome</I> is a list of 25 books that Bass has written or edited.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve read most of them, and enjoyed almost all of these stories, essays and memoirs.&nbsp; The only one I could never finish was Bass&#8217; first novel, <I>Where the Sea Used To Be</I>, a tangled love story involving a geologist.&nbsp; The prose was as beautiful as ever, but Bass&#8217; distance from his characters was too great and the pace of the book was too slow for me. 
</p>
<p>
For the first few pages of <I>Nashville Chrome</I>, I worried this pattern would repeat, as Bass settles into the world of the Brown family, a real brother and two-sister trio who were country music pioneers, friends and influences of Elvis and the Beatles. Bass&#8217; descriptions of the Browns&#8217; upbringing in poverty during the Great Depression in the woods of south-central Arkansas (near Mississippi where Rick Bass lived for several years), are lovely but distant from the characters&#8217; consciousness as we learn about their father, Floyd Brown, who works in a mill and is frequently drunk and verbally abusive. But then, 17 pages in, Bass describes something remarkable:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The secret to [Floyd&#8217;s] lumber&#8217;s quality lay in his children&#8217;s ability to discern pitch&#8230;There was a certain sound, a ringing, that a fully tempered saw made when it had achieved that absolute perfect edge. It was a sound that the men could sometimes hear, but other times, for whatever reasons, was indiscernible to them. The sound they listened for&#8212;the perfect blade&#8212;held an eerie resonance, the faint sirenlike echo of a high harmonic that was little different from the tempered harmony the Browns were already learning to achieve with their voices.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Bass skips forward in time and grants us access to the mind of elderly Maxine, the oldest Brown sibling and the ambitious driver behind their music career. She is a talented, compelling, difficult, heart-breaking character.&nbsp; Once you see her alone and forgotten, living off Social Security and disability benefits, and then see her at 17, beautiful, confident, and fighting with her father to be allowed to wear a glorious blue dress for her coronation as her high school&#8217;s homecoming queen, you&#8217;ll be a goner for this book and for Maxine. Maxine&#8217;s brother and sister moved on and led happy lives after their decade of fame, but Maxine still longs for the applause. In her old age, the goal of her life is to interest a filmmaker in making a movie about the Browns and rescue their career from obscurity.
</p>
<p>
<I>Nashville Chrome</I> is a book about longing, about fame and its corruptions and its aftereffects and the tempering influence of returning to home ground. The material is a departure for Bass in some ways, as he&#8217;s set most of his work in the West of his adulthood, but in more important ways <I>Nashville Chrome</I> continues and deepens the project Bass has set himself of exploring characters&#8217; interrelatedness with the land in which they live, and how their attachment to or distance from that home ground shapes their lives. And Bass is still writing about fire, a subject he frequently explores in his works set in Montana. In <I>Nashville Chrome</I>, there&#8217;s literal fire that burns down Floyd&#8217;s restaurants repeatedly, but more important is the metaphoric fire, the burning inside, that pushes Maxine to always reach for that next standing ovation.
</p>
<p>
What the elderly Maxine remembers best, Bass writes, is &#8220;the thing she lived for, the moment of perfect stillness when, after the last note had fallen upon the audience and was still settling over them, loosening, spreading out and then disappearing, there was the sweet and hallowed space in which the audience, saturated and bewitched, realized the songs were over but, entranced as they were, could not yet quite lift their hands to clap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As children, the Browns became well known in their community for their matchless three-part harmonies that were so smooth the sound became known as &#8220;Nashville chrome.&#8221; One day when Maxine is a teenager, she records her brother Jim-Ed singing and sends it into the radio station. The Browns ascent into musical stardom is rapid after that. But during one of their early performances, a cruel, exploitative manager induces them to sign a contract with him, and so they make little money as they travel across the country singing.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The family befriends Elvis before he becomes famous, and his first love is Bonnie, Maxine&#8217;s and Jim-Ed&#8217;s little sister. Although the Browns are little remembered today, during their height, they were more famous than any other musical group, topping the country and pop charts and headlining the Grand Ole Opry. Elvis&#8217; fame eventually surpassed the Browns, of course, but they remained fast friends, and Bass chronicles this friendship with authenticity and sensitivity.
</p>
<p>
Who&#8217;d have guessed that Rick Bass would be the writer to capture young Elvis so adroitly? I never understood the world&#8217;s fascination with Elvis, but after reading <I>Nashville Chrome</I>, I&#8217;ve made room in my heart for the King.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, this novel does better justice to the Browns&#8217; legacy than any movie ever could. <I>Nashville Chrome</I> depicts the Brown family from every possible angle, alone and together and in their relationships with each other and to their land, offering the sort of psychologically-complex portrait that only a novel can provide. Every character gets a second and third chance in this book, every character grows and changes. Floyd is in the end revealed as a loving and proud&#8212;if flawed&#8212;father. Maxine is exacting and difficult&#8212;at one point she becomes fond of tossing her drinks in men&#8217;s faces&#8212;but Bass&#8217; honest rendering of her is enormously sympathetic. Only a novel can do that.&nbsp; Only a novel, that is, written by a first-class novelist, which with this book Bass has proven himself to be.

		<b>Comment By Valerie Harmd, 9-16-10</b>
		<p>While I am a great admirer and follower of anything Rick Bass writes, I think the headline here "Bigger than Elvis" is way off track.  Elvis' singing and career made him "the king".  The two are not comparable nor in the same league.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Susan, 9-16-10</b>
		<p>Fascinating. What a departure of subject matter for Bass. I'm glad he doesn't feel a need to stick to Western subjects that have made him beloved and famous. Great review. (A note to Valerie: I think "Bigger than Elvis" refers to the Brown trio's fame -- at their peak, they were more famous than Elvis.)</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Rodney, 9-24-10</b>
		<p>Good review.<br />
For clarification, the way I understand it, Bass grew up in the Houston area and later lived in Mississippi working as a geologist before moving to Montana.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 9-27-10</b>
		<p>Rodney,<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right.  Thanks for pointing out my error--I've changed it in the article above.<br />
<br />
And Susan and Valerie, yes, the title was intended to refer to The Browns, who were more popular than Elvis at one point.  I can't think of any writer who rivals Elvis in popularity.<br />
<br />
Thanks, all of you, for reading this and commenting.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Valerie Harms, 9-27-10</b>
		<p>Despite the above comments, I am an expert on Elvis and can firmly state the Brown Trio were never more famous than him.  Your headline was a poor choice, detracts from the book.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.peggyshumaker.com/news.html" title="Peggy Shumaker">Peggy Shumaker</a> is an English professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the author of several books of poetry, including <I>Blaze</I> and <I>Underground Rivers</I>.&nbsp; Her poetry background is evident in every carefully sculpted sentence of her memoir, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Just-Breathe-Normally-American-Lives/dp/0803210957" title="Just Breathe Normally">Just Breathe Normally</a></I>.&nbsp;  This book is more than just pretty prose, though.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a gripping account of one woman&#8217;s struggle through a potentially life-ending accident and through her chaotic childhood.&nbsp; The wounds are on the body and in the mind.&nbsp; This is a book I will read again and again to decipher how Shumaker makes her magic happen.&nbsp; Clearly, this is a seasoned writer with an intriguing story to tell.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The beginning sets up the hardy Norwegian stock that Shumaker descends from, and, more importantly, the history of women in her family marrying because they were pregnant.&nbsp; In the case of her great-grandmother, a birth resulted in her death, and with her mother, it figuratively ended her life.&nbsp; The impact of this history is felt in Shumaker&#8217;s decision not to have children and to marry later in life.&nbsp; Sadly, another child almost ended her life; a careless one driving a three-wheeler on the same bicycle path on which she and her husband were cycling.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The title of  <I>Just Breathe Normally</I> relates to her mother&#8217;s lifelong asthma, as well as Shumaker&#8217;s own problems breathing after her accident.&nbsp; The image of breath ripples throughout.&nbsp; One of my favorite passages is this one about her mother&#8217;s asthma:&nbsp; &#8220;The reason she quit eating.&nbsp; The reason she loved quiet more than her own kids&#8230;The reason she didn&#8217;t want to be here.&nbsp; The reason she left.&nbsp; The reason we buried her breathless.&#8221;  So many passages are lyrical, succinct, and see into the heart of her characters and their situations.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Aside from difficult breathing, Shumaker&#8217;s life-threatening injuries also resulted in sight and memory problems.&nbsp; This off-kilter feeling is used throughout the book, as well as switching time periods between her accident, present day injuries, and her childhood.&nbsp; This fluctuating time mimics the way memory and breathing work.&nbsp; In trying to piece the details of her accident together to understand it, Shumaker says, &#8220;It takes months before my mind can see these nuggets not as separate chunks, but as part of one vein, as story.&#8221;  This sums up her memoir&#8217;s structure as well, and those little sections add up to a satisfying whole. 
</p>
<p>
The heart of <I>Just Breathe Normally</I> is about Shumaker&#8217;s unstable childhood with a wonderful, supportive grandmother, and young, immature parents that couldn&#8217;t stay together.&nbsp; Even though these character types are familiar, each of them manages to surprise throughout.&nbsp; Shumaker is a generous narrator, towards the boy who almost ended her life with his careless driving, towards the mother who neglected her, and towards her absent father.&nbsp; There is no whining about her life or her circumstances, and there isn&#8217;t a single false note.&nbsp; This is a narrator who knows herself, and her family, and lays it all out for us in rich details and vivid writing. 
</p>
<p>
Her parents&#8217; marriage is introduced as <I>My Father&#8217;s Wives #1</I>; a clever way to set the tone, as well as her father&#8217;s future marriages.&nbsp; Shumaker describes her absent father as, &#8220;We grew around the empty place his absence left in the family.&nbsp; When he was in the house, everybody felt crowded.&nbsp; It felt like having company that hadn&#8217;t called first.&#8221;  But even the father surprises towards the end of the book. 
</p>
<p>
The section of &#8220;Mother&#8217;s First Words After the Birth&#8221; is also powerful: 
<br />
<blockquote><p>Because I was her first, no one listened when my mother cried&#8230;So I was almost born between floors, my mother clamping shut her thighs, some panicky orderly pinning her shoulders to the gurney.&nbsp; My father, a lanky teenager dreaming of a shovel-head Harley with a suicide clutch, paced&#8230;Face to the wall, my mother spoke from far away.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it isn&#8217;t a boy for you, honey&#8221;&#8230;Imagine being the woman who would think, just after giving birth for the first time, that.&nbsp; Imagine her saying it out loud to her young man.&nbsp; Imagine her writing it down in the baby book.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<I>Just Breathe Normally</I> is what a book should be: moving and multi-layered.&nbsp; There is a surprise in the ending, which I won&#8217;t ruin, but after knowing it, the previous passages become even more interesting.&nbsp; Pick up Just Breathe Normally, it just might change the way you breathe, and think.&nbsp;

I tend to read a lot of memoirs. It is always intriguing in my mind to zone out my world, and hop into the mind and life of someone else thru a couple of hundred pages. So to that, I am always on the lookout for another good one to pick up when at the bookstore. After reading your review, this one definitely sounds like one I will be picking up for my summer reading. Thanks!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Lisa, 5-15-08</b>
		<p>I have yet to read a memoir that really floors me--I look forward to picking this one up.  After having a child, I find it difficult to read much more than short stories.  This looks like a book I can actually finish.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Heidi, 5-16-08</b>
		<p>I will add this to my summer reading list!  Thanks for the great review.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Rita, 5-18-08</b>
		<p>I'm hooked, I've added this book to my reading list.  I've just recently begun reading memoirs, and this one sounds especially enticing...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Susan, 5-18-08</b>
		<p>This sounds like a very intriguing book. Ms. Younger gives just enough information to get one hooked without giving away any secret details. I look forward to reading this book.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Matt, 5-21-08</b>
		<p>Yet another book to spend the lazy days of summer enjoying. Paula, your reviews always help me to narrow my list, keep up the good work.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Clare, 5-21-08</b>
		<p>A well delivered review on this memoir, I am not a fan of memoirs generally but will give this one a look. Thanks!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Judy, 5-22-08</b>
		<p>I rarely read memoirs, but after reading this review, I want to read this one. Thanks for such a thorough and interesting review.</p>

					<h4>Western Book Roundup</h4>
		
		<h1>Wild West for Book Industry</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">

							<p>A lot has happened in the book world since the last Roundup I wrote before heading off on maternity leave in November, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/business/04publish.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion" title="not much of it good">not much of it good</a>.&nbsp; In December, Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster announced layoffs and staff reorganizations, and Houghton Mifflin, a press with a long history of publishing Western writers (including A.B. Guthrie, Jr., Willa Cather, and, more recently, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_molly_gloss/C131/L39/" title="Molly Gloss">Molly Gloss</a>), announced a freeze on acquiring new books. Can you see the tumbleweeds a&#8217; blowing down the bookstore aisle?
</p>
<p>
Closer to home, Scripps offered the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/dec/04/rocky-mountain-news-sale/" title="Rocky Mountain News for sale">Rocky Mountain News for sale</a> and announced the paper would be shuttered if a buyer wasn&#8217;t found within a few weeks.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve written <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/entertainment/books/" title="book reviews for the Rocky Mountain News">book reviews for the Rocky Mountain News</a> for eight years, so I&#8217;m partial, but even after repeated cuts in the section&#8217;s allotted space (the book section now runs <I>behind</I> the professional wrestling column), the Rocky&#8217;s book section was one of the best in the region, featuring local reviewers&#8217; takes on national and regional books and editor Patti Thorn&#8217;s witty, entertaining columns and features.&nbsp; (By contrast, much of the Denver Post&#8217;s books section, apart from Colorado writer David Milofsky&#8217;s insightful column, is filled with wire stories by freelancers from elsewhere.)
</p>
<p>
The book industry looks like it&#8217;s shrinking, as publishers, bookstores, and book review sections and the newspapers that house them falter.&nbsp; But I take comfort in the fact that there are still plenty of people who enjoy books as much as I do&#8212;a lot fewer of them than in the past, sure&#8212;but true book lovers are not going to stop reading any time soon.&nbsp; In this century, book lovers might become the equivalent of devotees of the harpsichord and the autogyro&#8212;our heyday has past, but I believe we make up in enthusiasm what we lack in numbers.&nbsp; (Witness the Oregon parents who <a target="_blank" href="http://www.powells.com/blog/?p=4168" title="recently named their child after Powell's bookstore">recently named their child after Powell&#8217;s bookstore</a>.)  And I am not going to stop reading any time soon.
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;re in a sort of wild West for media right now&#8212;people are shifting away from reading printed books and periodicals, and reading more such content online.&nbsp; Nobody wants to pay for anything they read on the Internet, which spells trouble for people who make their living from writing and publishing.&nbsp; But just as lawless Western territories were eventually reigned in, this too will settle out.&nbsp; And like everybody else, I just wish I could guess where it was going.

		<p>Interesting reading! However, do you take books for review, or do you make your own choice? I have written a book and getting it reviewed is harder than writing it and getting it published. It seems that unless you are already established, no reviews are available. What comments have you on this?<br />
<br />

		<b>Comment By Carter Jefferson, 1-15-09</b>
		<p>First, I want to thank Jenny for linking to Jack Shakely's essay. He's not only one of our best reviewers, he's written a fine book that I think fits into the historical Western novel category--The Confederate War Bonnet.<br />
<br />
And for Michael John, don't give up hope. Getting reviews has never been easy; authors have to be their own publicists. We at the Internet Review of Books don't think books are ever going out of style, though they'll soon all be e-books, and we are beginning to fill the yawning gap where the newspaper review sections used to be. We do about 2/3 non-fiction, because novels get more notice on blogs, but we've added a fiction section, and as time goes by we'll add more new features. We need ads, but they're beginning to come in, so we'll make it. We're pros. Look us up, please, at internetreviewofbooks.com</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Rimel, 1-15-09</b>
		<p>The book industry has been in a state of change and transformation for over a decade now. Much of the shrinkage in the retail sector may already have occurred.  The old line was that books were counter recessionary, that folks read more when times were bad. Given the article today on the front page of the Wall Street Journal about how libraries are being swamped with new patrons, that may be true. (<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB123197709459483585.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123197709459483585.html</a> ) It will be interesting to see how the librarians that attend the ALA conference in Denver next week see things. <br />
<br />
The large publishers have been struggling for a while now, finding their way from book publishers to content providers on multiple platforms. At the same time, many of the smaller independent presses seem to have been thriving. As one of my former board members said some years back in the last financial crisis after perusing our year end financials, "Well, we did better than Ford, GM and Chrysler." Once again, this is holding true. I remain confident that people will always read and that some people will always want to read books printed with ink on paper and bound into a book. <br />
<br />
Speaking of tributes to Tony Hillerman, Craig Johnson, a fine Wyoming writer and favorite of mine, also penned a fine piece I recommend reading. You can find it here:  <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fmorenotes.wordpress.com%2F2008%2F10%2F29%2Ftony-hillerman-walk-in-beauty%2F">http://morenotes.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/tony-hillerman-walk-in-beauty/</a> <br />
<br />
Keep buying books, keep reading!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 1-15-09</b>
		<p>Thanks, everybody, for your comments.<br />
<br />
Michael, I wanted to answer your question about how I choose what books to review on NewWest.  My basic requirement is that the book either be written by an author from the West (especially the states of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, Oregon, and Idaho) or that the book be about the West.  I keep a look out for books that fit those requirements that are being published, and authors and publishers also contact me about their books.  <br />
<br />
I try to choose books that I think I'm going to enjoy--I'd rather review a book that I can recommend than spend the time to read and diss one that I don't like.  (In contrast, for the Rocky Mountain News, I'm assigned a book every month, and I respond to it honestly, whether I like it or not.)  I try to review a good number of books from small and academic presses that might not be as widely reviewed elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I especially enjoy literary fiction, memoirs, and nonfiction of all kinds.  Some of NewWest's freelance reviewers have different interests, such as poetry or history, so when a pitch for a book comes in, I offer it to my freelancers if I'm not interested.<br />
<br />
So far we don't have anyone who really specializes in genre fiction, such as mysteries or thrillers, but hopefully we'll add in reviews of those kinds of books someday.<br />
<br />
I read a lot, but I'm still not able to get to every worthy book.  I know it can be frustrating for authors who don't get reviewed.  But check around on the internet--there are lots of good blogs, such as the Internet Review of Books mentioned above, where you can send your books for review.</p>

		<p>Welcome back Jenny. Great to have your voice back. I would add to John's point on small publishers and university presses. I have long found that my obsession with the literary West is often best sated by these small but important publishers. The University of Nebraska and Oklahoma, for example, are two publishers of the West who have given me years of extraordinary reading.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bob Shank Jr, 1-16-09</b>
		<p>Jenny,<br />
<br />
Nicely done. I was sooo unaware. I liked John Rimel's comments also, particularly re/ reading being 'counter recessionary.' From a personal standpoint being a somewhat pre-Baby Boomer myself (b. 1944) and recently retired from that lot, I'm finding among my retired friends gobs more of us have now the leisure to do a lot more 'catch-up' reading we didn't have in our massive working years to bolster our Republic. Which begs the question of whether that ever-increasing demographic is being totaled amongst publishers - and the current library flood. I use my laptop prodigeously and on a daily basis to read the interstitial blog and news contents, but still prefer a good-feeling book in my hands in bed. Laptops can be taken to bed, too, but are still only convenient, not friendly, to my generation. And we're huge.<br />
<br />
In terms of 'western content' I've read all of Tony's stuff and everything of Nevada Barr's fiction about the western parks (the rest of her stuff as well), Reisner's 'Cadillac Desert', etc. So now, I've reposited myself into the classics (Warton, Hemingway, etc) but still craving new western authors. Perhaps I'll start with Ivan Doig...of course, I'll want that in pulp - not bytes.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John  Rimel, 1-16-09</b>
		<p>Bob, Thanks for the kind words. If you liked Tony, I think you'll become a fan of Craig Johnson too. Start with The Cold Dish. His titles are all taken from quotes, "Revenge is a dish best served cold," and feature a modern day small town Wyoming sheriff. Great read. Johnson lives in Wyoming.</p>

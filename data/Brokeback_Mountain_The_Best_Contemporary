							At the closing night festivities of the Denver International Film Festival Saturday, Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee received a standing ovation after the U.S. premier of his new film, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. &#8220;I guess you liked the movie," Lee observed amid audience cheers. The film, which is scheduled for limited release on December 9, is a profoundly moving love story that ponders great Western myths, plumbs its characters&#8217; connection to the Wyoming landscape, and turns on spare dialogue that reveals the poetry of Western reticence.  As co-screenwriter Larry McMurtry observed about the movie at an earlier event, &#8220;It says what it needs to say and then it shuts up." Ultimately, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> concerns a good deal more than the inevitable shorthand description of its plot as &#8220;a gay cowboy movie."<br />
<br />
The film, based on the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx, opens in 1963, with the first meeting of the principal characters,  ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). Hired by crusty Joe Aquirre (Randy Quaid) to mind sheep in their summer pasture high on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming, Ledger and Twist gradually develop a friendship that becomes a 20-year, tumultuous homosexual relationship, tested by the demands  and suspicions of their families and by the strict social code of the West.<br />
<br />
Ledger is transcendent in the role of Ennis, embodying the myth of the hard-bitten cowboy. His face is windblown and his mouth is screwed up into the tight line that comes from a lifetime of choking all of his speech into terse two-word statements.  He has internalized the prevailing code of manliness, and is quick to fight when he feels he has been disrespected. At the outset, Ledger is the more reluctant of the pair, having learned firsthand when he was a young boy that the penalty for violating the social code of the West through the expression of homosexuality is death. Gyllenhaal is the romantic, fantasizing about the two of them living together on a ranch one day. Ledger, the pragmatist, restricts their meetings to camping trips on Brokeback Mountain, far away from the disapproving town.<br />
<br />
<i>Brokeback Mountain</i>  offers something extra for the Western viewer, in its hyper-realistic depictions of a small Wyoming town in the &#8216;60s, where ranch workers live in a state of near poverty,  the only acceptable social outlets are church gatherings and the local bar, the only acceptable drinks are whiskey and beer, and the only acceptable course for a life is to get married young, have children early, and work hard until you die.  When Gyllenhaal moves to Texas, the film expertly portrays the differences between Texas and Wyoming customs, hairstyles, accents, and practices,  providing a nuanced look at the West that is rare in film.<br />
<br />
Part of the beauty of Lee&#8217;s film is the contrast between basin and range life in the West.  All of Ledger and Gyllenhaal&#8217;s trysts take place in the gorgeous Wyoming Rockies (capably portrayed by the Canadian Rockies). The rarefied air, the clear streams, and the snow-capped peaks mirror the happiness of the doomed couple during their brief moments together.  It&#8217;s basin life&#8212;in town&#8212;that wears a man down. In town, Ledger and Gyllenhaal are pressed with social, family, and work obligations, and must evade the ever-dangerous  gaze of town gossips. <br />
<br />
Ang Lee&#8217;s film is all the more powerful for the way it doesn&#8217;t spell out what lesser movies would.  The hint that several female characters know of and accept the men&#8217;s secret is expressed only through glances from the actresses&#8217; warm eyes.  <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>  excels in virtually every way it&#8217;s possible for a film to excel.  With superb acting, penetrating, spare dialogue, a gorgeous setting, a gripping plot, and heart-wrenching, mythic themes, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> could soon take its place as a classic American Western.<br />

		<p>What a thoughtful and well written piece of film criticism this is. Well done.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Marty, 11-22-05</b>
		<p>Thanks for the review. Being from rural Northern California, I appreciate your insights. Here's an excerpt from my blog, martymusings.blogspot.com:<br />
<br />
Take your man to see Brokeback Mountain!<br />
<br />
Your husband, boyfriend or Match.com date needs to see Brokeback Mountain. You must insist that he see this movie. Beg. Plead. Withhold sex. Do whatever you need to do. Watching two cowboys get it on will do him good.<br />
<br />
If he resists, drop this line on him: â€œIâ€™d wonder about the sexuality of a man who isnâ€™t secure enough to watch a gay-themed movie.â€? In a world where straight men have evolved to be cool with pedicures, moisturizer and plucking their eyebrows, they can certainly get over their issues with a little same sex nookie on the big screen.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sure, he laughs at Will & Grace, but his queasiness with male affection is why Will has had about as much on-screen romance as Jessica Fletcher. Weâ€™ll never have a truly open society until straight men get over their visceral reactions to seeing two men kissing.<br />
<br />
Most people, especially men, are still way too hung up over man-on-man action. Heath Ledger, who plays the role of Ennis, knows why some men are uncomfortable with the movie. â€œI suspect itâ€™s a fear that they are going to enjoy it,â€? he told Newsweek. â€œThey donâ€™t understand that you are not going to become sexually attracted to men by recognizing the beauty of a love story between two men.â€? Ladies, give your man permission to shed his macho veneer for two hours. And bring enough tissue for both of you.</p>

		<p>I don't look at it as a issue about homo or hetero sexual preference.It sounds more like a movie about two men who weren't looking for love in each other but it just happened.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patrick Killen, 11-29-05</b>
		<p>I agree with Wblueskies4--this isn't a "gay cowboy" movie as the media and pop culture have been portraying; it's an American love story, plain and simple.  With the help of a screenwriter friend in Hollywood, my boyfriend and I had the opportunity to attend a private studio screening in Los Angeles last week, and the film is simply amazing.</p>

		<p>This is a movie about two men in love, they have sex, they like it.  Don't take that away from us.  The Diary Of Ann Frank may have universal themes but to say that it's not really about Jews but about oppresion that we all suffer is a disrespect to all those Jews who personally experienced the Holocaust.  Don't take this away from us, it's a story about to men in love, sex and all.  If you want to come along for the ride fine but don't appropiate this story for just yourself, I'll share, but it's my story first and don't make it something it's not.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 12-06-05</b>
		<p>I actually agree with both sides of this debate.  On the one hand, "Brokeback Mountain" is more than *just* a movie about gay people--it also contains a rich portrait of the West and an investigation of life among rural ranch workers in Wyoming.  On the other hand, I think it's crucial to the plot that this love story is about gay men.  It just wouldn't have had the same dramatic and emotional impact without this element.  <br />
<br />
After seeing this movie, I felt like what  people long ago must have felt like the first time they saw Romeo and Juliet.  That's also a story of star-crossed lovers, but it's a little removed from our time and place.  It's more difficult to understand this feud between the Capulets and the Montagues than it is for me, as a Coloradan in 2005, to understand that there are places in the West that are not only not open to gay people, but can be outright hostile.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Heath Ledger's character is clearly someone who is so married to the environment of Wyoming and his career as a rancher that it would be impossible for him to pick up and head to somewhere that would be more welcoming of his love affair.  He's stuck with a love he can't shake and a land that doesn't accept that love, but that he doesn't know how to live outside of.  That's the heart-crushing aspect of this movie, I think.<br />
<br />
I think all the people involved in this story--Proulx, McMurtry, Ossana, and Lee--have hit upon a way to take a very old story of star-crossed lovers and make it totally fresh, and yes, the fact that the lovers are gay contributes to that.</p>

<br />
Um, everyone I've ever seen (including a forgettable supporting actor in the forgettable The Human Stain) has received a standing ovation at the Denver Film Festival.  I don't know what it is about Denver audiences, but it's kinda embarrassing...</p>

		<p>Hi guys. Really neat. Nana will get a kick out of it when I show her. <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fcheap-hydrocodone.gottaoh.com">http://cheap-hydrocodone.gottaoh.com</a></p>
		
		<b>Comment By Victor Laslo, 1-28-06</b>
		<p>While I appreciates a well written movie review as done by Ms. Shank regarding "Brokeback Mountain", I feel moved to express my feelings about the matter. The screenwriters subtle double-entrendes lead to many variation of the character names and the title of the film itself. First of, of course is to inevitably refer to the movie as "Buttfuck Mountain", the story of two cowboys tired of and disgusted by having to have intercourse with sheep (as most sheepherders I know do), why else wear the hipwaders and velcro mitts? Then the lead characters, Ennis (Penis) and his cowpoke lover Jack (Jacking off, masterbation, et al) Twist. "Oohhh Ennis, lets see if you (and your big engorged Penis) can stay on MY back for 10 seconds, yahoo, I'm a rip-roaring rodeo riding buttfuckin' cowboy". See what I means, not that "there's anything wrong with that". Butt, I do think that the names and such just cry out (ohhh Raul!!, rip me a new one!!!!, oops wrong flick) to be played upon. And speaking of CUTE, both of the leads are gigantic hunks, gotta love it.</p>

		<p>Oh no Victor Laslo.. it's not buttfuck mountain.. it's BAREBACK MOUNTAIN. with Jackoff Twist and Penis Del Mar. We also came up with Beavis and Butthead Do Wyoming, Sheep Sheep Chute, Any which way butt-Goose. Pitchin' a Tent and Randy Rancher Rodeo III.</p>

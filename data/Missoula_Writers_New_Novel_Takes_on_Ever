	Kevin Canty&#8217;s accomplished novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780385533300" title="Everything">Everything</a></I> tackles life on its elemental level, forming an understated drama out of the ordinary events of a handful of lives: birth, death, sex, youth, aging, marriage, divorce, illness and real estate.&nbsp; So the title isn&#8217;t lying.&nbsp; Written in spare, concentrated prose and suffused with wry humor and frank observations, <I>Everything</I> follows a group of Montanans at a point when they&#8217;re battered by the regular everything that has happened in their lives and are searching for what to do next.
</p>
<p>
At the center of the mess, there&#8217;s RL, a divorced, fifty-something single parent who owns a store where tourists buy bait and tackle and can hire out a river guide, such as his employee Edgar, a new father with an art degree and a restless streak.&nbsp; There&#8217;s June, a hospice worker who was married to RL&#8217;s childhood best friend until he died of a heart attack at 39, eleven years before <I>Everything</I> begins.&nbsp; Now she&#8217;s thinking of selling her beloved home, whose value has increased dramatically.&nbsp; There&#8217;s Betsy, RL&#8217;s college girlfriend who lives in a remote area with her family; RL agrees to let her stay at his place near Missoula while she receives chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
And there&#8217;s RL&#8217;s 19-year-old daughter Layla, who&#8217;s just starting to make the series of mistakes that will earn her the psychic misery, interpersonal baggage, and sun-baked skin the others are saddled with.&nbsp; She&#8217;s ready for it, &#8220;hungry for experience,&#8221; as RL remembers being at her age.&nbsp; At one point she looks down from her apartment window in Seattle where she attends college and sees a drunken couple in love.&nbsp; Canty writes, &#8220;I want, she thought, looking down at the drunk couple.&nbsp; I want what you have and I want more.&nbsp; I want all of it.&nbsp; I want more of it than there is.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
She&#8217;ll get a big dose of it before <I>Everything</I> is through.&nbsp; &#8220;I know this is trouble,&#8221; Layla thinks deep in the book, in the midst of a predicament lust gets her into.&nbsp; And trouble is life, Canty&#8217;s <I>Everything</I> seems to be saying.
</p>
<p>
Canty&#8217;s characters are prone to making extra trouble than is strictly necessary.&nbsp; Layla starts an adulterous affair with Edgar at about the same time RL starts one with Betsy.&nbsp; June, meanwhile, has declared, &#8220;I am officially letting it go.&nbsp; All of it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s widow anymore.&#8221;  But then it takes her some time to act in accordance with this declaration; she has mourned her dead husband for eleven years, living in the house they fixed up with the dog they bought as a puppy, which is now ill.&nbsp; &#8220;I am just sitting here waiting for the dog to die,&#8221; she thinks, and forces herself to take action.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
She calls a cowboy-hat wearing realtor named Howard to appraise her property, who declares it worth at least $2.2 million, and then she tries to fire up a relationship with him even though he&#8217;s not quite her type.&nbsp; She&#8217;s ready to move on, but she&#8217;s stuck in the mire of her past.&nbsp; Layla, who has been like a daughter to June since her own mother took off, has June pegged.&nbsp; Layla observes in June&#8217;s bedroom: &#8220;A surprising crowd of perfumes and powders on the dresser, a well-lit mirror above.&nbsp; June didn&#8217;t look like that kind of woman&#8212;green grass and fresh air was her look, short practical hair&#8212;but Layla understood that it was never that simple.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>Everything</I> is appealingly full of little stories, jokes, and vignettes&#8212;the one about the Montana grandpa who can&#8217;t understand why his San Diego grandsons don&#8217;t relish shooting gophers, the one about the hippie girls RL used to enjoy &#8220; before they all turned thirty and became strict and sour,&#8221; the one about the good-looking, wholesome Mormon girls in bikinis at the swim-up bar of a Mexican resort, ordering &#8220;Virgin Marys, Arnold Palmers, Cinderellas and coco coladas.&#8221;  All of these little digressions gracefully reinforce <I>Everything</I>&#8216;s themes, as does this paragraph in which RL remembers staying with his mother in the hospital while she was dying:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Her last ten days, when he slept in the waiting room, or in a chair in her room while she struggled for breath, RL sometimes took the elevator up to Labor and Delivery just to watch happiness, just to believe in it.&nbsp; Strolling the corridor, feeling like a spy&#8212;he didn&#8217;t belong there, he had no business&#8212;RL strained to see the new mother through the half-open door, the little blanket-wrapped bundle, the older brother or sister with balloons or flowers, the sad exhausted husbands who were happy but something else at the same time, something nobody cared to name&#8230;Even in the happy place, the other crept in.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<I>Everything</I> is suffused with an admiration for the remarkable Montana landscape without being mushy about it.&nbsp; Living in Montana has shaped these characters&#8217; bodies and influenced who they are.&nbsp; Montana is why Layla knows how to fish as well as she does (she &#8220;could turn a fat trout in a bathtub") and why RL&#8217;s hands are &#8220;battered and wrinkled and spotted,&#8221; and why the skin on Betsy&#8217;s face is &#8220;windblown and rough&#8221; from &#8220;a life in the open.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Canty has been exploring the themes of lust, adultery, parenthood, and the complications of real estate for most of his career.&nbsp; He&#8217;s delved these preoccupations masterfully in <I>Everthing</I>, plumbing new depths, creating an artful rumination on the way that &#8220;time annihilates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<i>Kevin Canty will appear at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitiesmontana.org/BookFestival/bookfest.php" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a> in Missoula on October 30 as a part of the &#8220;Shiver Runs Through It&#8221; Gala Reading at the Wilma Theatre (7:30 p.m., free), and at several of the panel discussions and readings throughout the weekend.</i>

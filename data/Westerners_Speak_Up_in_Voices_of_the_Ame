<p>
	Photographer Meredith Ogilby and writer Corinne Platt met each other several years ago at the Headwaters Conference, an annual discussion of wide-ranging issues facing the West at Western State College in Gunnison, Colo.&nbsp; At the time, Platt writes in her introduction to <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Voices-American-West-Corinne-Platt/dp/1555917151/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1264369922&amp;sr=8-1" title="Voices of the American West">Voices of the American West</a></I>, she was &#8220;considering who the people with enough passion and vision to make a difference in today&#8217;s West are.&#8221;  They decided to embark on a project of interviewing and photographing people &#8220;shaped by the geography of the West.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Platt asked each person they met with a series of questions, including: &#8220;How has the West defined you?&nbsp; Where do you think the West is heading, and what is your role?&nbsp; Are you hopeful about the future of the West?&#8221;  They spent four years traveling and meeting with businesspeople, politicians, ranchers, environmental activists, writers, and other Westerners, and the result is this insightful collection of personal stories and black-and-white photographs.
</p>
<p>
	<I>Voices of the American West</I> includes reflections from people whom many Westerners are familiar with, such as former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall and writer Terry Tempest Williams, alongside people who are less well-known, but whose actions have shaped today&#8217;s West, such as the environmental activist trio of Connie Harvey, Joy Caudill, and Dottie Fox (Fox died in 2006).&nbsp; The three women from Aspen began researching and writing letters to preserve Colorado&#8217;s wilderness in the 1960&#8217;s.&nbsp; As Caudill explains, &#8220;Connie and I started writing letters at my kitchen table.&nbsp; One of our first projects was to add on to the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness.&#8221;  Those letters and community meetings that they hosted had a big impact.&nbsp; Platt writes, &#8220;Together they are largely responsible for initiating legislation that secured a half-million acres of wilderness in Colorado.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	The women are included in &#8220;Fighting for the Wild Lands,&#8221; one of the book&#8217;s eleven sections.&nbsp; Other topics are &#8220;Preserving the Cultures of the West,&#8221; &#8220;Creative Ways of Working the Land,&#8221; &#8220;New Types of Economies&#8221; and &#8220;The West as Saudi Arabia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Frequently the book&#8217;s subjects contradict one another.&nbsp; For example, Jon Marvel, the executive director of the Western Watersheds Project, believes, &#8220;In parts of the West where the average rainfall is less than fifteen inches a year, ranching really doesn&#8217;t make sense.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an irrational idea that comes form our settlement history&#8230;We&#8217;ve tried to sustain it, and the result has been an ecological disaster.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
But ranches continue to be a major part of the West, and <I>Voices of the American West</I> features the reflections of several ranch owners, ranging from traditional to innovative in their approaches.&nbsp; Doc and Connie Hatfield are cattle ranchers in Oregon and help run the Country Natural Beef cooperative that supplies natural food retailers and Whole Foods stores with beef raised without hormones and antibiotics.&nbsp; As Doc puts it, &#8220;I mean, we&#8217;re a group of redneck, conservative, Republican, right wing, touchy-feely Earth muffins!&nbsp; And it is really neat that most of our customers are urban, liberal, secular Democrats.&nbsp; Yet there is no conflict.&nbsp; Those things don&#8217;t have anything to do with healthy land, healthy families, healthy foods, healthy communities, and healthy animals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
One topic that many people agree on is the danger the proliferation of subdivisions poses in disrupting Western lands and communities.&nbsp; The same story repeats itself many times: when a rancher dies, his family can&#8217;t afford to pay the estate taxes on the land, or the money a developer offers for the land is too much to resist.&nbsp; Whether land is designated as wilderness or whether it is ranchland owned by one family, many agree, the result is more open space free of development that sustains animal habitats and the classic open vistas that are the reason many Westerners live here.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Jennifer Speers took matters into her own hands by buying the Cottonwood Bend Ranch and an adjacent housing development near Moab, including &#8220;its thirty-two-hundred-square-foot model home.&nbsp; In an unprecedented act, she disassembled the house, pulled the pavement out of the subdivision, and replanted the land with native seeds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Ogilby&#8217;s photographs add an extra dimension to the commentaries, providing a glimpse into people&#8217;s natural settings, and offering clues about how they feel about their lives.&nbsp; For example, William Kittredge, who wrote the introduction, stands with a big grin next to his radiant wife, a portrait of a Western couple satisfied with their accomplishments and their surroundings.&nbsp; Doc and Connie Hatfield, those natural beef ranchers, have smiles so wide as they stand in front of a herd of cattle that it&#8217;s hard for the viewer to refrain from participating.&nbsp; Pueblo artist Roxanne Swentzell is serene and regal in her pose next to one of her striking sculptures of a Pueblo clown.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, rancher Stephen Gordon and his ranch manager Jon Robinett look uncomfortable and aggrieved in their photo, which goes along with their discussion of how wolves from Yellowstone have killed their livestock.&nbsp; Jill Morrison, who runs the Powder River Basin Resource Council in Sheridan and is fighting to moderate rampant oil development in Wyoming, has a tired dignity in her portrait.
</p>
<p>
Reading <I>Voices of the American West</I> is like sitting in on a most unusual cocktail party, where wealthy individuals and those of more modest means, lifelong Westerners and passionate newcomers, environmentalists, ranchers, politicians, teachers, and artists all have an equal chance to participate in the discussion about where the West has been and where it should go.

		<p>Holy Smokes,<br />
I went to the table of contents on Amazon. I didn't recognize a single Old West name anywhere, just a bunch of "New Westerners" and revisionists. Limerick, Flora, Foreman, Wilkinson, Marvel? Give me a break.<br />
Like Speers, came for the skiing from old family money back East? No wonder she could afford to do what she did.<br />
I suppose I'll check the thing out of the library, it's always educational to read propanganda. The shameful part is that people that don't know the West will read this and not know better.</p>

		<p>The New West is, and the Old West was full of hypocrites.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>You forgot a comma, Mick. Just replaced a lot of them, I guess. Hypocrisy is not a regional trait, however.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mickey Garcia, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>Well, you've got to see through the hypocrisy to see  the "regional" truth of the matter.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By dave, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>the difference between the old and the new when it comes to westerners is this:<br />
<br />
old westerners include ranching families who earned their way by blood sweat and tears.this struggle is characterized  by townsfolk who endured low paying  service jobs, govt work, teachers,  the occasional windfall of construction work.  all while searching for  the second job or the creative addition to income afforded by a yard sale, selling firewood, stalking game meat, all otherwise known as scrimping and saving.  it is the farm/ranch mentality of making ends meet.<br />
<br />
the new west consists of  the come lately's who basically cash checks for a living. their struggle is characterized by making sure their portfolio is properly managed. their  planning consists of caretaking their property while on vacation. making sure their driveway is plowed, having their grass mowed, and hunting for causes to fill their time. somehow they all have good orthopaedists because they seem to have  double jointed elbows so they can pat themselves on the back.<br />
<br />
the character of the west has always been defined by it's struggle. the old west 's struggle was one of survival.   the new west's struggle is more defined by asset protection and the  pursuit of causes.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>I sort of agree, Mick. The part about this book review that grates me is that it is promoted as being of "all stripes."<br />
Nah, there's only one stripe here, on the left side, and it's pretty much two colors, pink and/or green. The Robinettes are pretty much tokens in the larger package.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mickey Garcia, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>You got the New West Nailed spot on. But you might be a tad romantic about the Old West. The short human history of the West begins with the Hispanics stealing it from the Indians, then the Gringo's stealing it from the Hispanics and the Indians, and now, with the remnant Indian populations confined to reservations the Hispanics are stealing  the West back from the Gringos by being the low cost service provider for New West Nimbys and of course breeding like crazy.  The hypocrisy of the Old, Old West when the first Europeans arrived was that no one "owned" the land and it needed to be settled. The Indians begged to differ but didn't have the technology and firepower to back up their property rights. The hypocrisy  of the more recent Old West right up to the present is that the natives are salt of the earth, independents who hate the federal government. When in fact most of the rural western states have been heavily subsidized by the Feds from the very beginning. Even today, Idaho for example  averages about 2000 dollars per year for each man woman and child in Idaho in excess of what is sent to the Federal Treasury from Idaho. And of course as you so vividly described, the New West hypocrisy is CAVE BANANA NIMBYs (Citizens Against Virtually Everything, Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody, Not In My Back Yard)  masquerading as environmentalists who are actually trying desperately to keep other settlers from following them just as the Indians did with the original European settlers many years ago.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Skinner, 1-26-10</b>
		<p>Yeah, I remember going back through Dan Pat Moynihan's balance of payments thing.<br />
At the time, the first thing that struck me was that a lot of Montana's balance was for defense. In short, all those missile silos the Commies were aiming at first, were pork.<br />
Then there are the ag subsidies. They benefit producers, yep, but also benefit the processors AND all the city people who eat. Well, sorta. I don't know how things would shake out, it would be messy, but I guess in the end food would cost a bit less because the money isn't being filtered and skimmed through USDA. <br />
One thing I'll never understand....so we got all this pork to build dams and stuff, and now the New Westerners want to blow it all up?</p>

		<p>good afternoon  friends. I'm really into shoes and I was searching for the sake of that meticulous make. The prices as regards the boots were about 310 pounds on every site. But for all I base this site selling them for half price. I absolutely want those &lt;a &gt;prada cup&lt;/a&gt;. I will probably purchase those. what do you think?</p>

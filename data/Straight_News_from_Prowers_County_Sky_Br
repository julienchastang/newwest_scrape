							Lately itâ€™s become fashionable for literary tastemakers to declare the death of fictionâ€”again.  Some claim that we are living in such harrowing times that only nonfiction is suited to addressing them, an idea that caused the <i>Atlantic Monthy</i> to eliminate short stories recently and <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> to shift the bulk of its coverage to nonfiction.  Reading Laura Pritchettâ€™s debut novel, <i>Sky Bridge</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.milkweed.org/sky_bridge.html" title="Milkweed Editions">Milkweed Editions</a>), has prompted me to think of a rebuttal for the nonfiction hounds: Thereâ€™s some news that nonfiction writers just donâ€™t seem to cover, there are some places they tend to overlook, and to get a more accurate picture of whatâ€™s going on out there, sometimes we need fiction writers to tell the story.  Pritchettâ€™s book, set in a small, unnamed town near Lamar on Coloradoâ€™s eastern plains, tells the story of a twenty-two-year-old woman named Libby.  It also tells the story of life in a small town and of the outside forces such as Mexican immigration that are influencing the economy in eastern Colorado.  If youâ€™ve ever passed through a rural Western town on a road trip and wondered about the people who live there (What do people do for work?  How do they keep their children from leaving town?  What do they do on the weekends?) <i>Sky Bridge</i> offers many compelling answers.<br />
<br />
The book opens on the day that Libbyâ€™s 18-year-old sister Tess rides out of town in the pickup truck of a man she barely knows, leaving her newborn daughter Amber in Libbyâ€™s care. Tessâ€™ pregnancy fulfilled a sad statistical fact of rural life: â€œThe health teacher was always telling us that more kids are born to single moms in rural areas like this than in inner cities, contrary to popular belief, and that a third of the girls in the room would be pregnant before we graduated.â€? When Tess revealed she was pregnant, the sisters made a pact: Libby would raise the child if Tess agreed not to abort it. But as Tess drives off, Libby has considerable second thoughts.  Lack of money prevented her from going to college, so Libby earns minimum wage as a grocery store clerk and she lives in a run-down home with her mother Kay, a tough-as-nails ranch hand who routinely insults her daughters and doesnâ€™t want to help with the raising of her grandchild.<br />
<br />
Libby dreams of going to community college and of raising Amber in more inspiring circumstances: â€œIn an apartment in town, mice wouldnâ€™t leave black shit everywhere, spiders wouldnâ€™t fill the corners with webs, the freezer would actually freeze things, the cat litter box wouldnâ€™t be stinking.â€? Libby has a lot on her mindâ€”she knows she should break up with her boyfriend because she doesnâ€™t love him, she has no idea how to contact Tess after sheâ€™s run off, and she doesnâ€™t know if she can handle raising Amber by herself with no financial help from anyone. After too many sleepless nights, Libby is wavering in her resolve to raise Amber, and Amberâ€™s absentee father shows up and announces that heâ€™s going to sue for custody. Meanwhile, Libby learns from her friend Miguel that Tess got a job driving Mexican illegal immigrants, whose labor the townâ€™s ranchers depend upon. To cope with it all, Libby starts stealing beer from the store where she works.<br />
<br />
Somehow Pritchett resolves all these issues beautifully in the spare, 220 page novel.  Even more gripping than the plot, though, are Pritchettâ€™s descriptions of life in eastern Colorado, including an account of the drought that hit the state in recent years: â€œItâ€™s never been like thisâ€”even I remember how on summer afternoons the clouds would boil up and send down rain.  Now, the heat feels dangerous, like itâ€™s pressing down to suck away the life of this earth, and even worse, itâ€™s doing it quietly, like an evil thing waiting for us to not notice so it can pounce.â€?  In Libby, Pritchett has created a refined portrait of a rural Western woman who calls it like it is in her frank, understated narration: â€œIâ€™ve touched the secret petroglyphs that only the locals know about, mostly because those laces are also our party spotsâ€”seems like the earth pulls you to places too, and certain spots are just good for hanging out whether youâ€™re an Indian doing a drawing or a white girl getting drunk.â€?<br />
<br />
With <i>Sky Bridge</i>, Laura Pritchettâ€”whose short story collection <i>Hellâ€™s Bottom, Colorado</i> won the PEN/USA West Award for Ficitionâ€”has proven that you donâ€™t have to write nonfiction to communicate the truth about life in the West.<br />

		<p>Sounds like a carefully drawn story.  Fiction can do a lot to share perspective. In this case in 300 pages. If you want that much.  A 3-15 page good non-fiction article can also do pretty well and I've seen some good ones cover similar ground. And 3-5 minute country songs. And just sitting in a diner, trailer park, or local night time hang out for a hour will do a lot of the same. Different sources, take your pick. For the time it takes to get thru 300 pages, I can read dozens of shorter, and if carefully selected, equally enlightening pieces, so I turn to the 300 page form fairly selectively.  But to each her/his own choice.</p>

		<p>After reading Jennyâ€™s review I am intrigued  by the story in Sky Bridge.  Unlike the 1st commenter, K, I enjoy a great piece of fiction or nonfiction regardless of the page size.</p>

		<p>Jenny's review had made me decide to go to my corner book store and order a copy of Ms.Pritchett's book. I've self published a novel and am writing another. But, I can truthfully say Jenny's description makes me feel I've got a lot of work to do to match Sky Bridge. Good luck to both Jenny and Laura.</p>

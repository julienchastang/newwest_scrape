							Denver is known for its wide array of top quality steakhouses, both those that are local operations—such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brookssteakhouse.com/menu.htm" title="Brook's Steak House">Brook's Steak House</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elways.com/" title="Elway's">Elway's</a>—and those that are part of chains, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.delfriscos.com/" title="Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House">Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sullivansteakhouse.com/" title="Sullivan's">Sullivan's</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mortons.com" title="Morton's">Morton's</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ruthschris.com/" title="Ruth's Chris">Ruth's Chris</a> Steakhouse.  But with a prime cut of steak running in the $30 range at these establishments, some of us would never be able to afford to dine at them, were it not for the glorious art of freeloading.  I have been to Del Frisco's and Morton's several times, and this weekend I ate a succulent Filet Mignon that was as big as a linebacker's fist at Brook's—all without ever once picking up the tab.  How do I do it?  The answer is simple: Whatever your politics, it's important to maintain close ties with Republican friends and relatives if you ever want to score a juicy, premium steak.<br />
<br />
I am a registered independent and I haven't voted for a Republican in years; this puts me on the lefty fringe of the majority of my family members.  I still manage to stay in their good graces, however, by refraining from provoking them most of the time.  For example, when I heard that my brother's girlfriend's mother pulled some strings to get the kids tickets to one of George W. Bush's inaugural balls in 2005, I merely said, "Gee, that sounds like an exciting opportunity!"  This strategy of non-provocation paid off this weekend, when my brother's girlfriend was celebrating her 21st birthday.  Her mother decided to throw a big party at Brook's Steakhouse, and I was invited.  We feasted on scallops, crab cakes, porterhouses, rib eyes, filets, and New York strips.  As I wiped the grease from my lips, I felt like a fat cat in a red state.<br />
<br />
Every time I've ever been invited to a celebratory steakhouse dinner, the person picking up the tab has been a Republican.  I don't know if this is because Republicans tend to be wealthier, and therefore better able to bankroll such events, if Republicans just like a good steak, or if my experiences have all been coincidental.  Whatever the reason for people's largess, the subject of politics never comes up at these dinners, as everyone is too busy enjoying dinner to worry about the world outside the steakhouse.  And for one night during troubling times, that's not such a bad thing.<br />

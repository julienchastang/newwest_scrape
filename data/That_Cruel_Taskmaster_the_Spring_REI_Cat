							<p>The snow that fell in December is still on the ground, and Colorado faces a week of frigid temperatures, but the first sign of warmer days ahead has arrived: the spring REI catalogue.&nbsp; This year&#8217;s theme: &#8220;Bring it Outside.&#8221;  In Boulder, REI is a juggernaut, having put the EMS in town out of business a few years ago.&nbsp; Now the REI on 28th Street is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/Jan/12/old-navy-to-set-sail-with-banana/" title="planning to overtake the space of the recently shuttered Old Navy">planning to overtake the space of the recently shuttered Old Navy</a> next door, building a 42,000 square-foot flagship store.&nbsp; So you can bet that these catalogues are papering the town, infecting the snow-weary with spring fever.
</p>
<p>
The insouciant REI catalogue cover boy looks about three days into growing a goatee, and he&#8217;s jogging through hills covered in lupine wearing a yellow shirt with state-of-the-art sweat-wicking properties.&nbsp; How did people exercise in the days before wicking, their perspiration pooling in their lumpen gray cotton sweatpants?&nbsp; Now they can wear &#8220;All-Sport tights,&#8221; depicted on page five, clinging to a pair of legs with no torso or feet, right hip canted jauntily to the side.&nbsp; &#8220;If you move quickly outdoors, these tights are for you.&#8221;  Slow-moving lard asses should try the &#8220;Fitness Pants&#8221; instead, which are suitable &#8220;for yoga and Sundays [sic] walks with the dog.&#8221;  But really, why would you buy an REI product that doesn&#8217;t wick?&nbsp; There are &#8220;highly wicking,&#8221; &#8220;fast-wicking,&#8221; &#8220;moisture-wicking,&#8221; and &#8220;sweat-wicking&#8221; clothes galore, some even offering &#8220;extra moisture management.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The word &#8220;management&#8221; is telling: despite the devil-may-care theme of the spring catalogue, which invites readers to toss workaday duties aside and run through flowering fields like cover boy, there&#8217;s a relentless undercurrent of protestant work ethic surging through the products on offer.&nbsp; The caption on page 64 says, &#8220;Mornings in a boring, stuffy, old conference room?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; Grab a couple of coworkers and tell them the agenda for the week is bagging a peak or two.&nbsp; Or number crunching some stars.&nbsp; And best of all?&nbsp; There&#8217;s not a deadline around for miles.&#8221;  But there are pressing deadlines and goals to be met, as is made clear by the trio of watches on page four that bear the headings &#8220;Get in the zone,&#8221; &#8220;Stay on task,&#8221; and &#8220;Meet fitness goals.&#8221;  And who but an uptight workaholic says &#8220;Bah!&#8221; anymore?
</p>
<p>
Not even jellybean eaters are allowed to slack, apparently, because now there are &#8220;Jelly Belly Sport Beans&#8221; available for one dollar a pack, offering &#8220;carbs, electrolytes and vitamins B &amp; C.&#8221;  For those who want to caffeinate in order to better meet goals and bag peaks so thoroughly that they&#8217;ll stay good and bagged, there&#8217;s the &#8220;REI Double Shot Press Mug.&#8221;  &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got access to hot water, you can enjoy hot java wherever you are,&#8221; so there&#8217;s no excuse to lie in past sunrise when camping.&nbsp; And you can keep caffeinating your way to outdoor dominance all day long because the &#8220;Air-tight canister in the base of the mug stores the next cup&#8217;s ground coffee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At first glance, the REI catalogue made me long for spring, but on second thought, spring sounds like way too much work.&nbsp; Better to stay inside, snowbound, wearing cotton sweatpants and eating regular jellybeans that lack redeeming qualities.

Last year when I was reading Michael Punke&#8217;s excellent <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/buffalo_george_michael_punkes_last_stand/C39/L39/" title="Last Stand: George Bird Grinnell, the Battle to Save the Buffalo, and the Birth of the New West">Last Stand: George Bird Grinnell, the Battle to Save the Buffalo, and the Birth of the New West</a></I>, one detail about the how buffalo came to be rescued from the brink of extinction stood out: many of Yellowstone&#8217;s buffalo came from a single herd preserved and nurtured by a woman named Mary Ann Goodnight, who settled in West Texas&#8217;s Palo Duro Canyon in 1876.&nbsp; She and her husband Charles raised orphaned buffalo calves left behind after the mass slaughter, and their animals served as crucial breeding stock for the restoration of the Yellowstone herd.
<br />
  
<br />
This seems to be the perfect tidbit to interest children in the history of the buffalo in the West, and Tracey E. Fern&#8217;s debut picture book for ages 4 to 8, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Music-Tracey-Fern/dp/0618723412" title="Buffalo Music">Buffalo Music</a></I>, tells just this tale of one pioneer woman whose actions helped avert a species&#8217; extinction.
</p>
<p>
In Fern&#8217;s book, the ranch woman is named Molly, and it seems like she&#8217;d have enough to do without taking in stray buffalo&#8212;Lauren Castillo&#8217;s drawings depict her hoeing, hanging out laundry, sweeping, and hauling buckets.&nbsp; When Molly first comes to the canyon, she works along to &#8220;buffalo music&#8221;: &#8220;the <I>huff-huff</I> of buffalo breath,&#8221; &#8220;the <I>scritch-scritch</I> of buffalo scratching themselves against the cottonwoods&#8221; and &#8220;the thunder of buffalo as they drifted like a dark cloud across the prairie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Buffalo are homely, feisty critters with a stubborn streak wider than the Rio Grande,&#8221; Molly explains.&nbsp; &#8220;My husband, Charlie, says they remind me of my own self and that&#8217;s why I have such a fondness for them.&#8221;  (Wait, did he just call his wife homely?)  The couple begins to hear the firing guns of buffalo hunters, and sees the piles of bones left behind as the animals disappear.&nbsp;  Castillo&#8217;s drawing of the gnarled mesquite and juniper trees with Molly&#8217;s wash blowing in the dry wind drives home the desolation of the place once the buffalo are gone.
</p>
<p>
In Fern&#8217;s telling, &#8220;a cowhand name of Billie&#8221; brings Molly a pair of buffalo calves, which she takes in and begins to nurse with a bottle.&nbsp; Kids will enjoy Castillo&#8217;s cute drawings of these curly-hided beasts.&nbsp; Soon other ranchers bring Molly stray buffalo, and her herd begins to burgeon so that she must fend &#8220;off wolves and poachers with the long end of my rifle.&#8221;  At the end of the book, Molly receives word that Yellowstone wants to rebuild its buffalo herd, and she gladly ships several of hers north in a red boxcar.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<I>Buffalo Music</I> will help kids understand how the buffalo disappeared from the plains, and this story sets a good example of how the determined actions of one person who disagrees with the destruction of a species can prevent it.

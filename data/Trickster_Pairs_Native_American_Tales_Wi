	<I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781555917241" title="Trickster: Native American Tales: A Graphic Collection">Trickster: Native American Tales: A Graphic Collection</a></I> is a beautifully realized book that arose out of a good, original idea.&nbsp; Comic book artist Matt Dembicki writes that he happened to find the book <I>American Indian Trickster Tales</I> by Alfonso Ortiz and Richard Erdoes at his local library.&nbsp; &#8220;The stories were serious, funny, mischievous, naughty, allegorical.&nbsp; I was hooked; I couldn&#8217;t put the book down.&#8221;  Dembicki soon embarked on the task of recruiting Native American storytellers to share trickster stories with 21 different comic book artists.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Finding willing storytellers wasn&#8217;t that easy,&#8221; he writes.&nbsp; &#8220;After all, there&#8217;s some heavy historical baggage between Native Americans and whites, and several people I approached about the project were unsure of my intentions.&#8221;  Dembicki persisted, and eventually convinced a group of storytellers to collaborate with artists.&nbsp; Each storyteller chose the artist he or she wanted to work with and approved the storyboards.&nbsp; The results are delightful: a collection of illustrated tales that are by turns funny or sad, but are always inventive and surprising.
</p>
<p>
One of the most beautiful tales is Dayton Edmonds&#8217; &#8220;Coyote and the Pebbles,&#8221; illustrated by Micah Farritor in pencil and gray-washed colors that give it a somber atmosphere.&nbsp; In it, a group of nocturnal animals consult the &#8220;Great Mystery&#8221; and ask for more light.&nbsp; The Great Mystery tells them to gather pebbles and &#8220;draw a portrait of yourself in the sky, as high as you can reach.&#8221;  Coyote, the trickster of this story, is late for the meeting, but determines to make the best portrait of all.&nbsp; Instead, he trips, scattering his pebbles and spoiling the other animals&#8217; self-portraits in the sky, resulting in the current arrangement of stars.
</p>
<p>
Coyote, a capable trickster, also turns up in &#8220;Mai and the Cliff-Dwelling Birds,&#8221; by Sunny Dooley, illustrated by J. Chris Campbell in bright, whimsical colors.&nbsp; In this one, coyote is a goofball who makes the birds teach him how to fly, and ends up losing his eyeballs.
</p>
<p>
The most common trickster in the collection is the rabbit, who challenges two buffalo to a tug of war and tricks them into pulling against each other in Michael Thompson and Jacob Warrenfeltz&#8217;s &#8220;Rabbit and the Tug of War,&#8221; loses his long tail in Tim Tingle and Pat Lewis&#8217;s &#8220;Rabbit&#8217;s Choctaw Tail Tale,&#8221; ingeniously convinces a wolf to become his girlfriend in Greg Rodgers and Mike Short&#8217;s funny &#8220;Giddy Up, Wolfie,&#8221; causes the alligator to lose his beauty in Joyce Bear and Megan Baehr&#8217;s &#8220;How The Alligator Got His Brown, Scaly Skin,&#8221; and talks a wildcat out of eating him in &#8220;How Wildcat Caught A Turkey.&#8221;  In these stories, the rabbit proves himself canny, nimble, and witty.&nbsp; The rabbit hasn&#8217;t gotten this much respect since <I>Monty Python and The Holy Grail</I>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the only animal that upstages the rabbit in this collection is the amazing dog in &#8220;Puapualenalena: Wizard Dog of Waipi&#8217;o Valley&#8221; by Thomas C. Cummings, Jr. and Paul Zdepski.&nbsp; In this story, the crafty dog is charged with the seemingly impossible task of recovering the Chief&#8217;s prized conch-shell trumpet from a group of zany-looking spirits.&nbsp; But Puapualenalena proves himself up to the task. Zdepski&#8217;s vibrant illustrations bring the Hawaiian setting to life.
</p>
<p>
Another story whose illustrations stand out is &#8220;Horned Toad Lady &amp; Coyote&#8221; by Eldrena Douma and Roy Boney Jr.&nbsp; Boney has created a charming creature who is equally lady and horned toad, a formidable figure who doesn&#8217;t have time to be bothered as she works on her pottery in the southwest desert.
</p>
<p>
<I>Trickster</I> will appeal to people of all ages, and it will introduce Native American trickster tales to an audience who might not have otherwise encountered them.

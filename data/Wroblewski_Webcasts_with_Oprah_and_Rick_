		<h1>Wroblewski Webcasts with Oprah and Rick Bass Named Finalist for NBCC Award</h1>

							<p>Oprah Winfrey raved about her latest book club selection, calling <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.edgarsawtelle.com/" title="The Story of Edgar Sawtelle">The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</a></I> by Westiminster, Colo. author David Wroblewski &#8220;the best novel I&#8217;ve read in a long, long, long time,&#8221; so I expected her to devote a regular show to the book as she has with club selections in the past.&nbsp; Instead, the show that aired on TV Monday was &#8220;Obese Families in Crisis: The Intervention,&#8221; and the book club episode aired as a live 90-minute webcast that evening.&nbsp; Readers emailed or phoned in their questions for Wroblewski, who seemed relaxed, poised, and grateful for the attention his book received.
</p>
<p>
Participants asked good questions, derived from the sort of close readings of the over-500-page text that would have made the New Critics proud&#8212;I thought the questions were sharper than those I managed to come up with when I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="interviewed Wroblewski last year">interviewed Wroblewski last year</a>.&nbsp; And, thanks probably to the producers&#8217; weeding process, there was none of the self-revelatory grandstanding you sometimes hear from people who ask questions at readings in book stores, unless you count a woman named Cheryl who mentioned her book club was reading <I>Sawtelle</I>, <I>Hamlet</I>, <I>and</I> <I>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</I> for their next meeting.&nbsp; (I hope she gives them extra credit!)
</p>
<p>
Among the insights that Wroblewski shared: The concept for the novel came to him as what he described as an &#8220;idea package&#8221; that included the notions that he was interested in drawing on classical sources, writing a story about dogs, and that it would involve something to do with language, which gave rise to Edgar&#8217;s muteness.&nbsp; I found in interesting that Wroblewski said his &#8220;tendency is to gesture toward comedy, not tragedy, so I had to reign that in&#8221; in order to keep with the tragic project he&#8217;d set for himself.&nbsp; He said he sees <I>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</I> as a &#8220;triptych&#8221; rather than a trilogy, and that the next book, which he has begun, will focus on Edgar&#8217;s grandfather.&nbsp; The complete<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/edgarsawtelle/pkgedgarsawtelle/20090126_obc_webcast" title=" webcast is available here"> webcast is available here</a>.

The detailed imagery made me feel as though I was walking in the golden grasses, that I could smell the stench of rotting horse carcasses, and feel the pummeling punches slugged into Hugh Davoren&#8217;s gut.&#8221;

							When former Colorado journalist Bruce Plasket couldnâ€™t find a publishing house willing to take a chance on his controversial book about the CU football teamâ€™s alleged sexual misconduct, <i>Buffaloed: How Race, Gender and Media Bias Fueled a Season of Scandal</i>, he went the self-publishing route.  Since the bookâ€™s October publication, itâ€™s been selling briskly at local bookshops.  According to a recent article in <i>The Washington Times</i> <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/sports/20051128-115229-7218r.htm" title="(Book: Colorado scandal inflated)">(Book: Colorado scandal inflated)</a>, â€œ<i>Buffaloed</i> has emerged as a hot seller for the Colorado-based Tattered Cover Book Store chain, hitting No. 3 on the stateâ€™s best-seller list for paperback nonfiction.â€?<br />
<br />
According to a Scout.com article by Mark Collins <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/news?slug=citadel-2_458561_148&prov=citadel&type=lgns" title="('Buffaloed' Book Arrives)">('Buffaloed' Book Arrives)</a>, <i>Buffaloed</i> was initially picked up by Prentice Hall.  â€œBut after a lengthy letter of warning from Baine Kerr, counsel for the plaintiffs in the suit against CUâ€”the suit that was thrown out of court by a Denver judge in March for lack of meritâ€”Prentice-Hall backed out of publishing the book.  Plasket was set to release it through a self-publishing outfit, AuthorHouse, but the second firm got cold feet, as well.â€?<br />
<br />
Plasket, who now lives in Albuquerque, had been covering the developments in the CU story for the <a href="http://www.longmontfyi.com/" title="Longmont Daily Times Call">Longmont Daily Times Call</a> when the behavior of other journalists aroused his ire. As he told <i>The Washington Times</i>, â€œThe media took one-sided information and press releases to create a scandal that didnâ€™t exist.â€?  Plasket calls <i>Buffaloed</i> â€œThe Book You Were Never Supposed To Read,â€? and explains on <a href="http://www.buffaloedbook.com/" title="his website">his website</a> that while he was covering the story, â€œNebulous but serious allegations against unnamed individuals were being printed and broadcast without verification or details.  If there was another side to the story, it wasnâ€™t being told.â€?<br />
<br />
This week, Plasket contributed an article to YourHub.com, a <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>-affiliated community news website.  In <a href="http://denver.yourhub.com/Story.aspx?contentid=31913" title=""Still Buffaloed"">"Still Buffaloed"</a> Plasket wrote, â€œAs expected, the Denver-area newspapers have virtually ignored the book, which skewers them in a big way.  In their defense, they have no obligation to promote the book, and I certainly wouldnâ€™t question their right to ignore it.  What is disturbing, however, is their ongoing blind eye to the issues that are brought up in the book and which have quite properly undermined public confidence in the news media.â€?  Plasket goes on to detail some specific offenses he believes the media committed.<br />
<br />
On his website, Plasket writes that â€œGetting <i>Buffaloed</i> into print was one of the most painful experiences of my life and one which I have many times regretted undertaking.â€?  The book's sales should ease some of Plasket's pain.

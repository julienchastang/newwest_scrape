							<p>As the folks over at the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2008/02/publishers-weekly-features-wheatland.html" title="Wyoming Arts blog">Wyoming Arts blog</a> recently noted, a few weeks ago <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6534628.html" title="Publisher's Weekly">Publisher&#8217;s Weekly</a> featured Torrie Rice&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wheatlandmercantile.net/" title="Wheatland Mercantile Book Nook">Wheatland Mercantile Book Nook</a> in Claire Kirch&#8217;s article, &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6534628.html" title="Wild West Bookseller">Wild West Bookseller</a>.&#8221;  Kirch writes:

&#8220;According to Rice&#8212;a self-professed &#8216;bookaholic&#8217;&#8212;Wheatland, a primarily agricultural community adjacent to a desolate stretch of I-25, halfway between Cheyenne and Casper, had always lacked a bookstore. The local library &#8216;didn&#8217;t have much,&#8217; either, for the town&#8217;s 3,500 residents.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So in 2003, Rice started a bookstore, but that&#8217;s not all she sells:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This being Wyoming, where a Wild West mentality still thrives, Rice sells the 4,000 titles in her inventory alongside products made and sold by her husband, Jef Rice: custom-built handguns and rifles.
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Sometimes, men come in for the guns and their wives come in for books; other times, women come in for the guns and their husbands for books,&#8217; Rice says of her diverse clientele.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Now we&#8217;ll head south from Wyoming on I-25 to Denver, where the venerable Chicano community theater <a target="_blank" href="http://www.suteatro.org/" title="El Centro Su Teatro">El Centro Su Teatro</a> has a number of events scheduled for the spring, including its Spring Reading Series.&nbsp; The series will conclude on March 16, with El Centro&#8217;s actors reading from &#8220;new plays over a cup of coffee&#8221; (2 p.m.).&nbsp; Next month, El Centro will host its 9th Annual Neruda Poetry Festival (April 17-19), guaranteed to feature &#8220;the hottest Barrio Slam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Authors across the region are encouraged to throw their hats in the ring for the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.billings.lib.mt.us/hpba/hpba.htm" title="High Plains Book Award">High Plains Book Award</a>, sponsored by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.billings.lib.mt.us" title="Parmly Billings Library">Parmly Billings Library</a>, to honor &#8220;literary works which examine and reflect life on the High Plains.&#8221;  Nominations are due by April 1.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the Boulder Book Store is hosting its 2nd Annual &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://boulderbookstore.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&amp;eventId=370009" title="Boulder Book Store Talks to Book Clubs">Boulder Book Store Talks to Book Clubs</a>&#8221; event on Tuesday, March 18 at 7 p.m.&nbsp; They will be recommending books that will prompt good discussions, talking about people&#8217;s book club experiences, and giving away prizes.&nbsp; To complete the book club atmosphere, cheese and wine will be served.

		<p>One of the greatest sources of a variety of books is the library used book sale.  There are all kind of books to be found in them as a rule.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Siouxzee, 3-24-08</b>
		<p>Torri's disdain for the town and the library is disappointing to those of us who choose to live in Wheatland. The library is very good. And most of us are NOT gun crazy, contrary to what Torri says. Maybe Torri and her mom Nanci would get more people into their bookstore if they tried to emphasize books instead of guns and hunting. Nanci's book reviews at wheaterville.com are a much better way to let us locals know about books than the look of the hunting lodge.</p>

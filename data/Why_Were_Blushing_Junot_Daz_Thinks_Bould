							<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.junotdiaz.com/" title="Junot D&#237;az ">Junot D&#237;az </a>gave an engaging reading from his new novel <I>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</I> to a packed house at the Boulder Book Store Thursday night.&nbsp; D&#237;az is that rare literary novelist who inspires ardor in his fans (literary blogger Maud Newton recently asked, <a target="_blank" href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/?p=7364" title=""Where&#8217;s the national Junot D&#237;az Novel Publication Holiday campaign?"">&#8220;Where&#8217;s the national Junot D&#237;az Novel Publication Holiday campaign?&#8221;</a> and made note of <a target="_blank" href="http://maudnewton.com/blog/?p=7832" title="rampant D&#237;az worship">rampant D&#237;az worship</a>).&nbsp; Reviews of the novel, including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5691601,00.html" title="mine for the Rocky Mountain News">mine for the Rocky Mountain News</a>, have been glowing, and everything about D&#237;az Thursday night was smooth, from his shaved head, to his black velvet blazer, to the way he slipped in a quick &#8220;salud&#8221; when a woman in the audience sneezed.
</p>
<p>
Before the reading started, I overheard some booksellers chatting about him.&nbsp; &#8220;He could not have been nicer,&#8221; one woman said, sounding smitten.&nbsp; &#8220;He&#8217;s charming, he&#8217;s sweet, he&#8217;s appreciative, he&#8217;s funny.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az began by asking the audience to tell him about Boulder, and explained that he doesn&#8217;t get to spend much time in the cities he visits on his book tour, so he likes to ask the audience about them.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been to your city before,&#8221; D&#237;az said.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s actually stupendous.&nbsp; I never realized--it&#8217;s kind of hot.&#8221;  He went on to qualify his observation: &#8220;I just cruised by, so I don&#8217;t know, it could be some sort of <I>Nightmare on Elm Street</I> type nightmare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The audience was reluctant to discuss Boulder, but D&#237;az persisted. &#8220;Boulder seems like a really interesting place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Well it&#8217;s not Washington Heights and it&#8217;s not the Bronx,&#8221; one woman finally responded.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Come on,&#8221; D&#237;az said, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to do better than Iowa City.&nbsp; They were complaining about road construction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty political town,&#8221; one man said.&nbsp; Another said that it has nothing in common in its political views with the rest of the state.&nbsp;  &#8220;The Independent Republic of Boulder,&#8221; a woman added.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Oh, so it&#8217;s like Cambridge,&#8221; D&#237;az, who teaches at MIT, said.&nbsp; &#8220;If anyone is from Massachusetts, I apologize for the calumnious statement I&#8217;m about to make, but it&#8217;s a fucking nutty state.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az was winning and natural in front of the crowd, which at most readings, let&#8217;s face it, consists largely of nerds.&nbsp; Having likely honed his nerd drawing-out skills as a teacher at MIT, he engaged the audience, chatting about the Tolkien thread of his novel and asking someone to explain who Morgoth is.&nbsp; &#8220;Morgoth was the previous Sauron,&#8221; a man said, authoritatively.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Are there any writers in the audience?&#8221; D&#237;az asked.&nbsp;  Most people were too terrified to raise their hands higher than waist level, but he was able to coax a young woman into explaining the problem of writing in the second person. &#8220;What if your audience doesn&#8217;t relate to what you&#8217;re talking about?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az explained that he had a teacher who made him write one second person story a month, and that he thought it was beneficial to &#8220;practice second person because it gives you muscles in other areas.&#8221;  He then read a passage from the novel that was from the second-person perspective of the character Lola.
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az explained that he &#8220;grew up with an ontological conflict.&#8221;  His mother was empirical, and always encouraging her children to study science and math, whereas his grandmother would say things like, &#8220;The reason your neighbor has no children is because his old girlfriend cursed him.&nbsp; If you have a girlfriend who his trying to curse you, wear your underwear inside out.&#8221;  This novel, he said, &#8220;was my way of trying to figure out a home for both my grandmother and my mother.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A woman who had lived in the D.R. for three years said she wondered if other readers were able to pick up on the un-translated Dominican slang.
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az asked, &#8220;But did people get all that crazy comic book stuff?&nbsp; Is there anyone here who got all that nerd stuff?&#8221;  He looked around.&nbsp; &#8220;Ah, no one will claim it.&nbsp; What about that dude that told me all about Mordor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t read it yet,&#8221; the Tolkien fan admitted.&nbsp; &#8220;Maybe I will,&#8221; he allowed.
</p>
<p>
I raised my hand and asked D&#237;az how he came to write a narrative that mixes omniscient, limited third person, first person and second person perspectives.
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az explained, &#8220;There&#8217;s a folktale that&#8217;s big all over the Dominican desert--it&#8217;s called the baca.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a shape shifter, but no one knows what its original form is.&#8221;  D&#237;az said he wanted to make a book that &#8220;at the level of narrative was a shape-shifter&#8230;Readers are always trying to seize the book, but a really good narrative is always slipping between your fingers.&#8221;  D&#237;az said he worked on this aspect of the novel a long time, &#8220;because the shifts were always visible.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Back at my apartment I have thousands of pages of failed attempts at equilibrium.&#8221;  He said that he wasn&#8217;t necessarily happy with the final result, &#8220;but I just couldn&#8217;t do it anymore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A man asked if D&#237;az had read the Marvel Civil War comic book series, and what he thought of the &#8220;assassination of Captain America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
D&#237;az bantered with him a bit about comics, then instructed the audience to &#8220;always read a genre, because all of the scary shit about people--that&#8217;s where folks let it out.&nbsp; You&#8217;d have no idea what our culture is about if you only read literary fiction.&nbsp; In literary fiction, people don&#8217;t even seem to have bodies.&nbsp; But the horror section is all about bodies, our fear of having them harmed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He said he&#8217;s always telling his students, &#8220;Talk to me about Roth and all those crazy fools, but you&#8217;ve got to bring that Stephen King.&#8221;

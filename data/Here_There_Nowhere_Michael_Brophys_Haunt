	The first painting I saw by Oregon&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ggibsongallery.com/artists/brophy/index.html" title="Michael Brophy">Michael Brophy</a> was &#8220;Night Truck.&#8221;  Although its subject matter might be considered ugly, it&#8217;s a beautiful painting, with a silver semi front and center, charging through a dark night, illuminated by the headlights of the vehicle behind it like a stage performer awash in footlights.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an evocative image that cast me, and surely many who look at it, back into memories of long night drives across the West.&nbsp; There&#8217;s something about it that reminded me of an Edward Hopper painting: maybe the name, which recalls &#8220;Nighthawks,&#8221; Brophy&#8217;s skillful use of empty space and artificial light, or perhaps its feeling of brooding isolation that invites viewers to question exactly how they came to spend a sleepless night following this steel behemoth, the natural world surrounding the road erased in darkness so that they might be anywhere.
</p>
<p>
	A reproduction of &#8220;Night Truck&#8221; appears in <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Here-There-Nowhere-Jonathan-Raban/dp/0870712950/ref=sr_11_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1213585432&amp;sr=11-1" title="Here There Nowhere">Here There Nowhere</a></I>, a selection of recent Brophy oil paintings that Oregon State Press has published along with essays by Jonathan Raban and William L. Lang.&nbsp; Brophy has a reputation for depicting the natural landscape of the Pacific Northwest after humans have altered it, though as Raban notes, he usually doesn&#8217;t including the humans in the painting.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
When Brophy does include people, he doesn&#8217;t emphasize them.&nbsp; There is a trio of tiny people present in the distance of the painting &#8220;Blowdown,&#8221; dwarfed by massive trees stacked on their sides, the violence of the effort it took to rip them out of the earth suggested by the grasping remains of their roots.&nbsp; Who did this?&nbsp; Was it those people, who linger like three tiny ants of the apocalypse in the background?&nbsp; Maybe not&#8212;it may have been wind or a volcano blast, but those people will surely become involved in one way or another, to claim the freshly downed timber.
</p>
<p>
Raban&#8217;s essay places Brophy&#8217;s paintings into the larger context of Western and Pacific Northwestern landscape painting, from Albert Bierstadt to George Caitlin, and William L. Lang writes about the commentary Brophy&#8217;s painting provides on the environmental degradation in Oregon&#8212;he&#8217;s known for depicting clear cuts and felled trees, as he does in &#8220;Aftermath,&#8221; which presents a pile of tree shrapnel under a portentous steel blue sky.
</p>
<p>
But Brophy&#8217;s oil paintings can just as easily be appreciated simply for their use of color and light.&nbsp; &#8220;There,&#8221; a landscape with a watery blue sky, a strip of mountains, a flat line of blue river, and a patch of brown earth offers a pleasant visual harmony.&nbsp; Many of the pictures in this collection depict darkness, such as the lush green field in &#8220;Meadow,&#8221; stretching under a starless black sky.&nbsp; &#8220;Full Dark&#8221; is arresting, too, a painting about night, with few signs of life except for the ghostly, grayish hints of foliage in the foreground.&nbsp; Again there are no stars to be seen, perhaps because of light pollution that plunges the natural world near big cities into profound darkness after the sun goes down.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In &#8220;Pallet Fire&#8221; an orange flame leaps up out of darkness, and seems even more haunting after I learned that a night <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/122527.asp" title="fire destroyed Brophy's house and studio">fire destroyed Brophy&#8217;s house and studio</a> last year as he was working on these paintings, including &#8220;Pallet Fire,&#8221; which he managed to save and restore. 
</p>
<p>
The second half of the book moves into daylight, with &#8220;Relic,&#8221; a depiction of a book cliff formation with tumbled-down chunks of rock littering the hillside suggesting the remains of some abandoned civilization.&nbsp; In &#8220;Day,&#8221; Brophy presents the sequel to &#8220;Night Truck&#8221;: this time we&#8217;re on the highway in the middle of the day, and can see the scrub brush on the side of the road and the mountains in the far distance.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re following not the imposing truck of the first painting, but a semi traveling without its trailer, which always looks so strange and off-balance, like a centipede running around without its body.&nbsp; What is it supposed to mean?&nbsp; Brophy has left that up to the viewer, once again creating an aesthetically pleasing painting that toys with romantic notions of the West and leaves one with a certain disquiet about the changing nature of this region&#8217;s landscape and our place in it.

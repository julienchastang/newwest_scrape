							<p>&#8220;Definition of a Circle&#8221;
<br />
by Otis Taylor
<br />

</p>
<p>
With his new album, <i>Definition of a Circle</i>, internationally-recognized Boulder musician <a target="_blank" href="http://www.otistaylor.com/" title="Otis Taylor">Otis Taylor</a> continues to stretch the definition of the blues to make a comfortable and flexible home for himself within the genre.&nbsp; Taylor&#8217;s rough-hewn voice is pure blues, but his accompaniment is restless.&nbsp; There are gospel influences in the bursts of organ and choir on the first track, &#8220;Little Betty,&#8221; and electric guitar licks throughout the album that edge the sound toward rock.&nbsp; There&#8217;s jazz trumpeting, R&amp;B grooves, and even some freewheeling instrumental interludes that jam band fans should enjoy.
</p>
<p>
Taylor often employs the traditional lyric repetition of the blues, but his careful phrasing releases this technique from monotony, as in the track &#8220;Looking Over Your Fence.&#8221;  The liner notes coyly describe the plot of the song in this way: &#8220;A neighbor threatens to take a man&#8217;s wife and land,&#8221; but the lyrics seem to point elsewhere: &#8220;Now I&#8217;m looking cross the fence/ When the oil starts pumping/ And my pockets dry/ I&#8217;ll be looking cross the fence.&#8221;  The song ends with Taylor&#8217;s chilling refrain, &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll go to war,&#8221; iterated with a slightly different nuance each time he sings it.
</p>
<p>
In &#8220;They Wore Blue,&#8221; Taylor&#8217;s bass-playing daughter Cassie repeats the mournful refrain, &#8220;Oh Katrina,&#8221; while her father muses about the disaster in aggrieved sentence fragments: &#8220;What would you do?&#8221; &#8220;Would you feed them?&#8221;  &#8220;Oh the water.&#8221;  Just when the song seems to be shaping up as a downbeat elegy for the flood victims, it shifts at the four-minute mark, and segues into an extended organ and guitar jam that leaves the downtrodden beginning of the song behind in favor of energy and hope.
</p>
<p>
On the lovely &#8220;Few Feet Away,&#8221; which the notes describe as &#8220;A lullaby from a father to his bi-racial child,&#8221; Taylor sings, &#8220;If the sky fell down/ and the moon went out/ I&#8217;d just be a few feet away from you,&#8221; over a delicate banjo and mandolin melody accented with Ron Miles&#8217; cornet playing.
</p>
<p>
Even when Taylor&#8217;s title and liner notes suggest a song is going to be politically heavy handed, his impeccable skill as a musician and storyteller render it into subtle art.
<br />
This is the case with &#8220;Mexican Cowboy,&#8221; which the notes describe in this way: &#8220;A confiscated green card forces a cowboy to go back home to Mexico.&#8221;  But the song isn&#8217;t a polemic at all.&nbsp; Taylor brings to life a character mourning the love he must leave behind, singing in the first person, &#8220;Well I&#8217;ve been drunk for just about a week,&#8221; his voice so ragged that you believe him. 
</p>
<p>
In his restrained evocation of current national and international woes, Taylor brilliantly makes the case that there has never been a more appropriate time for the blues than the present day.&nbsp; Taylor&#8217;s blues music is vital, engaged, and always surprising. He has been especially prolific of late, releasing seven albums over the past eight years, but as <i>Definition of a Circle</i> demonstrates, this outpouring hasn&#8217;t diluted his potency.

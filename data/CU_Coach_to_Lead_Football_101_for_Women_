							Tomorrow, CU football coach Dan Hawkins will be leading a program called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=507651" title="<i>Football 101 for Women</i>"><i>Football 101 for Women</i></a>, designed to teach " the essential elements of football like recruiting, what players wear on game day and the X’s and O’s of offense, defense and special teams," according to the CU website.  But although Hawkins is a new coach who should be free of the taint of the scandals that marred Gary Barnett's tenure, leave it to a local journalist to find something sinister in this two-hour clinic.  In Sunday's Denver Post, columnist Diane Carman wrote an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/carman" title="oddly vituperative and vaguely satirical attack">oddly vituperative and vaguely satirical attack</a> of this class, even before it had actually been held.  Okay, the title <i>Football 101 for Women</i> might be a wee bit condescending, but the content of the class seems like a fun idea, and the fact that Hawkins is personally teaching it bodes well for the football program's development of a better relationship with CU's general student body.<br />
<br />
The $50 fee for the class will benefit “the 'Your Team' fund designated for Women’s Athletics," according to a press release, so how misogynistic can it be?  I have always been a football fan, but when I had the chance to play flag football in college, I learned a lot more about the game (such as different plays and strategies and the responsibilities of each position) and became even more interested in the sport.  So this class would seem to be a way to bolster enthusiasm for the Buffs, something that is badly needed after years of scandal and woe.<br />
<br />
Local journalists relentlessly scrutinize every move the CU football program makes in order to find underhanded or sleazy doings, crippling the team's ability to emerge from years of bad publicity and become a strong contender again.  Although the CU football program has been guilty of some serious infractions over the years, it probably is no worse than any other NCAA Division I team in this regard.  Any organization subjected to the level of scrutiny that CU football has endured in recent years is bound to come off looking bad.  <br />
<br />
It's time to give the new coach a chance, and for local journalists to stop picking at the carcass of the CU football team.  In the press release, Hawkins said he's held similar programs “in the past at (at Boise State) and they have been hugely successful," so the CU version of <i>Football 101 for Women</i> is unlikely to devolve into an orgy of sexual harassment, ass grabbing, and misogyny, however much that would please Colorado journalists who have to keep filling their columns with whatever scandal they can exhume.<br />

		<b>Comment By joan, 7-31-06</b>
		<p>thanks very much for your comments....we need more journalists like  yourself who strive for high quality journalism and not scum likes others we know.  again, thanks.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Joe, 7-31-06</b>
		<p>Jenny thanks for the wonderfully written article! You so eloquently expressed exactly what I was thinking when I read Diane's article on Sunday. Can you image that article was the best she had to offer on the weekly peak of her readership.  Some people will not let anything get in the way of their agenda.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Richard Engel, 7-31-06</b>
		<p>I now remember why I appreciate the New West so much - progressives with very open minds.  I wish Jenny Shank wrote for one of the Denver dailies.  Instead of taking a pot shot at CU for what is merely a good PR and community building exercise, Ms Shank might actually attend the seminar and write about the experience.  Of course, in my dream world, Patty Limerick would be editor of the NY Times too.</p>

		<p>Thank you, Jenny!  Thank you for writing a pretty fair column in addition to taking to task the vulture like rip that someone else took at the football program and the new coach's attempt to do something positive.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By john griffith, 7-31-06</b>
		<p>Excellent article.  Considering the CU athletic department and football program has a new staff not associated with the "scandal", they deserve a fresh start.  It's time the Denver media look at CU's football program with an open mind instead of a narrow one.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tim, 8-01-06</b>
		<p>Thank you...Thank you...Thank you<br />
FINALLY an objective breath of fresh air from good journalist.  The CU Athletic Department deserves a new start.</p>

		<p>Jenny,<br />
You must have read my mind (not too difficult since I am your father!) but I felt the article in the Post was unfair.  Many major football programs do the same thing (including Nebraska) and are not accused of being misogynists.  What I like about your writing is no one could really clearly discern your politics (although I know)and to me that is the mark of a good journalist and keeps a reader interested.  Keep up the good work and say hello to my grandaughter!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By BEBG, 8-01-06</b>
		<p>Amen!!  Thank you not only for a fair and objective article about the Buffs, but for daring to call out the lack of journalistic integrity of one of your "peers."  It's high time for the Buffs to get the benefit of the doubt.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By jrbuff, 8-01-06</b>
		<p>what a cool dad....make sure he sees all the positive feedback you received.  go girl!!!!!!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Susan, 8-01-06</b>
		<p>Thank you for standing up to the local media that seems to be bent on finding the worst in everything.  That woman definitely has a problem.</p>

		<p>Hawkins is the real deal.  The breath of fresh air in college football.  He is a true academic who happens to coach football.  He is part of the CU athletic dept.,  and he will do wonders to help the womem's programs grow.  He was a winner at Willamette University,  Boise State,  and  many West Coast schools wish they could have had him as their coach.   CU followers are in for a fun ride. Bear Bait</p>

		<p>I could've stood to sit in on that class, I barely made it through football season as a player.(junior highschool)  I had to ask the player next to me if I was suppose to go left or right on every play because no one ever explained it to me, and they assumed I knew what to do. I still don't know much about the game.<br />
So move over ladies, there's a new kid in the class, I jsut hope I don't have to dress in drag.<br />
Hut-Hut!</p>

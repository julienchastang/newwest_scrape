							With <i>Grossology: The (Impolite) Science of the Human Body</i>, a new exhibit that opens today at the The Denver Museum of Nature & Science, the formerly venerable institution has finally succeeded in its quest to find the lowest common denominator and offer the most lowbrow possible â€œscienceâ€? exhibits permissible given its extensive taxpayer funding.  The press materials for this particular exhibit were sent to me in a barf bag with a cartoon of a young child vomiting on the front.  The press release invites us to â€œplay the pinball game â€˜Gas Attackâ€™ by scoring off bumpers dressed up as food items that cause gas.â€?  It encourages us to â€œdelve into the role of the kidney in a virtual reality experience known as â€˜Urine: The Game.â€™â€?  And it enjoins us to â€œwatch the â€˜Burp Machineâ€™ release a giant belch.â€?  The exhibitâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://dmns.org/main/en/General/Exhibitions/CurrentExhibitions/Grossology.htm" title="website">website</a> offers recipes for â€œFake Barf,â€? â€œFake Snot,â€? and â€œDookie Cookies.â€?  <br />
<br />
The subtext of this press release: Kids are ignorant, base creatures that are uninterested in science, but if we mask scientific subjects in a disgusting (and thereby kid-appealing) veneer, then maybe, just maybe, theyâ€™ll incidentally learn something.  I just disagree.  Kids deserve more respect than this.  They are naturally interested in scienceâ€”watch any kid immersed in a dinosaur exhibit for proofâ€”until the prevailing cultural message that science is hard, boring, and nerdy and Americans are hopeless at it gets crammed into their brains enough times to stick.  <i>Grossology</i> seems to contribute to this message in suggesting that all science is so unappealing that it must be delivered with an infotainment song and dance (a characteristic line from the promo material: â€œAnd you thought learning about your body was going to be boring.â€?)  Still, the <i>Grossology</i> exhibit wouldnâ€™t be such a bad thing in itself if it were not part of a larger discouraging trend that DMNS has been in of late.<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, Katy Human of the <i>Denver Post</i> reported (<a target="_blank" href="http://denverpost.com/search/ci_3060139" title="The Bible as Museum Guide">The Bible as Museum Guide</a>) that the DMNS is allowing an outside evangelical Christian organization to conduct â€œbiblically correctâ€? tours of the museum.  Rusty Carter, who leads these tours, takes the kids around the world-class dinosaur exhibit <i>Prehistoric Journey</i> and contradicts all the scientific evidence expressed in it, telling them for example that no, the world isnâ€™t 4.5 billion years old, itâ€™s a mere spring chick of 6,000 years.  Whatâ€™s more, the museum allows Carter to charge $5 a head (in addition to the museumâ€™s entry fee) to all who want to listen to him spout this B.S.<br />
<br />
This is just the latest way that DMNS has been selling out its extremely capable earth science staff for the past five years, ever since it changed its name from the Denver Museum of Natural History to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, turning away from the hard science it traditionally offered and funneling resources toward fluffy infotainment, â€œinteractiveâ€? exhibits, and even anti-science activities.  In 2002, Julie Jargon wrote an excellent overview of the entire sorry affair in <i>Westword</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.westword.com/issues/2002-09-19/news/feature.html" title="A Spaced Odyssey">A Spaced Odyssey</a>). Jargon details the way that the museum has taken on a more â€œcorporateâ€? money-focused atmosphere, and told the story of how a planned project that sounded fascinatingâ€”a natural history exhibit that focused â€œon bison evolution and the 10,000-year relationship between man and beast on the Colorado plainsâ€?â€”was shafted for a splashy space exhibit called <i>Space Odyssey</i>.  <br />
<br />
While <i>Prehistoric Journey</i> has just the right amount of â€œinteractiveâ€? components, but not so many that it overwhelmed the science it teaches, <i>Space Odyssey</i> went overboard with infotainment.  I attended the press preview of this exhibit in the summer of 2003, and most of the interactive components were broken that very evening by kids lucky enough to shoulder through crowds to take a crack at them.  I sat through an awful, unscripted amateur theater production that was supposed to give me an idea of what it was like to live on a space station.  Instead, I saw a third-rate soap opera with a handful of science tidbits sprinkled in.  I endured a moronic, kindergarten-level program in the planetarium (Whatâ€™s that huge ball?  Itâ€™s really big!  Itâ€™s Jupiter!  Better duck!)  But <i>Space Odyssey</i> brought in the money for DMNS, and thatâ€™s all they care about these days.<br />
<br />
I grew up going to the Denver Museum of Natural History many times a year, and I always loved itâ€”the dinosaur fossils, the animal dioramas, the anthropological exhibits and the rocks and minerals exhibit.  I feel attached to this institution like I do to few others in the state.  I would have thoroughly enjoyed that bison exhibit thatâ€™s now never to be.  Will any Denver kid growing up today, subjected to <i>Grossology</i>-type exhibits, create as many fond memories as I did and end up a lifelong, passionate fan of the museum?  Unless those â€œDookie Cookiesâ€? are awful tasty, it seems doubtful to me.

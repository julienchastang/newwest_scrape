<p>
	Cesar, the seventeen-year-old narrator of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mattoxroesch.com" title="Mattox Roesch">Mattox Roesch</a>&#8216;s first novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sometimes-Were-Always-Real-Same-Same/dp/1932961879/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1252941987&amp;sr=8-1" title="Sometimes We're Always Real Same-Same">Sometimes We&#8217;re Always Real Same-Same</a></I>, is badly in need of a change of scenery when the book opens.&nbsp; Cesar has grown up in Los Angeles with his Eskimo mother and white father, and he and his older brother have joined Hispanic gangs.&nbsp; &#8220;We were those chameleon kids who almost blended in but never quite did,&#8221; Cesar observes.&nbsp; Cesar&#8217;s mother decides to leave his father and L.A. behind after his brother is sent to prison for murdering two 15-year-olds who were trying to leave his gang.&nbsp; She moves with Cesar to the village she left twenty years earlier, Unalakleet, Alaska (the same village where Roesch currently lives with his family).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Cesar is focused on earning enough money to return to L.A., but his cousin, the exuberant Go-boy, does everything he can to convince him to stay.&nbsp; Through Cesar&#8217;s eyes, Roesch creates a richly detailed portrait of this town&#8212;from its plywood buildings, to its annual salmon counts, to a common malady known as &#8220;seal finger"&#8212;that is authentic and refreshingly unlike any typical depiction of Alaska.
</p>
<p>
	<I>Sometimes We&#8217;re Always Real Same-Same</I> is instantly appealing in part because it combines several classic fiction tropes: There&#8217;s the &#8220;stranger comes to town&#8221; set-up, a first-person narrator who reports the activities of a larger-than-life main character (a formula that worked for <I>The Great Gatsby</I>, <I>A Prayer for Owen Meany</I>, and countless other novels), and even a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back love story.&nbsp; Add to these elements the distinctive setting and characters in a small Alaska village, complete with its own unusual vocabulary, and Roesch has written a winner.
<br />
At first, Cesar doesn&#8217;t find the village promising.&nbsp; As he reports, Go-boy &#8220;shows me the post office, AC Store, Native Store, Igloo, the lodge, and a bunch of other plywood buildings with tin roofs.&nbsp; There are no signs or advertisements, no trees or grass lawns, and the houses are crowded under empty grids of telephone poles.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the ugliest place I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But then Cesar meets the fetching Kiana, and the village begins to look better to him.&nbsp; &#8220;I was taken by her striking cheekbones,&#8221; he reflects, &#8220;how high and chiseled they were under her mysterious, almost sad eyes.&nbsp; She had a face with the strength and danger of a hundred-foot cliff.&#8221;  Inverting the typical love story scenario, Kiana and Cesar get drunk and sleep together the first night they meet.&nbsp; Kiana turns out to be Go-boy&#8217;s adopted sister and her relationship with Cesar quickly sours; Cesar spends much of the rest of the book trying to win back her favor.
</p>
<p>
Go-boy does everything he can to make Cesar feel at home in the village, and helps him get a summer job working at a fish counting station where they look down from a tower and record the salmon rushing by in the water.&nbsp; Go-boy knows his fish, but Cesar is terrible at it, unable to distinguish between different types of salmon.&nbsp; &#8220;I had never thought about fish before we&#8217;d moved here,&#8221; Cesar reports, &#8220;But in rural Alaska fish was money&#8230;People woke up in the morning for fish.&nbsp; People stayed up all night for fish.&nbsp; There were jobs catching them and cutting them, jobs weighting them and shipping them.&nbsp; All for fish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As Cesar settles in to village life, Go-boy&#8217;s enthusiasm grows into something loonier, as his theories about religion and philosophy become increasingly disconnected from reality, he disappears for weeks at a time, publicly and incessantly declares his love for his ex-girlfriend, and begins to write letters to Yoko Ono.&nbsp; Like a lot of seventeen-year-old boys, Cesar is not always likeable&#8212;he&#8217;s selfish, even cruel at times, and he committed a reprehensible crime during his gangbanging days that he never fully owns up to.&nbsp; But he rises to the challenge of what increasingly looks like mental illness that Go-boy is suffering from.
</p>
<p>
Many parts of <I>Sometimes We&#8217;re Always Real Same-Same</I> first appeared as short stories in magazines such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.missourireview.com/content/dynamic/text_detail.php?text_id=379" title="The Missouri Review">The Missouri Review</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/spring-2008/all-way-rider" title="Narrative">Narrative</a>, and Redivider, and the only small quibble with this fine novel is that sometimes this earlier structure shows.&nbsp; The chapters often proceed backwards, beginning with a statement about something that&#8217;s already taken place, then jump into the past to explain how this happened, such as, &#8220;The day I got suspended from school, Go-boy was at home designing some crazy envelope that he claimed was our <I>ticket to heaven</I>.&#8221;  While these <I>in medias res</I> beginnings are perfect for stories, in a novel the effect is sometimes herky-jerky.
</p>
<p>
The vivid rural Alaska setting, which Roesch describes through all Cesar&#8217;s senses, serves to orient the reader and makes <i>Sometimes We&#8217;re Always Real Same-Same</I> a promising debut by a writer who is sure to have more interesting things to say.

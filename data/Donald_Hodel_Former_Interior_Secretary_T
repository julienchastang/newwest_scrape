							CU Boulder's <a href="http://www.centerwest.org" title="Center of the American West">Center of the American West</a> will bring Donald Hodel to speak on campus on Thursday, January 19 at 6 p.m. in the Eaton Humanities Building (Room 150).  Professors Patricia Limerick and Charles Wilkinson will lead Hodel in a discussion, and a reception will follow. Hodel served in the Regan administration as Secretary of the Interior from 1985 to 1989 and as the Secretary of Energy from 1982 to 1985.  According to the Center's press release, "As interior secretary, Hodel focused on energy issues and pushed to increase domestic energy porduction through the expansion of drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."  But the Center always strives for a non-partisan approach in its presentation, and further notes that "Hodel also supported the restoration of the flooded Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park."  Still, given Boulder's overwhelmingly liberal population, there might be more friendly feelings toward Hodel on stage than in the audience.

		<b>Comment By Brodie Farquhar, 1-17-06</b>
		<p>I certainly hope no one will be so rude as to mention Hodel's leadership of various conservative groups, such as the secretive Council of National Policy, of which he was president as recently as 2004.<br />
What is the CNP? <br />
Glad you asked. <br />
According to the New York Times, the CNP is â€œa few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the countryâ€? who meet â€œbehind closed doors at undisclosed locationsâ€¦to strategize about how to turn the country to the right.â€?<br />
 Who belongs? Oh, just a few names you might recognize, such as Focus on the Family founder James C. Dobson, Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation, Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association and Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform.<br />
Also some names you might not recognize, such as Foster Friess of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who according to records maintained by <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org">http://www.opensecrets.org</a> is the top donor to conservative political campaigns in Wyoming.<br />
Hodel is a political creature of the far right and knows many of the key figures linked to the Abramoff scandal -- like Norquist and Ralph Reed.</p>

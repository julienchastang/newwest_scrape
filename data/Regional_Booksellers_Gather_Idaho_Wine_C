							<p>I returned from my vacation in time to catch the final day of this year&#8217;s Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association trade show in Denver.&nbsp; At the annual trade show, independent booksellers, large and small publishers, and writers gather to talk about all aspects of the bookselling business and to introduce forthcoming titles of interest to the region.&nbsp; This year the MPIBA sponsored their first ever writer&#8217;s conference, which I found to be a unique seminar focused more on the practical business and entrepreneurial aspects of writing and publishing than any other conference I&#8217;ve attended.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll report further on the MPIBA writer&#8217;s conference soon for our series on conferences and book festivals in the West.
</p>
<p>
The troubled economy continues to hamper the publishing industry, as it does just about every other business.&nbsp; One sign of that was in the trade show hall&#8212;where publishers and writers display their books and mingle&#8212;which had fewer participants than in past years.&nbsp; But the economy hasn&#8217;t stopped writers from writing.&nbsp; According to Colorado-based Unbridled Books publisher Fred Ramey, who spoke on a writer&#8217;s conference panel, &#8220;traditional publishing houses&#8221; are publishing fewer books at the same time that self-publishers are increasing their output, resulting in his estimate of 700,000 books published annually in America.&nbsp; Speaking as someone who has a novel coming out next year, that&#8217;s a frighteningly overwhelming number of book options for people who don&#8217;t read as much as they used to.
</p>
<p>
The trade show featured a few exceptional books out of that massive output that the publishers backing them hope will stand out for readers in the West next spring.&nbsp; I came across two books that I&#8217;ll be looking forward to covering for New West next year, <I>Fire Season: Notes from a Wilderness Lookout</I> by Philip Connors (April, Ecco) and <I>West of Here</I> by Jonathan Evison (February 2011, Algonquin).
</p>
<p>
The Roundup has been on hiatus for three weeks, so now I have a bunch of book news and events to mention from my backlog of tidbits:&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>Colorado</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Denver&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.printedpagebookshop.com/" title="Printed Page Bookshop">Printed Page Bookshop</a> (1416 S. Broadway) is observing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/bannedbooksweek/index.cfm" title="Banned Books Week">Banned Books Week</a> (September 25 through October 2) with a store display of books that have been banned by various institutions and organizations. According to the Printed Page&#8217;s website, &#8220;Celebrated classics such as <I>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</I> (banned by the Denver Public Library in 1902), <I>To Kill a Mockingbird</I> and <I>The Catcher in the Rye</I> join with newer offerings such as the Harry Potter books, <I>The Kite Runner</I> and <I>The American Heritage Dictionary</I> as volumes that somebody thinks somebody else shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to read.&#8221;  The display will include one book that has never been banned.&nbsp; Visitors are invited to guess which book has not been banned for a chance to win a gift certificate for the shop.

<b>Idaho</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Writer Alan Minskoff and photographer Paul Hosefros are getting out and about these days to tell people about their new book, <I>Idaho Wine Country</I>.&nbsp; But alert New West readers already know all about it, because we featured a series of <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/idahos_indian_creek_2008_winery_of_the_year/C564/L564/" title="fine excerpts">fine excerpts</a> from the book last year.&nbsp; Bill English of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/idaho-wine-country/Content?oid=1733843" title="Boise Weekly">Boise Weekly</a> praised the book, writing,
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Beginning in December 2008, Hosefros and Minskoff crisscrossed Idaho for 15 months--in an aging Saab they christened &#8220;Bottle One"--searching for something many thought didn&#8217;t exist. Their quest, which took them as far north as Sandpoint and as far south as Marsing, yielded this extraordinary, historic book&#8230;[<I>Idaho Wine Country</I>] is the story of the search for something mystical and intoxicating. It&#8217;s an oenophile adventure that leaves the reader with the heady aftertaste of discovery.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Catch Minskoff and Hosefros Saturday, October 2 at the first annual Idaho Cooks event at the Qwest Arena in Boise (10 a.m.-6 p.m.), on Thursday, October 7 for a book signing and wine tasting at Berryhill&#8217;s in Boise (6:30-8 p.m.), on Thursday, November 4 for another book signing and wine tasting at the Snake River Winery Tasting Room in Boise, and on November 13 at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Boise (1315 N. Milwaukee St.) for a book signing (2 p.m.).&nbsp; No wine will be served with that last one, so I&#8217;d visit one of the earlier events if I were you.&nbsp; Check the <a target="_blank" href=" http://caxtonpress.com/idahowineevents.html" title="Caxton Press website">Caxton Press website</a> for more events.

<p>
<b>Utah</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.kensandersbooks.com/shop/rarebooks/index.html" title="Ken Sanders Rare Books">Ken Sanders Rare Books</a> in Salt Lake City has two special events this week.&nbsp; Tonight, author W.L. Rusho will discuss and sign his new book, <I>The Mystery of Everett Ruess</I>.&nbsp; According to Ken Sanders&#8217; website, &#8220;In 1934, Everett Ruess, a young poet, artist, vagabond disappeared into the Southern Utah desert never to be seen or heard from again. His camp, and later his mules, were found, but no trace of Ruess was ever discovered.&nbsp; Some speculated he fell or drowned in one of the remote desert canyons. Others believe he was murdered by Ute Indians or by residents of Escalante or one of the other remote towns in the region.&#8221;  The free discussion begins at 7 p.m.
</p>
<p>
On October 1, Ken Sanders Rare Books will host a reading with Craig Childs and Amy Irvine (7 p.m., free), and on October 2, Childs and Irvine will lead a workshop on the University of Utah Campus.&nbsp; Childs will discuss &#8220;Two Things You Need to Know to Write a Damn Good Story&#8221; and Irvine&#8217;s topic is &#8220;Looking For the Thing That is Both Brutal and Beautiful.&#8221; (10 a.m.-4 p.m., $75, reservations required.)
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Also in Salt Lake, at the Main Library on Saturday, October 2, Melanie Rae Thon will read from her forthcoming novel <I>The Voice of the River</I> and from her collection of short stories, <I>In This Light</I>.&nbsp; Thon grew up in Montana and now teaches in the Creative Writing and Environmental Humanities programs at the University of Utah. (7 p.m.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Wyoming</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.windbreakhouse.com/work29.htm" title="Linda M. Hasselstrom">Linda M. Hasselstrom</a>&#8216;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/little_house_on_the_prairie_with_septic_tank_troubles/C39/L39/" title="No Place Like Home: Notes from a Western Life">No Place Like Home: Notes from a Western Life</a></I>, which I reviewed last year, won the 2010 WILLA Literary Award for Creative Nonfiction, presented by Women Writing the West.&nbsp; The book is available now in paperback from the University of Nevada Press.&nbsp; Hasselstrom divides her time between South Dakota and Wyoming.
</p>
<p>
Also, a few weeks ago I mentioned that Rick Bass will be joining Benjamin Percy on the faculty of Iowa State University&#8217;s MFA Program in Creative Writing &amp; Environment.&nbsp; I just learned that Hasselstrom teaches in this program as well.&nbsp; According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://engl.iastate.edu/news_items/rick-bass-linda-hasselstrom-join-award-winning-faculty-at-isus-mfa-program-in-creative-writing-environment-1.html" title="university press release">university press release</a>:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Bass and Hasselstrom will spend several days on the ISU campus each year directing student theses, critiquing student work, and giving public lectures. In addition, they will lead MFA students in fieldwork expeditions in locations across South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. (Hasselstrom has been an affiliate faculty member for several years and has recently renewed her contract.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>

	Like many Americans, I have a complicated relationship with the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="atomic bomb">atomic bomb</a>.&nbsp; My paternal grandfather was an infantryman in World War II, who somehow survived several wounds he received in the Battle of the Bulge, the Battle of the Huertgen Forest, and other conflicts in Europe.&nbsp; When the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, he&#8217;d already received his orders to be shipped to Japan for the land invasion.&nbsp; The casualties from such an attack were projected to be massive.&nbsp; My father had not yet been conceived.&nbsp; Without the dropping of the atomic bomb to end the war, I, in all likelihood, would not exist.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
My situation is far from unique, and it poses this question: How can I be against the bomb, and yet partial to my own existence?&nbsp; Most of us avoid thinking through these sorts of unsolvable moral puzzles, so it&#8217;s fortunate that Nora Gallagher has offered an exploration of this topic in her elegant, elegiac novel <I>Changing Light</I>, set in Los Alamos, New Mexico, during the final year of World War II, when the world-renown scientists involved in the Manhattan Project were feverishly working on their &#8220;gadget.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>Changing Light</I> delves into science, theology, and New Mexico landscape and culture to tell a love story cast against the world-changing forces of history.&nbsp; Gallagher folds all these aspects into her narrative as skillfully as Graham Greene, the writer I was most reminded of as I read this book.&nbsp; The novel is set in 1945, but the prose seems as though it were generated from that era as well: bracing, intelligent, and spare. 
</p>
<p>
The novel tells the story of Eleanor Garrigue, a painter from New York married to a much older artist who had served as her mentor.&nbsp; He is now faltering in his artistic skill and jealous of his wife&#8217;s success.&nbsp; She moves away from him, to the New Mexico countryside near Santa Fe, buys land, and builds an adobe house in which to paint and escape her husband&#8217;s outsized influence.&nbsp; She&#8217;s received word that her brother Teddy has been taken as a POW by the Japanese, and she turns to prayer and attending Sunday services at the local Episcopal Church for solace.
</p>
<p>
An Episcopal priest, Bill, befriends and falls in love with Eleanor, and meanwhile, she has discovered a disoriented man by the river and takes him into her house to care for him.&nbsp; The reader learns that the man is Leo Kavan, a physicist working on the top-secret project at Los Alamos, and that he had been injured in a radiation accident at work that killed one of his colleagues.&nbsp; Members of the project are not allowed to speak to anyone outside of the group, and no civilian New Mexico residents knows what they are doing; one project member spreads a rumor to throw gossips off track that they are working on a &#8220;rocket.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
When the Nazis whom Kavan, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, had fled, look to be losing the war, he has second thoughts about whether the atomic bomb should ever be used.&nbsp; As in the best Graham Greene novels, these elements of faith, politics, and love combine to create a compelling climax to <I>Changing Light</I>.
</p>
<p>
Although the plot of this novel is gripping, my favorite part was its portraits of the landscape of New Mexico, such as in this passage when Eleanor looks out over her land after a spring snowstorm: &#8220;The snow had melted almost entirely, except under the pinions, where it lay like white skirts thrown down on the damp earth.&nbsp; Everything was still.&nbsp; The black mesa to the west seemed more deeply fixed in the earth, and the trees on the hills nearby were motionless, stiff with cold.&nbsp; Her garden looked as if a great hand had passed over it, quelling its growth.&#8221;  Throughout the novel Gallagher beautifully describes the land&#8217;s mesas, arroyos, and darting roadrunners.
</p>
<p>
Gallagher, who has previously written nonfiction books on the subject of faith, also weaves discussions of such matters into her portrayals of the characters, never offering pat answers, but rather opening up further questions in the reader&#8217;s mind, such as in this passage from the perspective of the priest:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Almost every person had a secret.&nbsp; The secret was often tied up with each person&#8217;s destiny, not to be confused with a preordained destination.&nbsp; No, it was more complex than that.&nbsp; It was as if each of us had another, deeper life than the one being lived.&nbsp; It lies underneath our ordinary days, our errands, the doing of dishes, the writing of letters, the making of money, like something moving, lobsterlike, under water.&nbsp; This only partially understood life (refused, often; banished, easily ignored) might be what we call the soul.&nbsp; The desire to know about it causes us to pray.&nbsp; But all the while, it&#8217;s moving <I>toward</I> something, as surely as we are advancing in our lives, through careers, marriage, children.&nbsp; Every now and then, this hidden life surfaces, as if to enact itself, to bring something to fulfillment.&nbsp; Often, this happens when it intersects with another&#8217;s.&nbsp; Bill had seen it happen; it was like a glimpse of things in that peculiar, vivid light after a rain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Gallagher doesn&#8217;t offer any easy answers to the moral puzzle of the atomic bomb, that terrible device that killed hundreds of thousands of people, but perhaps spared just as many.&nbsp; Although <I>Changing Light</I> is set in the last century, the questions it poses&#8212;about citizens&#8217; culpability for the actions the government carries out their name&#8212;are as fresh as ever.

		<h1>Idaho&#8217;s Daniel Orozco Signs a Two-Book Deal with Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux</h1>

							<p>About two years ago <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/western_books_i_cant_wait_to_read/C39/L39/" title="I wrote about a couple of in-the-works books">I wrote about a couple of in-the-works books</a> that I couldn&#8217;t wait to read.&nbsp; One of them, <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mac.com/zzpacker" title="Z.Z. Packer">Z.Z. Packer</a>&#8216;s eventual novel about Buffalo Soldiers, is still being written, as far as I can tell.&nbsp; But the second author I named, Daniel Orozco, just signed a two-book deal with Farrar, Strauss &amp; Giroux.&nbsp; The first of the two books, an as-yet-unnamed story collection, will be published in March of 2011.
</p>
<p>
Daniel Orozco teaches at the University of Idaho in Moscow.&nbsp; His stories have appeared in the <i>Best American Short Stories</i>, <i>McSweeney&#8217;s</i>, <i>Harper&#8217;s</i>, <i>StoryQuarterly</i>, <i>Story</i>, <i>Ecotone</i>, and elsewhere.&nbsp; In a 2008 interview with Arizona State&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asu.edu/superstitionreview/n2/interviews/danielorozco.html" title="Superstition Review">Superstition Review</a></I> Orozco explained his slow writing process:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can spend a week on a paragraph. I&#8217;ve spent a month on the first page, pondering and noodling until I nail the voice, after which things go a little faster. I spend hours poring over a thesaurus and a dictionary, making lists of words, crossing them out until I find the right one. I&#8217;ll read passages aloud, again and again and again, and again. Some writers bang out a fifty-page draft, then pare it down to the twenty pages they were looking for. My stories accrete like oysters--two pages, two-and-a-half, three, four, four-and-a-half, until I get my twenty pages.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Alan Solan&#8217;s interview with Orozco about the book deal ran in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dnews.com/story/pulse/52213/" title="Moscow-Pullman Daily News">Moscow-Pullman Daily News</a> last week.&nbsp; Solan writes, &#8220;He said he&#8217;s not really looking forward to the &#8216;traveling and publicity things&#8217; that go along with getting a book published.&#8221;

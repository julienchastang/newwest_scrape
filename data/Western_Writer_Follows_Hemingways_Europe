							<p>Regular New West contributor and Colorado-based travel writer David Frey has been off on a dream trip for several weeks, following in the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway through Europe.&nbsp; Frey is documenting it all on his blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://papasplanet.com/" title="Papa's Planet">Papa&#8217;s Planet</a>, which he is turning into a book, tentatively titled &#8220;Papa&#8217;s Planet: An Ernest Exploration of the Places Hemingway Lived and Loved.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
In <a target="_blank" href="http://papasplanet.com/?p=168" title="a presentation">a presentation</a> Frey gave last month explaining his interest in Hemingway, he wrote, &#8220;In Ernest Hemingway, there&#8217;s something we can all claim. He was a freedom-loving, communist-loving, red-white-and-blue, gun-toting nature lover who almost assuredly ate quiche.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Frey is writing detailed postcards from his Hemingway stops, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://papasplanet.com/?p=160" title="74 Rue de Cardinal Lemoine">74 Rue de Cardinal Lemoine</a> in Paris, where Hemingway and his wife Hadley lived, an interlude described in <I>A Moveable Feast</I>.&nbsp; In Spain, Frey <a target="_blank" href="http://papasplanet.com/?p=169" title="interviewed Maripaz Vega">interviewed Maripaz Vega</a>, the country&#8217;s only female bullfighter.&nbsp; He&#8217;s also been to Venice, Cuba, Key West, and Ketchum, Idaho, journeys he explains in the essay &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://papasplanet.com/?p=102" title="Why I'm Stalking Hemingway">Why I&#8217;m Stalking Hemingway</a>,&#8221; which was named a Community Keynote in the Travel Blog Exchange annual conference in New York last June.
</p>
<p>
Frey reports he&#8217;s scheduled to have an article on Hemingway&#8217;s Sun Valley in the fall issue of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunvalleymag.com" title="Sun Valley Magazine">Sun Valley Magazine</a>, &#8220;looking at the ways Sun Valley has changed since Hemingway&#8217;s day and the role he played bringing those changes about.&#8221;

&#8226; AIGA, the professional association for design, is hosting an exhibition this week in Denver of 50 outstanding recent book covers, the winners of its annual book cover design contest.&nbsp; The exhibit, &#8220;50 Books/50 Covers,&#8221; appears at the Denver Pavillions (16th and Glenarm, 2nd Level East), and is open from July 27 through July 31, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 5 - 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

<p>
&#8226; Speaking of bookish art exhibits, in September, the <a target="_blank" href="http://redshiftframing.qwestoffice.net/" title="Redshift Gallery">Redshift Gallery</a> in Denver (2266 Broadway) will present an exhibit of 40 woodcuts by Argentine artist Alfredo Benavidez Bedoya that illustrate the new book <I>The Hermaphrodite (An Hallucinated Memoir)</I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brothersgrandbois.com/daniel.asp?type=Daniel" title="Daniel Grandbois">Daniel Grandbois</a>.&nbsp; Grandbois is the author of the story collection <I>Unlucky Lucky Days</I> and is a musician in several accomplished Denver bands including Slim Cessna&#8217;s Auto Club, Tarantella, and Munly.&nbsp; The opening reception for the exhibit is on Thursday, September 9th (6-9 p.m.).&nbsp; Grandbois will read from and discuss <I>The Hermaphrodite</I> at the Tattered Cover (Colfax) next week, on August 5th (7:30 p.m.).&nbsp; Look for New West&#8217;s interview with Grandbois soon.

&#8226; One of my favorite book blogs to read is <a target="_blank" href="http://wardsix.blogspot.com/2010/06/phonebook-names.html" title="Ward Six">Ward Six</a>, the project of inventive fiction writer J. Robert Lennon (a University of Montana M.F.A. graduate, author of, most recently, the novel <i>Castle</i>) and his wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rhianellis.com/" title="Rhian Ellis">Rhian Ellis</a>, author of the novel <I>After Life</I>.&nbsp; Recently Ward Six ran a post that I thought would be of interest to New West readers, about &#8220;excellent&#8221; names Lennon <a target="_blank" href="http://wardsix.blogspot.com/2010/06/phonebook-names.html" title="found in the Missoula phone book">found in the Missoula phone book</a>.&nbsp; Combing through the phone book is a time-honored way for writers to name their characters.&nbsp; Lennon writes, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always spent a lot of time reading phonebooks. One day, there won&#8217;t be any phonebooks anymore, so we should celebrate them while we can!&#8221;  Among the Missoula residents with exemplary names are Vernon Slippy, N. Eyepopper, Spanky Scrunchly, and Fern Tiger.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
If Fern, Vernon, Mr. or Ms. Eyepopper, Spanky, or anyone else on <a target="_blank" href="http://wardsix.blogspot.com/2010/06/phonebook-names.html" title="Lennon's list of names">Lennon&#8217;s list of names</a> is reading this, send me an email and I&#8217;ll send you some kind of a prize.&nbsp; A book-shaped prize.

		<b>Comment By Dewey, 7-28-10</b>
		<p>Maybe David Frey should visit Sunlight Basin and Crandall  in northwest Wyoming , and Cooke City MT before he tops off that  global Hemingway piece.   <br />
<br />
Then again , maybe we'd like to keep our local history secrets a few decades longer....</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-28-10</b>
		<p>Dewey, <br />
<br />
Now I'm curious!  Did Hemingway hang out in Montana and Wyoming too?  Or is that all top secret?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patia, 7-28-10</b>
		<p>What a great idea for a book. I once sent myself a postcard from Hemingway House in Key West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Larry Kralj, Environmental Rangers!, 7-28-10</b>
		<p>Hemmingway loved Red Lodge.  He spent a lot of time there drinking in the bars.  Then, he spent seven weeks in St. Vincent Hospital recovering from a broken arm he recieved in a one car accident by Park City.  The nurse that attended him became the inspiration for the short story, The Gamble, the Nurse, and the Radio, or some such.  He knew Montana well.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dewey, 7-28-10</b>
		<p>Hemingway spent quite a bit of time fishing and hunting in the triangle between Cody , Cooke City, and Red Lodge in the 1920's   ( and early 30's maybe) when it was really inaccessible. He returned a few times in later years, but by then it was too " civilized" for him.<br />
<br />
Robert Hoskins has a lot of info on this phase of his life.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By David Frey, 7-29-10</b>
		<p>Yeah, Hemingway logged lots of time in Montana and Wyoming, even though Idaho gets most of the attention because that's where he bought a home and committed suicide.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the tips, folks.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mickey Garcia, 7-29-10</b>
		<p>The book could very well be called "In the Footsteps of a Manic Depressive Ego Maniac". But then again its not unusual that genius and personality disorders go hand in hand.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Anthony, 8-06-10</b>
		<p>Author and Historian Eustace Mullins (Deceased Feb/2010) has stated in several interveiws that Ernest Hemingway worked for a short time at The Moose Jaw Herald Newspaper in Moose Jaw Saskatchewan Canada in his early years. He stated that he had confirmed this with Hemingways Mentor/Editor Ezra Pound who was himself a famous author.<br />
Saskatchewan shares a border with Montana and was a Major Railway hub back in the 20's and 30's. Has anyone here ever heard anything in this regard.<br />
Thanks for any and all comments.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Kirk Giloth, 11-13-10</b>
		<p>Anthony,<br />
<br />
I have studied Hemingway for 40 years, knew and fished with his son, Jack, aka "Bumby" in his book, A Moveable Feast, about his Paris years, and know that he worked for a Toronto newspaper, after a stint on the Kansas City Star, but I've never heard of him working for the Moose Jaw Harald. I would be suspicious about a report from Ezra Pound on this rumor.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Albert, 11-20-10</b>
		<p>I am a huge Hemingway fan and I agree with the sentiment that this was a great idea for a book. Being fan of literature from him and other American authors of his time I wonder how all of the places abroad in "A Movable Feast" and "Sun Also Rises" have changed. I would imagine some places he traveled in MT, WY, and ID are still the same but perhaps the towns have become cities or resorts?</p>

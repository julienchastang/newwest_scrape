							<p>When my daughter and I look for picture books at the bookstore or library, we follow one rule: Does it look funny?&nbsp; We&#8217;re not interested in the messagey books.&nbsp; We like the weird ones that make us giggle.&nbsp; You can tell just by looking at the cover of David Wiesner&#8217;s <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780618756636" title="Art &amp; Max">Art &amp; Max</a></I></b> (Clarion Books, ages 4 to 8, 40 pages, $17.99) that it&#8217;s going to be funny, with a tall, dignified horny toad gripping brushes and a palette and standing back-to-back with a messy, bug-eyed shorter lizard against the backdrop of a saguaro-filled desert like they&#8217;re about to have a showdown.
</p>
<p>
	They do have a showdown through their artwork, in a delightful story that Wiesner tells mostly through his detailed, engaging illustrations.&nbsp; As the story opens, Arthur, the pretentious horny toad, is working on a portrait.&nbsp; The enthusiastic Max, the smaller lizard, zooms into view and announces, &#8220;I can paint too, Arthur!&#8221;  Arthur tells him, &#8220;You, Max? Don&#8217;t be ridiculous.&#8221;  When Max asks Arthur what he should paint, Arthur suggests, &#8220;Well&#8230;you could paint me.&#8221;  And Max does, literally.
</p>
<p>
	The book gets funnier with each of Max&#8217;s missteps, as Arthur turns all kinds of colors, then leaks them until he&#8217;s transparent, then unravels.&nbsp; We giggled a lot over this one, even though it does sneak a message in there: there are no rules or boundaries for creativity. <I>Art &amp; Max</I> would make a great gift for any child who loves to draw and paint.
</p>
<p>
	Another funny new picture book is <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780375867224" title="Dust Devil">Dust Devil</a></I></b> by Anne Isaacs, illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky (Schwartz &amp; Wade, ages 4-8, 48 pages, $17.99), starring Angelica Longrider, an enormous redhead who previously appeared in the Caldecott Honor Book <I>Swamp Angel</I>.&nbsp; &#8220;When Swamp Angel grew too big for Tennessee,&#8221; Isaacs writes, &#8220;she moved west to Montana, a country so sizeable that even Angel could fit in.&#8221;  What follows Angel&#8217;s arrival in Montana is a whopper of a tall tale, providing the explanations for many geographical features.
</p>
<p>
	For example, when Angel wants to block the early morning sun from waking her, she simply picks up a mountain and positions it for shade.&nbsp; &#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s a beaut,&#8217; she&#8217;d say proudly every time she set one down.&nbsp; And to this day, every stand-alone peak in Montana is called a butte.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	The illustrations of the Montana landscape with Angel dwarfing everything near her are lots of fun.&nbsp; Our favorite was one that shows her squishing a regular-sized horse that she&#8217;s trying to mount.&nbsp; Since she can&#8217;t find a horse that will hold her, Angel ends up riding a monster dust storm until she tames it into an obedient horse named Dust Devil.&nbsp; Now that she has her trusty steed, Angel is ready to wrangle with Backward Bart and his Flying Desperadoes, who &#8220;busted through Montana as fast as bad news, robbing and terrorizing everyone in their path.&#8221;  Bart is also abnormally large.&nbsp; &#8220;No one knew how much he weighed, but one day his shadow fell across a doctor&#8217;s scale and tipped the needle past 2,000 pounds.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Sheriff Napalot of Billings isn&#8217;t going to do anything to stop Bart, so Angel takes up the task.&nbsp; <I>Dust Devil</I> is a fun introduction to tall tales with a heroine who is as strong and brave she is funny.
</p>
<p>
	As Angel would tell you, there&#8217;s no room for prissy regular princesses out West, only the kind who wear hiking boots with their tiaras.&nbsp; In the latest picture book in Colorado writer Carmela LaVigna Coyle&#8217;s series that began with <I>Do Princesses Wear Hiking Boots?</I>, Coyle explores how rugged princess girls amuse themselves during playdates.&nbsp; Naturally, mud is involved.&nbsp; In <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781589795426" title="Do Princesses Have Best Friends Forever?">Do Princesses Have Best Friends Forever?</a></I></b> illustrated by Mike Gordon and Carl Gordon (Taylor Trade Publishing, 32 pages, $15.95, ages 4-8), the princess in hiking boots invites her best friend over to play.&nbsp; &#8220;Are you a princess just like me?&#8221; she asks her friend.&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a princess since I was three!&#8221;  They play dress up for a while, then make a mess in the living room, leap barefoot through the mud in the back yard, and hose down the little brother and dog.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	The princess&#8217;s mother, perhaps figuring they&#8217;ve torn apart the house enough for one day, packs the kids up for a visit to the zoo.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it&#8217;s craft time.&nbsp; &#8220;Let&#8217;s make two bracelets with a double pink heart.&nbsp; And then we can wear them when we&#8217;re apart.&#8221;  The book comes with two pink paper bracelets for friends to share.&nbsp; My daughter wants to keep them in the book, so she just ooches her hand underneath to try them on.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
No matter what the spell checker says, &#8220;ooches&#8221; <I>is</I> an actual word&#8212;I learned it from a Richard Scarry book.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s the kind of silly learning any kid will enjoy from these three new picture books.

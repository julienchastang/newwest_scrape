							After beautifully pulling off the bureaucratically-complicated <i>The Gates</i> in Central Park in February, artist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net" title="Christo">Christo</a> should be in a good bargaining position when he and his wife and business partner Jeanne-Claude come to Colorado next week to plead their case for <i>Over The River</i>, a project in which they will build a â€œshimmeringâ€? cloth canopy over a section of the Arkansas River near CaÃ±on City. One good sign for Cristo: the lunch sacks handed out to Bolder Boulder participants this year were made of cloth in <i>The Gates</i>â€™ signature saffron color.<br />
<br />
According to Mark Arnest of the Colorado Springs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1309233&secid=1" title="Gazette">Gazette</a>, drawings and plans for Christoâ€™s <i>Over The River</i> have been displayed at Salidaâ€™s Steam Plant Theater for several weeks, and on August 1st, the artist himself will be on hand to discuss the project and answer questions from the audience. The Q&A session with the public might be the easiest part of Christo and Jeanne-Claudeâ€™s ten-day Colorado trip, howeverâ€”theyâ€™ll spend the rest of it wrangling with state and local government officials over permits.  Christo first proposed <i>Over The River</i> in 1992, and was of course met with all sorts of opposition and bureaucratic hurdles, but as Calvin Tomkinsâ€™ March 2004 <i>New Yorker</i> profile made clear, the artist considers the fuss over his projects to be part of the art. <br />
<br />
Coloradoans should feel pride because the internationally-famous artist chose our state for its beauty, right? Not according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/otr.html" title="Christo's website">Christo's website</a>, which lists more pragmatic concerns: â€œFor the project, a river had to be chosen. That river should have high banks so that steel cables could be suspended, a road running continuously along the river, as well as both white and tranquil waters used for rafting.â€?  And we thought he loved us.<br />
<br />
One of the opposition leaders Arnest quotes in his article is John Stansfield, an environmentalist and Sierra Club chairman who doesnâ€™t see why Christo should add anything to an area thatâ€™s  â€?already remarkable and beautiful.â€?  Stansfield does make an interesting pointâ€”while heâ€™s in the neighborhood, maybe Christo could drape some local eyesores in shimmering cloth.  There are the hideous bronze statues of children that mar various parts of Boulderâ€™s Pearl Street Mall and the repellant statue in Denverâ€™s Cherry Creek outdoor mall of a Native American being impaled by a sharp-beaked eagle. Christo could wrap Willville--the pair of CU dorms that are Boulderâ€™s only high-rise buildings--in colors that complement the Flat Irons. If thereâ€™s any cloth left over, maybe he could wrap Representative Tom Tancredoâ€™s mouth.<br />

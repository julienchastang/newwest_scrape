		<h1>First Novels Belong in the Basement: Against Self-Publishing</h1>
		<h2><i>New West Books editor Jenny Shank offers five simple rules for publishing.</i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 4-08-09</p>
			
			
							<p>A few months ago, my parents got a letter in the mail from the <a target="_blank" href="http://centerwest.org/" title="Center of the American West">Center of the American West</a> that said I was invited to a banquet and the organizers wanted to give me some more money for a writing prize I&#8217;d won ten years ago.&nbsp; Back then, I was in grad school in Boulder and I was working on my first novel, which I entered in the Center&#8217;s first annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org/academics/write/index.php" title="Thompson Awards">Thompson Awards</a> for Western American Writing competition.&nbsp; There was no page limit, so instead of selecting a few chapters, I actually sent the entire manuscript I had at the time, and some poor souls apparently read 250 of my pages and gave me one of the prizes, perhaps as a nod to my audacity.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The Thompson family increased the awards over the last decade and they want to give us early winners more money to make up for the difference, bless them.&nbsp; Extra money for no additional work?&nbsp; Sure, I&#8217;ll take it.&nbsp; But I have already earned my reward, because my first novel is sitting in my basement, where it should be.
</p>
<p>
In fact, let&#8217;s make that a rule:
</p>
<p>
<b>1) Every house should have a first novel in its basement.</b>
</p>
<p>
It gives the home ballast.&nbsp; It lends the basement the appropriate air of mystery, history, and parental dreams deferred that all basements should have.&nbsp; The longer the book, the better.&nbsp; Epic works of over 400 pages, like mine, really serve to anchor a house.
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s why the proliferation of self-publishing makes me uneasy.&nbsp; It robs future basements of their unbound novels, hastily stuffed into over-sized manila envelopes.&nbsp; There are lots of options for people looking to self-publish these days&#8212;CreateSpace, BookSurge, Lulu.&nbsp; It couldn&#8217;t be easier or more convenient.&nbsp; But I suggest that if you can&#8217;t find a publisher for your novel, instead of self-publishing, give it to a neighbor who doesn&#8217;t have a novel in his basement.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Whatever you do, don&#8217;t self-publish and then send the book to me for review.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Blogs are great vehicles for unedited self-expression, as are newsy Christmas letters, and even self-published nonfiction books on overly specific topics, such as the mating habits of Red-winged Blackbirds in Northern Colorado, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/main/article/boulder_birds_worthy_of_hitchcock/" title="about which I know a little.">about which I know a little.</a> 
</p>
<p>
But first novels belong in the basement.&nbsp; There&#8217;s got to be something frightening for the children to discover, some reason for them to dare each other to go down there. 
</p>
<p>
I was 21 when I started writing my first novel.&nbsp; Just a kid.&nbsp; I should have been out drinking, but I had grand ambitions.&nbsp; I gave it some awful title derived from a phrase in the Bible.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s make that a rule, too: 
</p>
<p>
<b>2) All first novels should have titles derived from the Bible and/or Shakespeare.</b>
</p>
<p>
The manuscript should be placed in a spot of the basement that&#8217;s prone to flooding, because a flood hitting the manuscript on which you wasted your youth is kind of biblical, which goes along with the title.&nbsp; And using a title from the Bible or Shakespeare is also Faulknerian.&nbsp; Everyone starting out of the blocks thinks they&#8217;re going to be Faulkner.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to, or you wouldn&#8217;t start at all.
</p>
<p>
My novel concerned a girl&#8217;s high school basketball team in Denver.&nbsp; But it didn&#8217;t stop there.&nbsp; I decided to cram the entire modern history of Denver into it, for good measure.&nbsp; I did a lot of research.&nbsp; I went to libraries and looked at newspaper articles on microfilm or microfiche&#8212;I get those ancient technologies confused.&nbsp; I ordered dissertations through inter-library loan.&nbsp; There was one dissertation about Denver&#8217;s history of busing for racial integration that was so fine I had planned to thank its author on my acknowledgments page.&nbsp; (Don&#8217;t mock: you&#8217;ve planned out your acknowledgment page, too, or your Oscar acceptance speech or your post-game interview with ESPN or the heartfelt way you&#8217;ll thank Terry Gross or Oprah for finally having you on the show.)  
</p>
<p>
I would thank the author of that dissertation here if all of my notes for my first novel hadn&#8217;t been lost in the transfer three computers ago.&nbsp; They might be on some ancient storage device that I can no longer access, like a floppy disk, the very name of which brings me a rush of nostalgic glee.&nbsp; Technology&#8217;s relentless march is yet another reason why you should print out your first novel, once, and place it in the basement.
</p>
<p>
Every so often, you&#8217;ll be struck by idea that maybe your novel isn&#8217;t as bad as you remember.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve got to keep it in the basement, so you can go down there, read a few pages, and disabuse yourself of that notion.
</p>
<p>
Some first novels are great, and they sail right through the publishing process, into bookstores and touch the hearts of millions.&nbsp; But most first novels belong in the basement.&nbsp; Most of us have to keep writing past the point where we&#8217;ve lost all hope to make something happen, to keep writing when you no longer have any time or any reasonable reason to continue doing what you&#8217;re doing.&nbsp; The more broken and hopeless you become, the more cynical you get, and cynicism can be funny.&nbsp; Because first novels are written before you&#8217;ve really started to fail, they often take themselves too seriously.&nbsp; I say, marinate in your failure until you&#8217;re properly cynical because, here comes rule three:
</p>
<p>
<b>3) Cynicism can be funny.&nbsp; And that will make your second novel better.</b>
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s move right along to rule four:
</p>
<p>
<b>4) If you value your marriage, don&#8217;t make your spouse read your first novel.</b>
</p>
<p>
No good can come of that.&nbsp; If he says, &#8220;It&#8217;s great, Honey,&#8221; you&#8217;ll know he&#8217;s lying just to avoid upsetting you.&nbsp; If he says, &#8220;It needs some work,&#8221; you&#8217;ll agree with him but silently, you&#8217;ll seethe, remembering that one great metaphor you had on page 67.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
One last rule:
</p>
<p>
<b>5) Just because you might have won a prize for your first novel or had a chapter of it published in some journal, that doesn&#8217;t mean it shouldn&#8217;t stay in the basement.</b> 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;ll feel more comfortable down there in the basement with a few laurels to rest on.
</p>
<p>
So with my first novel lodged happily in my basement, near the window well that might run over with spring thaw at any moment, I&#8217;ll head to the Thompson Award banquet later this month and enjoy myself as I reminisce about the novel of my youth.
<br />

		<p>Shoot Jenny, you've completely shattered my plan. Self-publish a first draft novel about overcoming. Send the three hundred and three page novel to Oprah to discover. Bask in the glory of modern media charmed by my backstory. Receive an exceptionally large advance on my next novel and, of course, my highly anticipated memoir filled with more overcoming. Buy some land near a little know but stunningly wild and beautiful National Forest and live the rest of my days in peace and comfort and wonderment. Oh well, I guess writing is actually work. Who would have thought. Guess, I'll try my hand at graphic novels complete with my own stick man, sorry stick person, drawings. Next stop Hollywood and glory. At the Oscar's,  I'll be sure and include you along with my agent, gopher, and other assorted members of my real west posse. Now, let's talk about slapping that first novel of yours between some leather so you too can become a personality. Whoopie tie yay.<br />

		<p>My basement is the scariest place in North America. It has four unpublished novels!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Allen Jones, 4-08-09</b>
		<p>By and large, seems like most second and even third novels deserve a place in that basement as well. The only way fiction can justify itself is by being extraordinary, and the only way to succeed at that level is to fail, and fail, and fail, until finally you can hit one out of the park. Perhaps because the art and craft of fiction lies in making it look easy, in making the reading experience effortless, most writers assume, starting out, that it must actually BE easy. But good rule of thumb: If it's easy write, it's probably not worth reading.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Melanie, 4-08-09</b>
		<p>But wait. What if you don't have aspirations to be Faulkner, but instead aspire to be Nora Roberts? Or maybe not even Nora Roberts, but someone a few rungs lower on that particular totem pole? Then I would say the opposite should apply. The more nauseatingly hopeful and sweeping your work of fiction is, the better your chances for publishing, right? Right? Please say I'm right.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Pokocky, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Sorry to say but your post anchors itself in the idea to go for the prize.<br />
Not only that but you do not mention anywhere your credentials as a expert on the publishing industry and as a writer.<br />
So what am I to conclude.  I will reserve my comments on that.<br />
What is important to anyone reading this is that there will always be someone out there that is so believable  that one might just take their advice.  The newbie novelist is desperate for attention and desires to be the next Hemingway. <br />
What about writing because you like to write?  What about talking about the joys you experienced as a writer?  Why not talk about the hard work and the idea that writing if taken seriously is a profession with no guarantees of ever getting paid?  Why talk about yourself and your prize and then devaluing the very thing that motivated you to continue on in one of the most dreaded hardest professions out there?<br />
Perhaps you can write a post to answer some of my questions as an update or part II to this post where you get to tell us the life of a writer like yourself.  Aren't you happy you are a writer and does it not all boil down at the end of the day all a writer wants is to be read?<br />
Kindest,<br />
Michael</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Thanks for your comments, everybody.  Melanie--you're right, cynicism will not help people with aspirations to write hopeful, sweeping books.  But maybe cynicism will help you figure out what sorts of stuff fans of these kinds of books are suckers for, so you can produce that?<br />
<br />
Michael P.: as for credentials on the writing and publishing industry, I have none.  Except that I read a lot.  A couple of books a week.  But I am an "expert" in nothing.  So don't listen to me, follow your dreams, man.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Clive Warner, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Oh yes, I totally agree. My own first novel was dreadful. The second one not bad but not publishable. Often it is the third novel that gets published. Then your fourth one comes out and you look at the third one with the benefit of added time and think, oh hell, it should have been better ...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Ev Bishop, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Dear Jenny,<br />
<br />
Great post and great affirmation.   Sometimes I feel a bit of guilt about my basement novel--did I give up on it too quickly?  And then I remember all of its vehement, heartfelt messages....  ;-D  <br />
<br />
I didn't feel you were trying to come of as some expert (yet there _is_ wisdom in your humour), or that you were saying we should all wanna be Faulkners.  I felt you obviously loved writing and knew the process, but without delusion and with just enough cynicism to make me laugh (and relate!) hard. <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;But maybe cynicism will help you figure out what sorts of stuff fans of these kinds of books are suckers for, so you can produce that?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Still laughing. <br />
<br />
Have a good day.</p>

		<p>My basement has one finished first novel and I do believe it's adding to the resell value of my home and the chagrin of future offspring.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Fawn, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Well, I don't HAVE a basement, but I seemed to have hit the Shakespearean title mark.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By problembear, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>one of the nicest things about saving documents in computer hard drives and sending the words electronically to potential publishers is not the easy access for the author,  but the savings in paper...<br />
<br />
and the avoidance of accidentally being read by an innocent bystander who does not deserve the affliction of bad fiction...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By mbartley, 4-09-09</b>
		<p>Jenny, your response to Michael P made my day. "I have none," "I read a lot," "I am an expert in nothing," how honest, funny, and refreshing you are. By the way, I read your story in the Amazon first book contest. You may not be an "expert" but you sure are a helluva storyteller. In my previous comment I joked about you slapping that first novel between leather. I do look forward to reading whatever work you should have published because I find your voice authentic and interesting. Good luck and keep on grinding.<br />

		<p>Proud to be a member in good standing of First Novel in the Basement crowd. And by the look of things, that spring thaw is going to be a whopper. I see hundreds, maybe thousands, of first novels floating out of Boulder and Cheyenne and Billings basements and down Eastern Slope watersheds into the Mighty Mississipp, where they will comingle and and become one gigantic epic novel which will soak up all the water, clog the waterway somewhere near New Orleans and be declared the nation's largest navigational hazard. People will be clamoring to read our waterlogged prose. Or string us up. At long last, all of us basement novel authors will be featured on cable news.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jill Kuraitis, 4-11-09</b>
		<p>Since we don't have basements in bedrock-Boise, is it okay to bury the First Novel in the dog's grave? That way at least he'd have something to read, however awful.<br />
<br />
And it's awful.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-11-09</b>
		<p>Yes, provided the dog and the book die at the same time.  I don't advise disinterment.<br />
<br />
And you too Jill?  The novel-writing plague is more rampant than I'd guessed...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Kitty, 4-11-09</b>
		<p>There was a time when I pictured myself promoting my book on TV -- Phil Donahue's old show I think. In my daydream, I was wearing faded blue jeans and a pale pink v-neck cashmere sweater. But that was 1985, and even I knew that my first book was dreadful. After 20 years of struggling through rewrites, syllable by syllable, I had produced, according to a friend, "62 pages of horseshit." I've scuttled the book -- for now, maybe forever.<br />
<br />
I never really looked at fame as a goal in and of itself. Actually, I prefer semi-seclusion. But I've always wanted to 1)write a complete something, and 2)get published. Since I had so much trouble with a novel, I decided to try my hand at short stories. I see life in vignettes anyway, so it seemed natural.<br />
<br />
I wrote 10 very short stories. The shortest is 600 words; the longest is 2,467 and is the only story that tops 2,000 words. <br />
<br />
I wanted to give my mother my stories in book form -- with a cover and a spine and pictures and even a bio in the back. Using a 5"x8" unlined note pad of paper, I printed a copy on my computer. I slathered on tacky glue with a baby's toothbrush to bind it together. It took about 2 hours to print, page by page, and about 2 days to completely dry. <br />
<br />
I was very proud of my book, so much so that I eventually printed a total of 6 copies. I gave them to family and a couple of friends and facetiously told them they could be collector's items some day.<br />
<br />
One friend loved it; she even said she was a bit envious, which is hilarious because she has published several books with honest-to-goodness publishers. She's done well enough to buy a house with a couple of her books. The other friend thanked me but didn't even bother saying they were horseshit.<br />
<br />
With the exception of my mother, my family said nothing. My mother never really commented on my writing other than to question my sense of propriety. "I was shocked that you wrote about a woman prostituting herself. Where on earth would you ever get such an idea?"<br />
<br />
It's been three-plus years and I still like my stories, even if no one else does. <br />
<br />
I love the process of writing, so I haven't given up on my dream of getting published. Maybe if I took up drinking and smoking, maybe my writing would improve. Whadda'ya think?<br />
<br />
...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By jim Salestrom, 4-14-09</b>
		<p>Dear Jenny,<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed your story... I laughed out loud.<br />
I look forward to reading your past / future contributions.<br />
<br />
I am a musician from Colorado and find this to be true about songwriting too.<br />
If I had a nickel for every song someone has sent me to pitch to someone I used to work for, I'd have a bunch of nickels.<br />
The basement wouldn't be large enough to hold all the rejected songs I've written ... some that I thought were pretty good.<br />
We also have an attic.<br />
Thanks for your insight.<br />
p.s.- I'm working on a story of my life as a sideman musician.... would it be too much to ask, if you had a little time....?<br />
<br />
This probably applies to my 1st Book-On-Tape too.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Basement flooding, 8-19-11</b>
		<p>Research shows that almost 100% of all basements will suffer some form of basement flooding at some point in their existence.  “Almost 100%” translates into “it’s certain”.  It makes sense, too, because basements are the single lowest location in any structure, and excess water is always going to flow downhill.  Put the two together and you have an unwelcome flooded basement.</p>

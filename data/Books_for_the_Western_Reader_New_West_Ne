							Itâ€™s the time of year when just about every publication seems to roll out its best-of-the-year lists for books. And, as usual, as most major publications are based on the east coast, very few books that have anything to do with the West make the cut.  In <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/books/review/notable-books2005.html?ex=1134622800&en=a5eb14b94a0859a6&ei=5070" title="100 Notable Books of the Year">100 Notable Books of the Year</a>, I counted two fiction books set in the Western U.S. (Walter Kirnâ€™s <i>Mission To America</i>, set in Utah, and Cormac McCarthyâ€™s <i>No Country For Old Men</i>, set in Texas), one nonfiction title that was written by a western writer, though itâ€™s set mostly in New York (â€œThe Tender Barâ€? by J.R. Moehringer, who lives in Denver), and one more that is set in California (â€œOh The Glory of it Allâ€? by Sean Wilsey).<br />
<br />
To make up for this lack of year-end recommended Western reading, Iâ€™m going to list a few of the best Western books that I read this year.  Bear in mind that this is a biased sample, derived from the forty books that I happen to have read this year (yes, I am slightly obsessive compulsive about books, and I keep lists of what Iâ€™ve read).  If anyone has more Western books to recommend for 2005, please add them in the comments section.<br />

<b>Carol Shields: Collected Stories</b><br />
Grove Press, 516 pages, $25<br />
<b>Western Connection:</b> Okay, this is stretching the geography a bit, but many of Shieldsâ€™ stories are set in Western Canada, especially in the Vancouver area.<br />
<b>What I Loved:</b> Shields, who died of cancer in 2003, was often known as the most â€œdomesticâ€? of the three great contemporary Canadian female writers (Alice Munro and Margaret Atwood are the others).  In reading all her stories in this collection, however, I found that her work is far more mysterious and unexpected than I would have imagined. The stories are funny, delightful, and often moving.  <br />

<br />
<b>Local Wonders: Seasons in the Bohemian Alps</b> by Ted Kooser<br />
University of Nebraska Press, 153 pages, $10.95<br />
<b>Western Connection:</b> The author, the current U.S. poet laureate, lives in and writes about the Nebraska landscape.<br />
<b>What I Loved:</b> Iâ€™m cheating a bit with this one, as the book was published in 2002, but I only discovered it this year.  Kooser writes lovely prose, full of wry humor and affection for the land and its people.  The book is organized by season, and Kooser has a great many ideas and images to share about the different times of year on the Nebraska prairie.  But what really won me over were astute observations like this one, from the â€œAutumnâ€? section: â€œThere are a lot more Halloween decorations on houses in Lincoln and in the surrounding towns than I remember people having in previous years.  Even orange icicles!  A couple of years ago strings of electrically illuminated plastic icicles were introduced as new Christmas decorations.  People festooned them from their eaves.  Unlike real icicles, they had staggered branches like little bolts of lightning, but apparently they were successful even though they didnâ€™t look much like real icicles, so successful the manufacturers have apparently decided to mix orange dye into the molds, hoping to pick up a little Halloween business.  Once again we have carried things a little too far.â€?<br />
<br />
<b>Sky Bridge</b> by Laura Pritchett<br />
Milkweed Editions, 304 pages, $22<br />
<b>Western Connection:</b> The book is set in eastern Colorado and the author lives near Ft. Collins.<br />
<b>What I Loved:</b> In this simple, compelling tale of a young rural woman who is forced to raise her sisterâ€™s infant with little help from anyone, Pritchett paints a full picture of a small town in eastern Colorado and the lives of people in it.<br />

<br />
<b>The Tender Bar</b> by J.R. Moehringer<br />
Hyperion, 368 pages, $23.95<br />
<b>Western Connection:</b> The author is a Denver-based journalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and part of the book takes place in Arizona.<br />
<b>What I Loved:</b> Iâ€™ve got to agree with the <i>New York Times</i> on this oneâ€”<i>The Tender Bar</i> is a wonderful, funny memoir about Moehringerâ€™s unconventional upbringing in Manhasset, New York.  After his father abandoned him, the men at the local bar took him under their collective wing.<br />
For my complete review, see <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_4065743,00.html" title="'Bar' a memoir worth toasting">'Bar' a memoir worth toasting</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Zorro</b> by Isabel Allende<br />
Harper Collins, 400 pages, $25.95<br />
<b>Western Connection:</b> The book is partially set in California, where Allende lives.<br />
<b>What I Loved:</b> <i>Zorro</i> was just a fun summer readâ€”Allende wrote the book in an old-fashioned style, and she brings the exploits of the famous avenger to life better than most filmmakers and writers who have tackled Zorroâ€™s story over the years.<br />
For my complete review, see <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_3755704,00.html" title="A cut above: Allende's 'Zorro'">A cut above: Allende's 'Zorro'</a>.<br />
<br />
Iâ€™d also like to recommend the entire <a href="http://unp.unl.edu/" title="University of Nebraska Press">University of Nebraska Press</a> catalogue to Western readersâ€”itâ€™s brimming with books Iâ€™d like to find the time to read, such as those in the â€œFlyover Fictionâ€? series, which â€œwill focus on work set in the center of the country,â€? or its rich slate of books set in the West.

		<b>Comment By Brian Kenny, 12-13-05</b>
		<p>Rebecca Solnit's A Field Guide to Getting Lost contains some western landscape and ideas about use of wilderness</p>
		
		<b>Comment By secondtear, 12-13-05</b>
		<p>I heard an NPR interview today with Denver poet Robert Cooperman.   He read from his book The Widowâ€™s Burden.  It sounded fantastic!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By sherouse, 12-19-05</b>
		<p>Part One of Jared Diamond's _Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed_, is "Modern Montana," an extended analysis of the state and its current challenges. Montana figures also in some of the book's later chapters, particularly Part Four, "Practical Lessons."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Paul Matteucci, 12-21-05</b>
		<p>OK Jenny.  These are probably good--but a little bit chick-ee I think.  Anything for real men?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 12-22-05</b>
		<p>Paul,<br />
Actually, several of these books are of the hairy-chested variety, especially "The Tender Bar," which is all about men hanging out among men in a bar, talking about manly things and drinking like men.  <br />
<br />
And our you calling Ted Kooser, the nation's poet laureate, a chick?  Well, he's pretty skinny so you could probably take him in a fight, but his book definitely will appeal to men (I know because my mom sent a copy of it to each of her seven brothers and they all loved it). Though he isn't even a middleweight, Kooser does manly stuff in the book like constructing a new outhouse for himself because he prefers to relieve himself in the great outdoors.  If that isn't manly, I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm in the middle of reading this terrific new book by Reg Saner called "The Dawn Collector: On My Way to the Natural World."  I plan to do a full review of it in a few weeks, but basically, Saner writes about his experiences hiking in the Colorado wilderness, and there's none of that New Age-y mysticism of the natural world that would scare off some he-men such as yourself.  Saner writes about cougars, encounters with Boulder (human) nutcases, and just very specific, clear, brainy prose about the natural world.  This book is the second in the series "Center Books on the American West" published by the Center for American Places in Santa Fe.<br />
<br />
And if you were really manly, you'd be man enough to read a book written by a woman!  "Zorro" might appeal more to a feminine audience, but those other two should appeal to everybody.</p>

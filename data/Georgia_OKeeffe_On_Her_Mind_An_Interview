							<p><I>Novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelizacampbellsite.com/" title="Liza Campbell">Liza Campbell</a> grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, about forty miles from Santa Fe, where her debut novel and first published work of fiction, </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thepermanentpress.com/p-282-the-dissemblers.aspx" title="The Dissemblers">The Dissemblers</a><I>, is set.&nbsp; Campbell studied English at Wellesley College and earned an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of San Francisco.&nbsp; After that, she moved to Boulder to work for VeloPress &#8220;and to pursue my dreams of being a hardcore endurance athlete,&#8221; she says.&nbsp; &#8220;Thank goodness I&#8217;ve grown out of that stage,&#8221; she adds.&nbsp; Campbell left Boulder to live in Bozeman for a couple of years, and then returned to Colorado to attend nursing school.&nbsp; </I>The Dissemblers<I> (The Permanent Press, 199 pages, $28) is an elegantly crafted, introspective novel that tells the story of a young painter named Ivy Wilkes who moves to Santa Fe to work at the Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe Museum.&nbsp; O&#8217;Keeffe is Ivy&#8217;s artistic idol, and Ivy becomes frustrated that her own paintings can&#8217;t compare to O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s.&nbsp; When a friend suggests she try copying O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s work for profit, Ivy puts aside her moral qualms and plunges into the world of art forgery.&nbsp; Liza Campbell will discuss </I>The Dissembers<I> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://boulderbookstore.indiebound.com/event/liza-campbell-dissemblers" title="Boulder Book Store">Boulder Book Store</a> on Wednesday, December 8 at 7:30 p.m. (I should note that we share the same publisher&#8212;The Permanent Press will publish my novel, </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jennyshank.com/the-ringer" title="The Ringer">The Ringer</a><I>, in March.)</I>

<p>
<b>New West: Growing up in New Mexico, were you aware of Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s art since you were a kid?&nbsp; Are you as big an admirer of O&#8217;Keeffe as Ivy is?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Liza Campbell:</b> I was only loosely aware of O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s work.&nbsp; Primarily, I had seen her famous paintings of skulls with flowers, which are not my favorite.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really become familiar with her work until after I started writing the book, but the more I learned about her the more I admired her.&nbsp; So I would say yes, now I am as big of an O&#8217;Keeffe admirer as Ivy is, but that came through writing the book. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Of the many places you&#8217;ve lived, why did you decide to set your first novel in New Mexico?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> Writing a book set in New Mexico was partially a way to express my own love for the state, and partially a way to prudently follow the advice to write what you know. I lived in New Mexico until I was seventeen, and honestly I&#8217;ve been homesick ever since I left.&nbsp; I started writing about New Mexico in an autobiography class I was taking for school, and realized that it was very inspiring place for me.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did the idea for the plot of <I>The Dissemblers</I> first occur to you?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> I was at an art museum with my parents, and was quite taken with a Van Gogh painting.&nbsp; I stood admiring the painting for some time, and then realized that in addition to feeling moved by the beauty of the painting, I felt a little jealous of the painter.&nbsp; I was envious of Van Gogh because I could never make a painting that beautiful!&nbsp; (Ridiculous, I know.)  That was when the character of Ivy began to take shape for me.&nbsp; She loves O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s work, but is not satisfied by just looking at the paintings; she wants the painting to be her own.&nbsp; The plot grew naturally out of Ivy&#8217;s personality (and flaws).
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What was your process of writing this book?&nbsp; How long did it take?&nbsp; Had you written other novels before this one was published?&nbsp; Do you also write short stories?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> From beginning to end, the novel took about three and a half years to write.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t write it chronologically; rather, I knew the basic outline of the novel and would write whatever scene of the book I felt particularly excited about at the time.&nbsp; Then at the end, I cobbled them all together and smoothed out the transitions as much as possible.&nbsp; Incidentally, I would not recommend this approach to writing a book, and will probably not write that way again!&nbsp; This was my first novel.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never seriously written short stories, and actually find short stories much more intimidating as an art form than novels.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I enjoyed the observation, &#8220;In old group photos, you could pick Georgia out right away, not as a beauty, but as a self-sufficient presence.&#8221;  Do you think Ivy is a self-sufficient presence as the book opens, or does she still have a way to go to achieve that?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> Thank you!&nbsp; At the beginning of the book, Ivy has a long way to go in order to achieve self-sufficiency.&nbsp; Although she is very independent, even somewhat of a loner, she is very affected by other peoples&#8217; opinions.&nbsp; At the opening of the book, her ideas of success and achievement are largely defined by the approval of others; over the arc of the story, I think that begins to change a little.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: It doesn&#8217;t seem like Ivy is motivated by money when she decides to make the fake O&#8217;Keeffes.&nbsp; She seems to want to use it as a test of her artistic abilities.&nbsp; Also, she gives up on her own ability to create an original painting.&nbsp; O&#8217;Keeffe had not done any of her best work by the time she was Ivy&#8217;s age&#8212;why do you think Ivy ignores Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s example and gives up on herself at this young age?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> When Ivy begins her work in forgery, she doesn&#8217;t yet know the toll that it will take on her own original work.&nbsp; She even thinks it might be a way to find inspiration.&nbsp; By the time she realizes that she has lost her own voice, she is thoroughly entangled in the forgery mess.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re right that Ivy does exhibit a certain impatience at the beginning of the book.&nbsp; She doesn&#8217;t want to wait through years of hard work and insignificance to make her mark on the art world.&nbsp; Part of her growth is in realizing &#8211; even embracing &#8211; that the process of art is more important than the product or the recognition.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: One of the themes of <I>The Dissemblers</I> is selfishness versus selflessness.&nbsp; Ivy considers herself too selfish to grow up, really, to have kids or do anything other than look out for herself.&nbsp; By contrast, she reflects on O&#8217;Keeffe, &#8220;Georgia&#8217;s later works are all unsigned, unclaimed flowers and landscapes.&nbsp; As if she didn&#8217;t crave ownership, but was only reporting what she saw.&nbsp; As if a signature were selfish.&#8221;  Were you conscious of this theme as you wrote the novel?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> That&#8217;s an interesting question!&nbsp; I was loosely aware that most of my characters were fundamentally selfish people, but I didn&#8217;t intentionally make that a theme.&nbsp; I do think that it is one of the eternal questions about art, though &#8211; is all art intrinsically selfish?&nbsp; Does art play a role in the greater good of society, or does it just promote the satisfaction of the artist?&nbsp; I go back and forth on that question.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You wrote <I>The Dissemblers</I> in first-person from Ivy&#8217;s perspective, interspersed with some third-person sections describing episodes from the life of Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe.&nbsp; Most of these sections focus on O&#8217;Keeffe as a young woman.&nbsp; Why did you decide to portray her as a young woman, when she hadn&#8217;t yet done her best-known work?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> Because Ivy is just starting out as an artist, I wanted to focus on O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s experiences when she was just starting out.&nbsp; I suspect there is a difference between being an unknown artist and being a celebrated artist.&nbsp; When nobody knows your work, nobody except you really cares whether or not you paint.&nbsp; The motivation to paint seems more pure, or at least more personal, when the artist is doing it for herself.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Many of Ivy&#8217;s thoughts seem applicable to writing as well as painting.&nbsp; For example, you write, &#8220;When you stop painting, the hardest thing in the world is to start again.&nbsp; This is why painters become compulsive about their routine.&nbsp; Missing one day may not paralyze you, but if you miss a week you are terrified that you will never paint again.&#8221;  Do you think this is true of writing, too?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve spent many a day worrying that I will never be able to write again!
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Do you paint, and if not, did you research the sections about painting?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> I am a tragically bad artist.&nbsp; I did take one drawing class in school, but for this book I spent a lot of time talking to painters and asking them silly questions.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you do any other research for this novel?&nbsp; Did you spend a lot of time at the O&#8217;Keeffe museum?&nbsp; That&#8217;s one of my favorite museums in the world&#8212;and I think my favorite thing in there is the display of her used paints, brushes, and charcoals that are how she left them.&nbsp; What is your favorite part of the O&#8217;Keeffe museum?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> I read letters and journal entries by O&#8217;Keeffe (which were infinitely more useful than any critical analysis of her work).&nbsp; And yes, I did make several trips to the very wonderful O&#8217;Keeffe museum.&nbsp; Besides the art (my favorite paintings are from her Pelvis series) my favorite thing about the museum is the architecture.&nbsp; I love how enormously tall the doors are &#8211; it is like going into a church.&nbsp; There is also something home-like about the layout of the museum.&nbsp; I wish I could live there!
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I always think of Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s life as having the most positive possible trajectory for an artist.&nbsp; Instead of burning out young, she grew stronger as an artist and kept doing important work in her old age.&nbsp; You are off to a young start, for a writer, publishing your first novel at age 29 (right?).&nbsp; Do you derive any lessons from O&#8217;Keeffe&#8217;s life on how to carry on making art throughout your life?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> Hmm, the book officially came out two weeks after my thirtieth birthday&#8230;am I still young?&nbsp; One thing that was inspiring to me in my research about O&#8217;Keeffe was to learn that in addition to her success she had very hard times, and times when she was frustrated and uninspired.&nbsp; Yet she always stayed true to her vision, and was at times uncompromising in following the path she saw for herself.&nbsp; So yes, I hope to work through disappointment and frustration with as much grace as O&#8217;Keeffe did, and I hope to have the same confidence in my own vision.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What was the path to publication for <I>The Dissemblers?</I></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> It was fairly typical.&nbsp; When I finished the book, I sent it to one billion agents, and got one billion rejections.&nbsp; Finally, I found a wonderful agent who wanted to work with me, and she sent it to one billion publishers and received one billion rejections, until I was fortunate enough to be matched up with the Permanent Press.&nbsp; Publishing requires a lot of persistence and a fair amount of luck.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What is your day job, and how do you balance it with writing?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> I am currently in nursing school, so one day I will be both a nurse and a writer.&nbsp; I find that time constraints actually make me more productive, and &#8220;real world&#8221; experiences provide a lot of inspiration to write.&nbsp; I tend to only write productively for one to two hours per day, so there is plenty of time left over for me to work a day job!
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What are you working on next?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>LC:</b> This is my favorite topic, so I&#8217;ll try to restrain myself&#8230;I&#8217;m working on a novel about a girl who grows up in the circus and her relationship with her father, who grew up in Hungary when it was under Soviet control and left during the 1956 revolution.&nbsp; It is told from both of their perspectives, and has been a joy (and very frustrating) to research and write.&nbsp; Needless to say, I am very excited about my next project!

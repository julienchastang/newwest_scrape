							Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain" won the awards for Best Director, Best Motion Picture-Drama, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Song last night at the Golden Globe Awards.  It was the only the second time a film set in the Western U.S. has won the Best Picture award from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the other was 1991's "Dances With Wolves").  When accepting his award for Best Screenplay, Larry McMurtry--who co-wrote the script with Diana Ossana--thanked his typewriter, a Hermes 3000, which he said "has kept me for thirty years out of the dry embrace of the computer."  <br />
<br />
This kind of recognition also helps raise the profile of the annual <a href="http://www.denverfilm.org" title="Denver International Film Festival">Denver International Film Festival</a>, which featured the U.S. premiere of "Brokeback Mountain" this year, honored Ang Lee with a career achievement award, and sponsored a discussion by the film's screenwriters (see <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/4463/" title="Proulx, McMurtry and Ossana Discuss Adapting "Brokeback Mountain"">Proulx, McMurtry and Ossana Discuss Adapting "Brokeback Mountain"</a>).  The festival picked a winner last year, too, hosting the premiere of the Phil Anschutz-funded "Ray" and scoring a Denver appearance by Jamie Foxx, the eventual winner of the Oscar for Best Actor.

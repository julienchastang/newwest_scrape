<p>
	In her debut nonfiction book, <I>Eight Women, Two Model Ts, and the American West</I>, Bozeman writer Joanne Wilke pieces together the journey her grandmother, great-aunt, and six of their female friends made in a couple of Model Ts.&nbsp; In 1924, the women headed out from Iowa on a sightseeing tour that took them to the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, the Great Salt Lake in Utah, Mount Rainier, the Pacific Ocean, and Yellowstone, to name just a few of the tourist attractions of the American West that the women reached during the nine-week trip.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
They accomplished their epic ramble at a time before reliable automotive technology, consistently paved roads, or the current network of roadside motels, and even the lack of driving experience on the part of most of the young women did not deter them.&nbsp; They blew out dozens of tires, replaced spark plugs, changed oil, became stuck in mud, slept outside in tourist camps, and made friends on the road.&nbsp; By the time Wilke sat down to interview three of the travelers, when they were in their eighties and nineties, many of the facts of the trip had slipped from their memories.&nbsp; As Wilke writes, &#8220;The 1924 road trip was just one summer&#8217;s adventure for these women.&nbsp; It was outstanding only as a beginning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
After Wilke&#8217;s grandmother Marie and great-aunt Laura died, a journal Laura kept of the trip turned up, as well as a bundle of letters that Marie had sent home, excerpts of which serve to structure the narrative.&nbsp; What Wilke can&#8217;t fill in from interviews and these written accounts, she researches or imagines.&nbsp; The trip was a remarkable adventure, and an implicit part of Wilke&#8217;s project is to determine how it shaped these women she knew only after they were already elderly, and how it influenced their lives in ways that even they perhaps couldn&#8217;t detect.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Wilke tells the tale of the 1924 journey chronologically, and intersperses it with her own history, beginning with her earliest memories of her regular trips to visit her family, driving with her mother and sister &#8220;from California to Iowa in a Volkswagen Bug.&#8221;  These sections are often beautiful, filled with the sharp, sensory details of childhood experience.&nbsp; Wilke writes, &#8220;Iowa added a texture and dimension to my life and my imagination that simply wasn&#8217;t available in a single-level single-family home in the California suburbs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Several of the more contemporary memoir sections make for striking juxtapositions with the older material, such as when Wilke tells a tale about getting a flat tire as her grandmother was driving to church.&nbsp; The teenaged Wilke was astonished by her grandmother&#8217;s calm and poise as she began to change the tire, and later she practiced changing a tire over and over so she could earn the same know-how as her grandmother.&nbsp; Wilke now knows that her grandmother changed so many tires on that 1924 road trip that ever after that it probably came as naturally as breathing. 
</p>
<p>
Flat tires were only one of the hazards the women faced on the road.&nbsp; Wilke writes, &#8220;Although the Salt Lake desert was the most feared and most dangerous stretch of the highway west, Iowa gumbo probably accounted for the most difficulty and delay.&nbsp; There were mud holes with names, notorious spots where parallel tracks led through the ditch and around thigh-deep wallows.&#8221;  Navigation was also difficult in this time before modern road atlases.&nbsp; &#8220;Each of the cars followed its &#8216;Blue Book,&#8217;&#8221; Wilke writes, &#8220;which consisted of written instructions based on landmarks (like &#8216;Turn right at the yellow house with two elm trees&#8217;) rather than a map.&nbsp; When people repainted their homes a new color, it confused drivers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Several of the women never developed into steady drivers, no matter how much experience they gained on the trip, even causing a few accidents, and the cars each turned to their most reliable drivers during bad weather and on mountain passes.&nbsp; Although the women ostensibly set out to witness the natural beauty of the American West, they don&#8217;t spend as much time rhapsodizing about the scenery in their letters and journals as they do noting the day-to-day driving mishaps, meals eaten, and people they met.&nbsp; They had a huge travel agenda, and so they didn&#8217;t stay in any one place for very long.&nbsp; As the book unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that the goal for these women--most in their twenties, none yet married or mothers, some at the beginning of teaching careers--was the journey itself, away from familiar landscapes and the comforts of home.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The letters the women sent home are a highlight of the book, brimming with the sort of pep and optimism that seems to be a hallmark of young people during this period of American history.&nbsp; They refer to themselves as &#8220;kids,&#8221; laugh off sometimes serious car trouble, and crack silly jokes.&nbsp; In an early letter sent from Nebraska, Laura writes, &#8220;It seems so funny to talk to some Califawnia folks.&nbsp; One told us today that we had a &#8216;haad jant ahead.&#8217;  Regular pioneers for you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s awfully interesting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Toward the middle of the book, Wilke begins interspersing the road trip tale with descriptions her life as a young woman in the Bozeman area, which are interesting and well-written, but don&#8217;t seem to have as much to do with the larger road trip story, except to reveal that Wilke ended up living in one of the Western towns her relatives stopped in on during that trip. 
<br />
Wilke seems to realize the disconnect in some parts of her narrative, and writes a sort of apology for it at the end of the book: &#8220;Our lives weave together like pounding river water.&nbsp; I try to write about my grandmother only, but the connections are too strong.&nbsp; My own stories slip in, along with those of her sister, her mother, and my mother.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tease one free, or write about one of us without another.&#8221;  It&#8217;s easy to forgive Wilke for a few structural lapses, because the tale she tells in <I>Eight Women</I> remains compelling throughout.

		<p>Hello, <br />
 <br />
While I was aimlessly browsing yesterday night, I came across a dating site, which had profiles <br />
from my country/state. <br />
I registered for free with them. <br />
 <br />
Btw, the site was <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fdatesandcams.com">http://datesandcams.com</a> <br />
 <br />
Within half hour or so, I was able to get in touch with 10-15 girls within my locality. <br />
I could not believe this. <br />
I got hooked with some of the pretiest girls, whom I would never dare to aproach directly. <br />
 <br />
What I want to know is, how are the promoters of this site, able to provide service for free? <br />
 <br />
I wouldnt mind paying for such a great site too. <br />
 <br />

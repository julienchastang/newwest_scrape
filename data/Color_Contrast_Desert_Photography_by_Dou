<p>
Two gorgeous new books of desert photography offer distinct visions of similar subject matter.&nbsp; Doug Rhinehart uses a large-format 4X5 view camera to create black-and-white prints the old-fashioned way, working in a darkroom whose ambiance he describes as &#8220;akin to being in a dimly lit cave.&#8221;  Rhinehart chose the title <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Adagio-Doug-Rhinehart/dp/0981781055/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275430469&amp;sr=8-3" title="Desert Adagio">Desert Adagio</a></I> because he plays classical music as he works in the darkroom, and writes that adagios &#8220;seem to match and even nurture my inner rhythm and emotions as I work with the negatives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Without the striking colors of the desert, Rhinehart&#8217;s images make the viewer focus on form and contrast, and take note of the astonishing shapes that rock, water, light, and sand produce. 
</p>
<p>
There is a reverent, hushed quality to photos such as &#8220;Desert Wall with Figure, Monument Valley, Arizona (2008),&#8221; in which the abstract form of a person&#8212;not unlike the shape of the typical depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe, cloaked, head titled gently to the side&#8212;is etched into a wall of rock.&nbsp; A later image, &#8220;Rock Art Panel, Colorado Plateau (1988),&#8221; echoes this shape in dark, sarcophagus-like figures imprinted on the wall by some long-gone indigenous artist.
</p>
<p>
A good photographer must be an excellent noticer, capturing the details that others might pass by.&nbsp; Rhinehart displays such a skill for noticing in an image of a patch of parched mud, stippled with the round impressions of raindrops, and cracked into sharp shards, which have pinned a tough little plant in &#8220;Cracked Mud and Plant, Colorado Plateau (1999).&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Many of Rhinehart&#8217;s photographs evoke the mystery of the places he captures, the unknowable centuries that shaped them.&nbsp; How temporary the telephone poles across a hilly stretch of desert seem ("Railroad Track and Poles, Colorado Plateau 1996").&nbsp; One pole even leans, suggesting that it and other human imprints will be goners long before the rock behind them budges.&nbsp; Rhinehart&#8217;s images invite this sort of imaginative speculation.&nbsp; His &#8220;Shale Formation in the Colorado Plateau&#8221; looks ancient and powerful, reminding me of a group of headless sphinxes, their paws thrust forward.
</p>
<p>
Jon Ortner is an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in many magazines, and his <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Canyon-Wilderness-Southwest-mini-Ortner/dp/1599620790/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275430522&amp;sr=1-1" title="Canyon Wilderness of the Southwest">Canyon Wilderness of the Southwest</a></I> is, in contrast to Rhinehart&#8217;s book, all color.&nbsp; With images of southern Utah&#8217;s Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Arches, and Zion National Park, among other places, this book will teach you just how many ways rock can be red.&nbsp; It is red, orange, and cream in contrasting, undulant waves in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness of Arizona.&nbsp; In the Waterfall at Temple of Sinawava in Zion National Park, the red rock is blackened with desert varnish.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the pinkish-red of Zebra Canyon in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and purplish-red in the Bentonite Hills of Capitol Reef National Park, Utah.
</p>
<p>
The photos in <I>Canyon Wilderness</I> capture a Utah sky so blue, and red-orange rock so strangely shaped that anyone who&#8217;d never been to Arches could be forgiven for thinking these images were digitally-manipulated.&nbsp; They were actually captured on old-fashioned film--all the special effects in this book were provided by the landscape.
</p>
<p>
All the greatest arch hits are depicted here&#8212;the Landscape Arch, the Delicate Arch, the Double Arch.&nbsp; The part of the book that seems like science fiction to me is how utterly devoid of people Arches National Park is in Ortner&#8217;s book. 
</p>
<p>
When I visited Arches, it was like a big, rowdy group hike, people from all over the world swarming over the rock to get to the Delicate Arch by sunset, where instead of admiring the arch, I turned around and watched the legions of people, a mass that included a bride and groom and their photographer.&nbsp; After hiking up to the arch in grubby clothes, the bride was furtively donning her wedding gown behind an umbrella held by a bridesmaid.&nbsp; I eavesdropped on the photographer&#8217;s plan: she would somehow clear the view of competing tourists and photographers, and at precisely the right moment of sunset glory, the bride and groom would dart out in front of the arch to be immortalized.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t see if the bride&#8217;s photographer succeeded in clearing the mob for the wedding photos.&nbsp; Dispirited by the scene, I went off to look at some lizards before sunset. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;d love for some <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Gursky" title="Andreas Gursky">Andreas Gursky</a>-type crowd photographer to do a book of desert photos, leaving the people in all the shots.&nbsp; The book could be called <I>Ed Abbey&#8217;s Nightmare</I>.
</p>
<p>
Both Ortner and Rhinehart express the hope that their photographs will encourage people to help preserve the desert landscape.&nbsp; Rhinehart even shares his fears that collecting his images in a book and disseminating them might somehow encourage more tourists to run roughshod over the desert.&nbsp; He decides, &#8220;People are going to go to the desert anyway, whether I have done a book on it or not.&#8221;  I&#8217;m glad he came to that conclusion, and opted to share these photos of the desert, what he calls his &#8220;soul home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<i>Editor&#8217;s Note: In an earlier version of this review I wrote that Jon Ortner sometimes works with digital images, but his publisher informed me that all the images included in </i>Canyonlands<i> were created with a &#8220;Fuji Pamoramic 6x17cm View Camera, and Fuji Velvia 50, transparency film.&#8221;  I regret the error.</i>

		<p>NFL football is up to date all-American sport. There are grown-up football fans as easily as football fans of young age. In point of fact there are many parents fancy to initiate the kid and regular infants to this unconventional sport. But babies may not be that nice yet with football since the muscles are undisturbed developing. <br />
 <br />
On the other hand, the parents can start by getting some jerseys that fits the infant. To be realistic, there are jerseys in the service of infants in some souvenir shops, sporting goods stores and some online stores. The size varies from 12 months to 7-year-old, which is extremely conceptual until the infants are potent enough to roll in football game. <br />
 <br />
These jerseys for infants are normally made of 100% nylon construction. You can pick out the yoke that smooth has the player's rating and slew on the cover-up and back. As well, the jerseys for the duration of babies are designed with the undemanding jump down someone's throat closure at the ass and on the broke red shoulder looking for tranquil access. <br />
 <br />
Considering the winding purpose as understandably as the stuff used to generate the small shape, the jerseys in behalf of infants are personal at an standard in the main price of $40 a piece. Also you can coax more seedy ones if wait for the stock to harmonize on selling or possess a promotion. <br />
 <br />
Regardless, the richest area to contain <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nflsmall.com">NFL jerseys</a> is the internet. There are numerous online stores that furnish all sorts of commodities at bankrupt bottom prices. <br />
 <br />
In a interview, NFL jerseys are really available for people of all age. The parents disposition stumble on some with a proper covenant and their infant desire be undergoing one. It will surely draw the attention of tons when the whole blood goes to the stadium and cheers the domicile team. Objective look so great.</p>

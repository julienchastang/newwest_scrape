According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wendie-malick-star-produce-hallmark-171985" title="Hollywood Reporter">Hollywood Reporter</a>, actress Wendie Malick will star as Velma Johnston in the movie &#8220;Wild Horse Annie,&#8221; in development for summer 2012 for the Hallmark Channel. Kimberly Nordyke writes:

<p>
&#8220;The movie is being adapted from a portion of Deanne Stillman&#8217;s epic book <i>Mustang: The Saga of the Wild Horse in the American West</i>. It centers on the late Velma Johnston, a leading animal rights activist who campaigned to protect America&#8217;s wild horses. Her quest culminated in the U.S. Congress&#8217; passing the Wild Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971.&#8221;

A few years ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_1/C39/L39/ " title="New West excerpted Stillman's chapter about Comanche">New West excerpted Stillman&#8217;s chapter about Comanche</a> from <I>Mustang</I>. That chapter recently inspired the alt-country duo Granville to write the song &#8220;Blood and Gold,&#8221; which appears on their new album, and can be heard on this <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5XWt2FGZE" title="YouTube video">YouTube video</a>.

&#8226; A new story by Thomas McGuane, &#8220;The Good Samaritan,&#8221; appears in the April 25 issue of The New Yorker. McGuane <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/04/thomas-mcguane-on-the-good-samaritan.html#ixzz1KZSzB58i" title="discussed the story with the magazine's fiction editor">discussed the story with the magazine&#8217;s fiction editor</a>, Deborah Treisman. One of the insights: McGuane explains why he enjoys the physical work of ranching along with writing: &#8220;I like having a physical and factual basis in a life other than the one found in books; not everything a writer needs can be found on Google or in Lonely Planet. Wallace Stevens, a proponent of full contact with reality, seems to have been unharmed by the insurance industry.&#8221;

&#8226; Boulder writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.florencewilliams.com/" title="Florence Williams">Florence Williams</a> was a finalist for the $30,000 J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award, sponsored by Harvard&#8217;s Nieman Foundation for Journalism, for her forthcoming book <I> Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History</I>, to be published by Norton. Although the winner was Alex Tizon for <I>Big Little Man: The Asian Male at the Dawn of the Asian Century</I>, being named a finalist is a big honor for Williams and her book will be one to watch.

&#8226; The winners of the Oregon Book Awards were announced Monday. Willy Vlautin won two awards for his novel <i>Lean on Pete</i>, the Ken Kesey Award for Fiction and the Readers&#8217; Choice Award. Readers voted online for the winner of this prize. Jeff Baker of The Oregonian has the rundown of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/books/index.ssf/2011/04/willy_vlautin_wins_big_at_oreg.html#cmpid=v2mode_be_smoref_face" title="the rest of the winners here">the rest of the winners here</a>.

&#8226; The April 21 issue of Westword has an in-depth cover feature on scholar and author Adam Bradley (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.westword.com/2011-04-21/news/anthology-of-rap-adam-bradley/" title=""Word"">&#8220;Word&#8221;</a>), a professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Joel Warner discusses Bradley&#8217;s difficult upbringing in Utah, and how his interest in the writing of Ralph Ellison led to his becoming involved in editing Ellison&#8217;s never-finished second novel, which was published as <i>Three Days Before the Shooting&#8230;,</i> in 2010. Bradley then published his groundbreaking book <i>The Anthology of Rap</i>, and Warner details the controversy over it--one critic in particular drew attention to what he considered to be mistakes in the transcription of several songs&#8217; lyrics. Bradley has landed on his feet, however, preparing to issue a revised paperback edition of that book and collaborating with the rapper Common on his autobiograpy.

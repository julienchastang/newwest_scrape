							<p>Talented fiction writer Ron Carlson will be a featured presenter at Saturday&#8217;s Gala Reading during Missoula&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookfest-mt.org/" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a>.&nbsp; Carlson is a busy man these days--his first novel in 26 years, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/mountain_men_ron_carlsons_five_skies/C104/L104/" title="Five Skies">Five Skies</a>, was published by Viking in May, he recently left Arizona (where he taught for many years at Arizona State) for California, where he now directs UC Irvine&#8217;s graduate creative writing program, and last week <a target="_blank" href="http://www.graywolfpress.org/" title="Graywolf Press">Graywolf Press</a> released his new writing manual, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.graywolfpress.org/component/page,shop.flypage/product_id,244/category_id,bf8108ff1901b3e2f2376627dd7f8c0d/option,com_phpshop/" title="Ron Carlson Writes a Story">Ron Carlson Writes a Story</a>.&nbsp; I interviewed Ron Carlson via email about <I>Five Skies</I>, his current projects, and the &#8220;used and abused&#8221; West.
</p>
<p>
<b>NewWest: Most of <i>Five Skies</i> takes place outdoors, with the men only venturing into town to buy supplies or do their laundry.&nbsp; Were you inspired by a particular camping trip or a familiarity with a place?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Ron Carlson</b>: I&#8217;m a lifelong camper/fisherman.&nbsp; My dad took me to Spirit Lake in the Uinta Mountains of Utah when I was seven and I&#8217;ve been every year or two.&nbsp; Last week I was at Fox Lake in those mountains.&nbsp; Camping is elemental, of course, and I wanted an elemental setting for this book, first for my own pleasure and second so it could test these men.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did setting the novel mostly outdoors affect the plot in unexpected ways?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC</b>: My joke is that place is fate, off the Henry James note that character is fate.&nbsp; I work to create a believable place so that I can stay fully in the work, believing it as I go.&nbsp; Nothing happens nowhere.&nbsp; Places are diminishing; there is almost no here now in this country; cities repeat themselves and we&#8217;ve made the outdoors into a kind of theme park.&nbsp; I set this story at the edge of the world as well as I could, and all of the inventory of that world helped me as I wandered forward: the sand, the rocks, the sky.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I happened to be at the Bread Loaf Writers&#8217; Conference when you were teaching there in 2004, and I remember that you spoke about how when writing a short story, you like to be led wherever it takes you, and to leave yourself open  for surprise.&nbsp; With a novel, you said you can&#8217;t be quite as free form with it, that there have to be a few stations that you have in mind to begin with, places you know you&#8217;re going to stop along the way.&nbsp; Did you follow this philosophy in writing <I>Five Skies</I>, and if so, what were the stations you had in mind?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC</b>: Stories are such a mysterious and intense pleasure, full of discovery.&nbsp; The talk I gave at Bread Loaf is now my first book on writing, <I>Ron Carlson Writes a Story</I> (published this month by Graywolf) and it lays out the process of finding the story.&nbsp; With the novel I knew the men would be constructing a ramp ( a monumentally stupid project) in a pristine place and that they would proceed with scrupulous skill.&nbsp; Two thirds of the way through, I made the other two decisions about the end of the book.&nbsp; The day I made those decisions I didn&#8217;t write and I didn&#8217;t write the next day.&nbsp; Then I climbed back up and wrote the ending of the story.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you know what Darwin and Arthur&#8217;s secrets were going to be before you started the book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I knew Arthur worked in the film business and that the things he had made were temporary; built and then taken down.&nbsp; Both men&#8217;s histories unfolded as I went, noting my way under the outer story of their construction work.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You include many detailed descriptions about the men&#8217;s construction project, including the specific supplies they use and how exactly they complete each part of the project.&nbsp; How did you go about making these moments dramatic?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I simply wanted them to be credible and so I wrote it board by board.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all. It was a pleasure to write.&nbsp; Good work is a rare thing.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know if it would be dramatic or not.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Arthur Key is a very interesting character-- he&#8217;s a craftsman with a disdain for the shoddy way that things are often done.&nbsp; I wondered about where his fear comes from.&nbsp; I found it unusual, because most people who have that sort of caution and worry about safety are parents and Art isn&#8217;t a parent; he&#8217;s a fairly isolated individual.&nbsp; (Though he does become a sort of surrogate parent for Ronnie.)  Can you discuss the genesis of Arthur?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> Arthur Key is about eight guys.&nbsp; I wanted him to be a consummate craftsman/engineer who could deal with any broken thing in the real world, but I also knew he would be locked up, first as a man, and then by his past.&nbsp; I think his affection for his friends emerges almost reluctantly.&nbsp; He can read a blueprint, but his heart is trickier, more coded, and he&#8217;s learned not to trust it.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: There&#8217;s a brotherhood among these men that doesn&#8217;t have any of the pettiness that many work relationships can have.&nbsp; For example, Darwin never questions how much the medical care for Ronnie will cost.&nbsp; Do you think this camaraderie might be easier to come by when people are engaged in making tangible things together than when they are working on more abstract projects?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; The men do what they have to do, up against the real facts of the place and the day.&nbsp; In each moment I stayed with them.&nbsp; I wanted their reactions and interactions to be what men might do, not what characters serving a story might do.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I was left with a number of questions after reading <i>Five Skies</i>, such as if there honor in doing work well if the result is of little practical benefit.&nbsp; What do you think?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> There is terrific value in a good day&#8217;s work, committed carefully.&nbsp; What that work serves is a question for the ages.&nbsp; I could see a collision coming between the way they were making the ramp and the ultimate vision of such a project.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: <I>Five Skies</I> was the first novel you had written in many years, and I read in &#8220;Poets &amp; Writers&#8221; that you are working on another novel.&nbsp; Are you in novel writing mode now?&nbsp; How did this shift come about?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I&#8217;ve written a number of stories in the past two years, but I am writing novels.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say why.&nbsp; Something happened to me, my desire to sustain these dreams.&nbsp; The pleasures and challenges of the longer form have my attention now.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Has the response to this book been different than it has been for your short story collections?&nbsp; Are more readers willing to pick up a novel?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I&#8217;ve never had more mail on any book.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been gratified by the response.&nbsp; My favorite note is that readers are giving it to their parents, which means they want to talk about it with someone.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom is that people prefer novels, but that doesn&#8217;t enter into my writing plans.&nbsp; You have to write what you are keen for.&nbsp; Period.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You seem to set most of your fiction in the West.&nbsp; Do you consider yourself a Western writer?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> Absolutely.&nbsp; Whatever that is.&nbsp; The West is used and abused, and it is not a single thing, especially the new urban west and the way California has affected all of the Rocky Mountain states.&nbsp;  There are still remote, real places, but I&#8217;m not romantic about any of it.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve all seen it change, but there is a larger world here, a sky, the place over the next hills which calls to me.&nbsp; I was born in Utah and have lived in Arizona most of my adult life.&nbsp; I&#8217;m now in California which, despite the papers, is still in the West.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Your book <I>Ron Carlson Writes a Story</I> just came out from Graywolf Press.&nbsp; What is this book about?&nbsp; Are there writing guides that you admire?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> As I noted above, that book is my talk to any writers who happen to be in their first ten stories, and it is a simple guided tour of all the decisions I made in writing one of my first stories.&nbsp; There are many many wondeful books on writing.&nbsp; I like Annie Dillard&#8217;s, Steven King&#8217;s, Janet Burroway&#8217;s.&nbsp; There are forty.&nbsp; My book is a very focused look at the process and the craft.
</p>
<p>
<I>Ron Carlson will read from </I>Five Skies<I> during the Gala Reading at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookfest-mt.org/" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a> on Saturday, September 15 (7:30 p.m., Wilma Theatre).&nbsp; Carlson will also participate in the panel &#8220;Short and Sweet: The Short Story&#8221; with James Lee Burke, Claire Davis, and Rick DeMarinis (Saturday, 2:30 p.m., Wilma Theatre).</I>

							<p>Allen Barra recently wrote an appreciation of Charles Portis&#8217;s <I>True Grit</I> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/11/27/true_grit/" title="for Salon.com">for Salon.com</a>.&nbsp; Overlook Press reissued the 1968 novel to commemorate its 40th anniversary.&nbsp; Barra writes, &#8220;In a saner world, it wouldn&#8217;t have to be reissued, it would have always remained in print,&#8221; and speculates that &#8221;<I>True Grit&#8217;s</I> going in and out of print over the last four decades probably has more to do with a reluctance to take the western seriously as literature.&#8221;  Fans of western literature and films also should check out Barra&#8217;s Salon.com essay from 2006, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/06/12/mcmurtry/index.html" title=""The New True West,"">&#8220;The New True West,&#8221;</a> which I missed when it first came out, probably because I was in labor the day it ran.

If you&#8217;re looking for a unique Christmas gift, the University of Nebraska Press is offering the most amusing poet-themed t-shirt I&#8217;ve ever seen <a target="_blank" href="http://nebraskapress.unl.edu/pages/Kooser_Shirts.aspx" title="in honor of Ted Kooser">in honor of Ted Kooser</a>, the lifelong Nebraskan and former U.S. poet laureate.&nbsp; The &#8220;Ted Head&#8221; t-shirt features the poet&#8217;s friendly countenance over various psychedelic motifs; it seems they&#8217;ve tinted his glasses pink.&nbsp; Judging from his writing, I&#8217;d vote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tedkooser.com/" title="Kooser">Kooser</a> the American poet least likely to have indulged in illegal mind-altering substances.&nbsp; (As my cornhusker parents are fond of telling me, &#8220;The sixties skipped Nebraska.")

<p>
A few weeks ago, University of Colorado professor of history and author extraordinaire <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org/about/patty/index.php" title="Patty Limerick">Patty Limerick</a> offered her take on the recent resurgence of Western films in an interview with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/magazine/11wwln-Q4-t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin" title="the New York Times Magazine">the New York Times Magazine</a>.
</p>
<p>
And last week the Times ran a piece <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/us/26colfax.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin" title="on Denver's dear old Colfax">on Denver&#8217;s dear old Colfax</a>, which is undergoing an attempted facelift.&nbsp; Dan Frosch writes of the street&#8217;s literary heritage: &#8220;Colfax Avenue is often described as one of America&#8217;s wickedest streets. Jack Kerouac wrote of its tawdry watering holes in <I>On The Road</I>,&#8221; and notes that the street has a reputation as &#8220;a refuge for poets, addicts, hipsters and hustlers.&#8221;  Sounds like Ted Kooser&#8217;s kind of a place.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Frosch also talks to lovably irascible Denver historian Phil Goodstein, who has his doubts that any government plan can clean up Colfax:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;With a wry smile, [Goodstein] pointed out some of the Colfax&#8217;s more memorable landmarks, including an old optometrist&#8217;s office, now abandoned, where customers could buy eyeglasses to better see the pornographic magazines that were also on sale.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed plowing through Phil Goodstein&#8217;s two-volume <a target="_blank" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&amp;ean=9780962216985" title="history of Denver">history of Denver</a> a few years back&#8212;Goodstein is sort of Denver&#8217;s answer to Howard Zinn, always looking to rouse a rabble.

		<p>Thanks for the links. Ted Head is great (the man, his work, and the shirt). One of my favorite works (lets not call it poetry and loose potential readers) is Jim Harrison and Ted Kooser's Braided Creek. I have given out so many copies over the last couple of years that I keep an extra on hand at all times. Their conversation in verse is nothing short of stunning. Two old men peering across the vastness of their lives while death's breath touches skin. Our lives lived on the ground and damn glad of it. Whenever I need some affirmation, I pick up this little book and read and wonder anew.</p>

		<p>As for your Prof. Limerick western movies link, I have nothing but respect for the good Professor. However, these kind of quick hitting snippet interviews drive me batty. The first two questions about the recent flurry of "Westerns," illicit a broad based response that includes echoes of Vietnam and anxcious males needing screen violence to ease their small willies fevered dreams. Both of her responses are interesting and demand deeper discussion. I realize this is principally a format complaint. However, would it be to much for her or the interviewer to connect her broad statements with specific details from any of the recent films. Good God, 3:10 to Yuma, The Assasination of Jesse James..., Into the Wild, No Country for Old Men are all unique films that deserve to be treated with the respect of detail and not simply dropped into some bombastic cultural stew. I would highly recommend any of the latter three films. All make significant contributions to the Western genre. But, hells bell, even the, at times, laughable 3:10 to Yuma deserves to be taken as a specific work and not set aside as a symbol of male rage disconnected from specifics. Not long ago, Jenny had a short defense for Western writers and their work. Holy moly, some of the best literature from all genres in the world is coming out of the American West. If you don't know that...wake the hell up. As for these recent films, "Jessie James," "No Country," and Into the Wild all are worthy additions to cannon of the best of Western films. Western literature and film, at its best, goes well beyond Louis L'Amour and John Wayne and stands with the best French, Russian, East Coast, Southern, etc. books and films ever created. End of rant.</p>

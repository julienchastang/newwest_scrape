							<p>This Friday, a retrospective of the photography of Hal Gould opens at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c4fap.org/" title="The Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins">The Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins</a>.&nbsp; Gould, who was born in 1920, has led an eventful life, from his childhood in New Mexico, to his service in World War II, to various jobs (boxer, railroad worker, aviator), to his education at the Art Institute of Chicago, and the opening of his photography gallery, the Camera Obscura, in Denver.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="www.cameraobscuragallery.com" title="The Camera Obscura">The Camera Obscura</a> is a wonderful gallery across the street from the Denver Art Museum, packed with interesting prints that Gould has assembled through lifelong cultivation of friendships with photographers.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Gould" title="Wikipedia article on Gould">Wikipedia article on Gould</a>, &#8220;Early in his gallery career, Gould staged a show selling prints by Ansel Adams and Edward Weston for $25 apiece. There were no takers. Today, Weston&#8217;s Green Pepper sells for $100,000 to $200,000 at auction.&#8221;  But while Gould&#8217;s most visible role has been as the friendly, bolo-tie wearing proprietor of his gallery, he&#8217;s also put together a distinguished and adventurous career as a photographer, traveling all over the world to capture amazing images. Age has never slowed him down: the year he turned 80, Gould traveled to Antarctica and came back with some wonderful photographs, and he visited Africa in 2004.
</p>
<p>
Gould carefully culled forty prints from a lifetime of work to present in the retrospective.&nbsp; His work merits a visit to Fort Collins to see in person, but for those who can&#8217;t make the trip, the gallery is offering <a target="_blank" href="http://www.c4fap.org/" title="a selection of images online">a selection of images online</a>.&nbsp; The Hal Gould Retrospective runs from February 23 through March 24 at the Center for Fine Art Photography in Fort Collins, and the opening reception is on Friday, February 23 from 6 to 9 p.m.

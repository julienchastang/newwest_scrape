							<p>Yesterday, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/sep/09/thin-man-picked-one-book-one-denver-reading-progra/" title="announced">announced</a> that this year&#8217;s pick for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/Default.aspx?alias=www.denvergov.org/onebook" title="One Book, One Denver">One Book, One Denver</a> will be Dashiell Hammett&#8217;s <i>The Thin Man</i>.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/city/article/one_book_one_everywhere_community_reading_programs_in_the_west/C94/L94/" title="The first three years">The first three years</a>, One Book, One Denver featured living authors (<i>Peace Like A River</i> by Leif Enger, <i>Caramelo</i> by Sandra Cisneros and <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i> by John Nichols) and faced criticism for not selecting a local author, so last year they chose <i>Articles of War</i> by Denver&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/city/article/an_interview_with_nick_arvin/C94/L94/" title="Nick Arvin">Nick Arvin</a>, and faced criticism for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/02/thorn-one-book-work-in-progress/" title="not being exciting enough or involving enough of the community">not being exciting enough or involving enough of the community</a>.&nbsp; So this year&#8217;s pick of a classic crime novel should test whether they can interest a broader audience in the program without having any author appearances, which would be tricky to manage, as Hammett died in 1961.&nbsp; My bet is that they&#8217;ll try to involve Denver&#8217;s film community in the events this year, since the book was made into such a great movie.&nbsp; And to those who decry them for not picking a local, well, at least Hammett spent many of his writing years in San Francisco, which <i>is</i> West of the Mississippi.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s a fresh, solid choice and I&#8217;ll be interested to see how it works out.

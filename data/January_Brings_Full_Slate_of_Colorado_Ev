							If you haven't been getting out much lately, you're not the only one—we're smack in the middle of the Colorado winter entertainment doldrums that begin in mid-December and often extend through February.  Most national touring bands steer clear of the state during these months, except for smaller acts—primarily jam bands—that hit the ski resort town tour circuit, playing in venues such as Steamboat Springs' Levelz, Vail's 8105, and Aspen's Belly Up. Local theater and dance productions are only just starting to gear up again after a month of obligatory Nutcracker and "A Christmas Carol" performances. The National Western Stock Show is usually the only game in town at this time of year, but this January also brings a full slate of literary events that should be of interest to Western readers, including Timothy Egan's tour behind his dust-bowl chronicle, <i>The Worst Hard Time</i>, <a href="http://www.pamhouston.net/" title="Pam Houston">Pam Houston</a>'s appearances for the paperback edition of her novel <i>Sight Hound</i>, and a presentation by the wolf-lovers in <a href="http://www.sinapu.org/" title="SINAPU">SINAPU</a> at the LoDo Tattered Cover.<br />
<br />
On January 9, the <a href="http://www.centerwest.org" title="Center for the American West">Center for the American West</a> will sponsor a reading and presentation by Pulitzer Prize-winner Timothy Egan at 6:30 p.m. in the Old Main Chapel on CU Campus.  His new book <i>The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl</i> explores the struggles of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraka, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico residents during the 1930s.  Egan will give a second reading at the LoDo <a href="http://www.tatteredcover.com" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a> on January 10 at 7:30 p.m.<br />
<br />
Lovably irascible Denver historian Phil Goodstein presents his latest tome of local history, <i>In The Shadow of the Clan</i>, at the Cherry Creek Tattered Cover on January 9 at 7:30 p.m. His previous books, such as <i>Denver In Our Time: A People's History of the Modern Mile High City</i> and <i>DIA and Other Scams</i> are free of the rah-rah Denver cant that some local histories are filled with, and often explore the history of Denver from the perspective the counter-culture and minority groups.<br />
<br />
On January 14, the LoDo Tattered Cover brings conservationist Michael J. Robinson to talk about his book <i>Predatory Bureaucracy: The Extermination of Wolves and the Transformation of the West</i> for its Rocky Mountain Land Series.  The event, which is co-sponsored by the carnivore restoration group <a href="http://www.sinapu.org/" title="SINAPU">SINAPU</a>, will be held at 2 p.m.<br />
<br />
The always-entertaining fiction writer and essayist <a href="http://www.pamhouston.net/" title="Pam Houston">Pam Houston</a> will read from and sign the paperback edition of her novel <i>Sight Hound</i> at the LoDo Tattered Cover on January 23 at 7:30 p.m., and at the Boulder Book Store on January 24 at 7:30 p.m.  The book, <a href="http://www.insidedenver.com/drmn/books/article/0,1299,DRMN_63_3485479,00.html" title="which I reviewed last year">which I reviewed last year</a> for the Rocky Mountain News, concerns the intense bond between a woman and her ailing Irish wolfhound.<br />

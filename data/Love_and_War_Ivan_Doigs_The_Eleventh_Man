<p>
	Montana native <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ivandoig.com/" title="Ivan Doig">Ivan Doig</a> returns to his home state for his ninth novel, using East Base in Great Falls as the launching pad to send his characters to every part of the globe, including Guam, New Guinea, Belgium, and Alaska.&nbsp; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Eleventh-Man-Ivan-Doig/dp/0151012431" title="The Eleventh Man">The Eleventh Man</a></I> is an engrossing World War II epic, centered around newspaper reporter Ben Reinking, who is removed from pilot training and given orders to write articles for a U.S. government propaganda agency called the Threshold Press War Project (or TPWP) that provides frontline stories to run in newspapers that are too small to support correspondents.&nbsp; Besides being the son of a Montana newspaper editor, Reinking has another valuable qualification for this duty: He played football for Montana&#8217;s Treasure State University in 1941, when the team went undefeated and became known as the &#8220;Supreme Team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Two years later, all of the starting eleven have enlisted, and Reinking is assigned to chase them around the globe, hopping from airplanes to boats to jeeps to capture the individual stories of his former teammates&#8212;and penning their obituaries when necessary.&nbsp; A colonel tells him, &#8220;&#8216;Statistically speaking, in this war we are looking at a nine percent mortality rate for active combatants such as your teammates.&nbsp; Rounding that off to a whole man, as we must&#8217;&#8212;Ben stared at a human being who could use the law of averages to measure dirt on a grave&#8212;&#8217;that is one in ten, isn&#8217;t it.&#8217; &#8220;  
</p>
<p>
But the job quickly turns gristlier than predicted as more of Reinking&#8217;s friends are felled.&nbsp; In the acknowledgments, Doig writes that this story was sparked in his mind when he was researching at the Montana Historical Society in Helena and discovered that &#8220;eleven starting players of Montana State College in Bozeman did perish&#8221; in World War II.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	Reinking would have preferred to continue on his path to becoming a pilot rather than serve as a journalist at the mercy of his commanding officers, who ruthlessly edit his pieces to convey a portrait of the war that is acceptable to the government but increasingly clashes with his own war-weary views.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But Reinking finds a way to distract himself from the anguish of war, beginning a passionate affair with Cass Standish, a married Women&#8217;s Airforce Service Pilot who leads a group of women flying planes north to help hand them off to Russian soldiers as a part of the Lend-Lease arrangement.&nbsp; Cass is a brash, confident woman who loves to fly and doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;ll do about her husband when the war is over.&nbsp; Whenever their schedules match up to land them both in East Base, Cass and Ben enjoy fleeting trysts.&nbsp; Reinking thinks of her as a woman who came &#8220;with all manner of peril attached.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As the body count among his teammates rises, Reinking wonders if his superiors are purposely giving his friends dicey assignments in order to generate a story of a team of dead heroes, or if he&#8217;s merely a colossal jinx.
</p>
<p>
<I>The Eleventh Man</I> combines an action-packed plot, a red-hot love triangle, and suspenseful war scenes with the fine writing for which Doig is known, vividly conveying a huge cast of characters in such detail that the reader has little trouble keeping them straight.&nbsp; The dialogue is a particular strength, crackling with sardonic wit, subtext, and plenty of 1940&#8217;s slang, although occasionally the repartee seems more like movie dialogue than believable speech, such as when Reinking&#8217;s friend introduces him to a woman named Inez Mazzetti, adding, &#8220;But that&#8217;s all the <I>z</I>&#8216;s a guy ever catches around her, right, sugarpuss?&#8221;  Still, this snappy talk steeps the reader in the period atmosphere.
<br />
<I>The Eleventh Man</I> is a vivid account of a complex tale, and in it Doig displays all the gifts of a writer seasoned to perfection.

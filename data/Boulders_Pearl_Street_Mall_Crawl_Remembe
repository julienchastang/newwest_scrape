							When I was a kid growing up in Denver, I formed my initial impressions of Boulder as a town replete with hippies and hedonist riots partially based on the tales of my seventh grade science teacher.  He was a leather-clad vegetarian with a braided rattail that hung down his back who rode his Harley from Boulder each day to teach at Cole Middle School in Five Points.  I suppose he was an idealist, as he went out of his way to teach at one of the worst performing inner-city schools in the state.  We Denver kids goaded him about his vegetarianism, once even bringing in platters of lunchmeat to share with each otherâ€”which he promptly tossed in the trash. He rang a little service bell on his desk whenever we grew rowdy,  dinging it repeatedly and telling us, â€œYouâ€™re on my time now!â€? He really, really got into Halloween, suspending our regular science lesson, encouraging us to read ghost stories out loud to each other, and reminiscing about Boulderâ€™s Pearl Street Mall Crawl with a gleam in his eye.<br />
<br />
The Mall Crawl, for those new to Boulder, was one of the townâ€™s legendary revels of years past.  It began innocently enough in the late â€˜70s as an afternoon Halloween event for costumed kids to parade around the Pearl Street Mall.  Gradually, people began to extend the hours and age limits until mobs of drunken adults started to turning out from all over the state (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.westword.com/issues/1999-12-09/feature.html" title="Westword">Westword</a> estimated the 1989 turnout at 35,000 people) and wrecking general havok.  As arrests and disorder increased, Boulder city officials decided to shut down the Mall Crawl in 1990, spending tens of thousands of dollars to block traffic, close parking lots, flood the area with police, and convince bars and restaurants to close early. City of Boulderâ€™s quashing of the Mall Crawl proved so total and effective that other towns, such as Madison, Wisconsin, have studied it to learn how to stop their own annual Halloween riots. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/4003826/detail.html" title="This report">This report</a> by Police Chief Noble Wray of the Madisonâ€™s Police Department makes for an interesting read.)<br />
<br />
I never attended a Mall Crawl, as I was only 14 when they finally shut it down.  One of my science class friends had gone with her parents though, and she told me, â€œIt was scary.  There were people swinging from trees!â€? <br />
<br />
Although the Pearl Street Mall Crawl is no more, Boulder still offers plenty of opportunities for adults to enjoy Halloween.  In the run up to the day itself, itâ€™s always fun to go choose a pumpkin from one of the many area pumpkin farms.  There are several pumpkin patches grouped in the vicinity of 75th and Valmont Road (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pumpkinpatchesandmore.org/COfestivals.php" title="listed here">listed here</a>),  offering pumpkins, tractor rides, produce for sale, corn mazes and other merriment.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, October 23, Historic Boulder is sponsoring an even called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.historicboulder.org/events.html" title="Meet The Spirits">Meet The Spirits</a> at Columbia Cemetery (9th & Pleasant Streets).  Costumed actors will portray famous Boulder residents who are buried at the cemetery, and as an added twist, a crew from <i>Americaâ€™s Most Wanted</i> will be there to film footage for a forthcoming  episode about a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulderjanedoe.com/index.cfm" title="Jane Doe">Jane Doe</a> who was found murdered in Boulder Canyon in 1954. If you dress in mourning black, you could make it on TV.<br />
<br />
Bars and theaters around town will be throwing Halloween events beginning on Friday, October 28, and though itâ€™s no Mall Crawl, Cabaret Diosaâ€™s annual show at the Boulder Theater is easily the most packed and raucous of the bunch.  Cabaret Diosa is a theatrical local Latin-inflected big band that goes all out for its Halloween shows, constructing elaborate costumes and stage sets and writing skits that they interweave with their songs.  This yearâ€™s theme is <I>Somewhere Over The Mambo</I>, so break out those Dorothy and Toto costumes.  The show always sells out, though as of this morning <a target="_blank" href="http://bouldertheater.com/event_detail.php?id=198" title="tickets are still available">tickets are still available</a> for the show on Saturday, October 29.<br />
<br />
Although everyone knows about the monster the Pearl Street Mall event for kids eventually created twenty years ago, it looks like the retailers are planning to launch it again with the â€œMunchkin Masqueradeâ€? from 3 to 5 p.m. on Halloween afternoon.  Dress â€˜em up cute, parents, but donâ€™t let them swing from the trees.<br />

		<p>i went to a mall crawl being 16 or maybe a little older, and it was very scarey.  People start a pushing line, forcing the entire mob of people to be shoved back and forth.  Because of this i was pushed down a trampled resulting in a broken rib, with no one able to hear my plea for help.  I would never return.  I am so glad they no longer have this event.</p>

		<p>I went to the mall crawl when I was a teen in '84-'86 with my friends .  I agree with Betty it was scarry but also very exciting fun to see the costumes and attend the revelry.  Now I take my own daughter to the Munchkin Masquerade which has been a blast. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy Michele</p>

							<p>It seems that just about everyone who got his or her hands on an advance copy of Colorado writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.davidwroblewski.com/" title="David Wroblewski's">David Wroblewski&#8217;s</a> debut novel, <I>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</I>, predicted its success (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="myself included">myself included</a>&#8212;let me pause here to pat myself on the back, because that&#8217;s what everyone else is doing).&nbsp; According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121383011826886483.html?mod=yahoo_hs&amp;ru=yahoo" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a> (via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/" title="Publishers Lunch">Publishers Lunch</a>), the book &#8220;has gone into its seventh printing&#8212;a total of 90,000 copies&#8212;a week after its publication.&#8221;  Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg of WSJ credits this development to Amazon.com, who &#8220;chose the book as one of the best books of June and aggressively hyped it.&#8221;

<p>
Meanwhile in the blogosphere, Megan Sullivan, a buyer for the Harvard Book Store who writes fine litblog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookdwarf.com/?p=996" title="Bookdwarf ">Bookdwarf </a>is miffed that the WSJ gave credit for <I>Sawtelle</I>&#8216;s success only to big retailers.&nbsp; She writes: &#8220;Nowhere do they mention the fact that independents have been on the <I>Sawtelle</I> bandwagon from the beginning. I read it months and months ago and forced others at my store to read it as well. I recommended it heavily in January at the ABA Winter Institute and I wasn&#8217;t the only one. We&#8217;ve been behind this book from the moment the galleys hit our desks.&#8221;

<p>
And closer to home, Patti Thorn, my editor at the Rocky Mountain News&#8217; Book section, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jun/19/thorn-local-authors-novel-earning-national-raves/" title="devoted her Saturday column">devoted her Saturday column</a> to Wroblewski&#8217;s phenomenal sales.&nbsp; Thorn, who had predicted the book&#8217;s success in May, writes, &#8220;Of all the words in the English language, here are four of my favorites: I told you so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Personally, I don&#8217;t care who saw it coming&#8212;I just think it&#8217;s great that a book by a Colorado writer is receiving such coast-to-coast attention and praise.&nbsp; <I>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</I> is definitely the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed book by a Colorado writer since Kent Haruf&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I> became a finalist for the National Book Award and hit the national bestseller list after its 1999 release.&nbsp; And Wroblewski&#8217;s book has only been out for two weeks, so who knows what else is in store for it?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best measure of how well <i>Edgar Sawtelle</i> is taking off is that I actually overheard a group of four women discussing it, praising it, and recommending it.&nbsp; Sure, I was at the Boulder Book store for the Andre Dubus III reading, so it was a bookish crowd, but I almost never overhear people talking about literary fiction.

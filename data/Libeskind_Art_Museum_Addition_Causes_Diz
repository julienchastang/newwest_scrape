							According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4763330" title="Katy Human's article">Katy Human's article</a> in yesterday's <i>Denver Post</i>, some visitors to the new Denver Art Museum are experiencing vertigo due to the slanting walls that give the building its unusual shape.  Human writes "Museum officials say the effect is tiny--there has been only one official complaint of dizziness," but she finds several people to attest to the vertigo effect, including a group of students that CU architecture professor Taitso Makela brought to the museum recently.  The best quote comes from CU "ear specialist and balance expert" Carol Foster, who said, "My patients are not going to the art museum...You could bus a bunch of them over there and they'd be flopping around on the floor."

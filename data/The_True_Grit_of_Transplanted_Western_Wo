							<p>Many of the books I&#8217;ve read lately have been about single women who decided to move to the West, and how they lived here once they arrived.&nbsp; Marcia Meredith Hensley profiled nearly two-dozen such women in the book I reviewed this week, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/no_husband_no_problem_for_women_in_staking_her_claim/C39/L39/" title="Staking Her Claim: Women Homesteading the West">Staking Her Claim: Women Homesteading the West</a></I>.&nbsp; In her memoir <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/black_sheep_finds_her_place_as_a_wyoming_shepherd/C39/L39/" title="Claiming Ground">Claiming Ground</a></I>, Laura Bell wrote of moving from Kentucky to Wyoming, where she knew next to no one and at first found work as a shepherd.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Laurie Wagner Buyer&#8217;s <I>When I Came West</I>, which I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN-bk_whenIcamewest_0328gd.ART.State.Bulldog.4c5dcdd.html" title="reviewed for the Dallas Morning News">reviewed for the Dallas Morning News</a>, is perhaps the most unusual of these tales.&nbsp; In her memoir, Buyer describes how she grew up in Chicago, was taken with a &#8220;back-to-the-land&#8221; desire at age twenty, and basically set out to find a man who lived in the wilderness that she could move in with.&nbsp; She found this man in a character who called himself Makwi Witco, and after exchanging letters with him for three months, she dropped out of college to live with him in his primitive cabin in the Montana wilderness.&nbsp; (In 2008 I reviewed Buyer&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/home_on_the_range_laurie_wagner_buyers_springs_edge/C39/L39/ " title="Spring's Edge: A Ranch Life Chronicles">Spring&#8217;s Edge: A Ranch Life Chronicles</a></I>, a memoir that deals with a later period in her life, and I was happy to learn more about the mysterious back-story of her initial move West that she only alluded to in that book.)
</p>
<p>
What struck me about all these books is how &#8220;western&#8221; these women are.&nbsp; By that I mean self-sufficient, fearless enough to embark on new adventures (even if they do experience some fears once they&#8217;re in the midst of that adventure), and knowledgeable about nature, ranch animals, and the western landscape.&nbsp; People sometimes make a big fuss over whether or not someone is native to the West&#8212;witness all those Colorado Native bumper stickers&#8212;but these books suggest that being born here isn&#8217;t the true test of who belongs here.
</p>
<p>
Take me, for example.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve lived in Colorado since I was four years old.&nbsp; Yet what do I know about helping a cow give birth or gentling a horse?&nbsp; Nothing, apart from what I&#8217;ve gleaned from the many books I&#8217;ve read that address these subjects.&nbsp; I do like rocks.&nbsp; I have a rock collection.&nbsp; So I have that going for me, cred-wise.
</p>
<p>
I left Colorado only briefly, during college.&nbsp; After four years away, I only knew that I wanted to come home for a while and live under a big blue sky again.&nbsp; I might have left again to pursue a career, only I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t.&nbsp; While Buyer, Bell, and the women in Hensley&#8217;s book staked out new territory on their own, I wimped out and hung around Colorado, near my family, breathing the familiar, humidity-free air.&nbsp; I have hardly ever lived outside of the West, but after reading about all these animal-trapping, crop-raising, sheep-herding, horse-riding, cowboy-poetry-writing women, I don&#8217;t feel very western.&nbsp; So here&#8217;s to the true grit of these transplanted western women.&nbsp; I say that if they want to go and buy a &#8220;native&#8221; bumper sticker, they&#8217;ve earned it.

&#8226; A few weeks ago I mentioned the popular consignment program at the Boulder Book Store, through which self-published and small press authors can pay a fee to have their books featured in the store.&nbsp; Megan Garber of the Neiman Journalism Lab covered the subject in greater depth in her article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2010/03/the-boulder-way-a-bookstores-experiment-with-microdistribution/" title=""The Boulder way: A bookstore's experiment with microdistribution."">&#8220;The Boulder way: A bookstore&#8217;s experiment with microdistribution.&#8221;</a>  Garber writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The store charges its consignment authors according to a tiered fee structure: $25 simply to stock a book (five copies at a time, replenished as needed by the author for no additional fee); $75 to feature a book for at least two weeks in the &#8220;Recommended&#8221; section; and $125 to, in addition to everything else, mention the book in the store&#8217;s email newsletter, feature it on the Local Favorites page of the store&#8217;s website for at least 60 days, and enable people to buy it online for the time it&#8217;s stocked in the store.
<br />
And for $255 &#8212; essentially, the platinum package &#8212; the store will throw in an in-store reading and book-signing event.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Arsen Kashkashian, the buyer for the Boulder Book Store, has also been writing about this subject and answering questions on <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/kashbk" title="his Twitter feed">his Twitter feed</a>, including some queries from those who balk at having authors pay their way onto the recommended shelf.&nbsp; Kashkashian wrote of the program, &#8220;We see it as evening the playing field a bit. They get 2 weeks to prove themselv[e]s just like big pubs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Finally, I have an author event to mention: Arundhati Roy is on a U.S. tour for her new book <i>Field Notes on Democracy: Listening to Grasshoppers</i>.&nbsp; Like a lot of people, I discovered Roy through her wonderful 1997 novel, <i>The God of Small Things</i>.&nbsp; She&#8217;s gone on to do<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy" title=" all sorts of stuff"> all sorts of stuff</a>, and she will be speaking in Santa Fe on March 24 at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lannan.org/lf/rc/event/arundhati-roy1/" title="Lensic Performing Arts Center.">Lensic Performing Arts Center.</a>

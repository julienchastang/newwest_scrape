		<h1>Pagosa Springs Peace Wreath Causes HOA Dustup</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>

							The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_christmas" title=""War on Christmas"">"War on Christmas"</a> rhetoric may have died down this year, but a community in Pagosa Springs, Colorado is finding a way to disagree about holiday decorations anyway.  According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5174544,00.html" title="Dick Foster's article">Dick Foster's article</a> in today's <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, a couple is in trouble with the Loma Linda HOA because they chose to hang a peace sign wreath.  The wreath looks pretty tasteful, made of pine boughs with a red bow, like any other holiday wreath.  But Bob Kearns, the president of the HOA, has ordered them to take down the peace sign wreath or receive a $25 a day fine if they keep it up.  <br />
<br />
Foster quotes a bunch of people on both sides of this dispute who say they are Vietnam veterans, and so should either have the right to display a peace sign, or should not have to look at one.  But Kearns takes things a step further, telling the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.durangoherald.com/asp-bin/article_generation.asp?article_type=news&article_path=/news/06/news061126_2.htm" title="<i>Durango Herald</i>"><i>Durango Herald</i></a> that the peace symbol "has a lot of negativity associated with it.  It's also an anti-Christ sign.  That's how it started."  Someone should tell Kearns that a symbol has whatever meaning the majority of people assign to it within a given community, and the vast majority of folks would recognize the circle with the centerline and two smaller bars as a peace symbol rather than as a devil worship prompter.<br />

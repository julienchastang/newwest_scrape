&#8226; I recently received a press release with some data compiled by The Nielsen Company about how many copies books endorsed by Oprah have sold, now that her long-running show is ending. According to Nielsen, 770,000 copies of the Oprah Trade Paperback edition <I>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</I> by Colorado writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="David Wroblewski ">David Wroblewski </a>(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/david_wroblewski_webcasts_with_oprah_and_rick_bass_named_finalist_for_nbcc_/C39/L39/" title="Oprah pick #62">Oprah pick #62</a>) have sold, not to mention 259,000 copies of the same book in hardcover, for a total of over one million copies of that book in American editions alone. 
</p>
<p>
As for <I>The Road</I> by New Mexico-based writer Cormac McCarthy, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/oprah_interviews_cormac_mccarthy_a_play_by_play/C39/L39/" title="a.k.a. Oprah pick #57">a.k.a. Oprah pick #57</a>, the Oprah Trade Paperback edition sold 1,385,000 copies and the hardcover sold 178,500. That means about 0.5% of all Americans own a copy of <I>The Road</I>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning apocalyptic novel. For all the doom-and-gloom news about books these days, that&#8217;s actually pretty encouraging. Here&#8217;s to the 0.5% of you who are my kind of people! (And by the way, Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s recent joint interview with filmmaker Werner Herzog on NPR&#8217;s Science Friday was very interesting--the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/arts/2011/04/mccarthy-and-herzog-talk-science/" title="podcast is available here">podcast is available here</a>.)

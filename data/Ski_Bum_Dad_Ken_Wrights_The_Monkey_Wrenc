	What happens to ski bums when they grow up?&nbsp; In his essay collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Monkey-Wrench-Dad-Dispatches-frontline/dp/0981658407/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220129911&amp;sr=8-1" title="The Monkey Wrench Dad">The Monkey Wrench Dad</a></I>, Durango&#8217;s Ken Wright provides his answer to this question.&nbsp; Wright moved from Boston to Colorado in 1983 for a season of ski bumming and never left.&nbsp; He managed to carry on with the usual adulthood rituals (he married a fellow ski bum and has two now-teenage kids) while maintaining the lifestyle that he moved West for.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Even as a middle-aged dad, Wright encourages his kids to skip school on fresh powder mornings and relishes summers spent on river trips.&nbsp; He says he lives in &#8220;(mostly) voluntary poverty,&#8221; juggling several jobs that can accommodate his adventures, including a current gig running Raven&#8217;s Eye Press, which published this book.&nbsp; Many of the essays previously appeared in such venues as <I>Durango Magazine</I>, <I>High Country News</I>, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://insideoutsidemag.com/" title="Inside Outside Southwest">Inside Outside Southwest</a></I>, and <I>New West</I>.
</p>
<p>
	He has clearly avoided living the unexamined life that Socrates cautioned against, and Wright&#8217;s insights about his choices are sharp and witty.&nbsp; Wright writes that he first came West &#8220;as a sort of back-road detour from the trip-tic route in life I&#8217;d been navigating&#8212;academic to professional to homeowner to family to beer gut to loss of body pigment to mid-life muscular attrition to pension retirement to hip-replacement surgery and then, if not sooner, unto death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	In his essay &#8220;Following in Their Parents&#8217; Fall Lines,&#8221; Wright creates a poignant portrait of one of the rituals of parenthood among those who have chosen to extend indefinitely their ski bumming days: the crack-of-dawn trip up the mountain every Sunday to drop their kids off early for &#8220;Snowburners, Purgatory&#8217;s weekly ski school for local kids.&#8221;  In a passage that succinctly summarizes the rewards and costs of the decisions he and other town parents have made, he observes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;These Sunday mornings are a tincture of mountain-town culture (or at least the skiing subculture, just one of the many intriguing tribes found in a mountain town).&nbsp; It&#8217;s a culture that, in the vein of our species tribal roots, has coalesced around a place that matters to them, and lives a lifestyle that maximizes getting out in that place as much as possible.&nbsp; The places offering this lifestyle, though, are by nature and definition not always easy places to make a living, so these Sunday morning ski-area gatherings are healthy reminders of what making as much money as possible was sacrificed for.&nbsp; They are medicine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
	&#8220;License to Shill&#8221; is a funny essay about how he and his wife, despite their repeated, careful examination of their life choices and financial considerations, were rooked into signing up for a time-share condo in Sedona, Arizona.&nbsp; His description of the mesmerizing salesman who jacked them up on coffee and would not let them leave the room until they signed a contract will put readers in mind of similar characters they&#8217;ve encountered everywhere from the jewelry store to the health club business office to the car lot.&nbsp; Wright writes of his experience that he &#8220;understood how old folks get swindled out of their retirement savings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	For all its charms, <I>The Monkey Wrench Dad</I> suffers a few problems that are common to many collections of occasional pieces.&nbsp; There is a lot of repetition, as Wright establishes certain details of biography or proclivity repeatedly in several essays (such as the fact that he and his son love to camp outside).&nbsp; The essays skip around freely, and as a result the book lacks the pleasures that a sustained narrative can offer, and there are gaps in Wright&#8217;s tale.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
For example, most of the essays are set during the period when Wright&#8217;s children are already go-getting outdoors-people, in their double-digits, always up for a ski or rafting trip.&nbsp; I would have liked to learn how Wright managed his entry into wilderness parenting&#8212;when the kids were tiny, did he have to scale back his adventures?&nbsp; And how and when did he start teaching them to ski?&nbsp; Did he consider what would he have done if his kids didn&#8217;t take to his enthusiasms?&nbsp; Even though his own kids are wilderness fiends, does he know of any other ski bum parents whose daughters turned out to be more interested in princesses than powder?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
He seems so confident in having made the right decisions: did he ever question if maintaining this lifestyle was feasible?&nbsp; Did he ever question whether he should try to take a more stable job to provide for his children&#8217;s future education as his own parents did for him?&nbsp; I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that Wright isn&#8217;t doing a great job as a &#8220;monkey wrench dad"&#8212;it definitely appears that he is&#8212;but it would have been more interesting to learn about whether he at least struggled with any of these issues that face all nature-loving parents than to read another account of a river trip or ski day. 
</p>
<p>
I suspect I can guess what Wright&#8217;s answers to some of these questions would be&#8212;probably that all kids take naturally to nature if they are introduced early, often, and consistently enough, which has been my observation.&nbsp; He writes, &#8220;What kids really need is unstructured time in big open spaces.&nbsp; That&#8217;s pretty much it.&nbsp; Then they&#8217;ll become whoever they are,&#8221; but he could have further interrogated the specific choices a parent must make to provide this.
</p>
<p>
	Because of its repetition, <I>The Monkey Wrench Dad</I> is probably best dipped into rather than read all at once, but its many fine essays offer plenty of insights for everyone who seeks to combine parenting with wilderness adventure.

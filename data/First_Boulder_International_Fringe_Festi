							The first ever <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulderfringe.org/media/press-kit.aspx" title="Boulder Fringe Festival">Boulder Fringe Festival</a> begins today, filling venues across town with theater, art, music, and a variety of other types of performance through August 28.  The tradition of fringe festivals began in Edinburgh in 1947, when a group of performers shut out of the Edinburgh International Festival decided to stage their own event.  Ever since then, fringe festivals have been held across the globe, offering a chance for experimental, avant-garde, and amateur theater groups to showcase their work for audiences.  Fringe Festivals are traditionally un-juriedâ€”that means thereâ€™s no application or weeding-out process, and everyone who can haul their act to town is guaranteed a venue to perform in.  The Boulder event has been winnowed slightly, based on the amount of venue space availableâ€” according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/theater/article/0,1713,BDC_2515_3989271,00.html" title="Daily Camera Theater Critic Marc Collins">Daily Camera Theater Critic Marc Collins</a>, out of 123 applications, 70 groups were chosen.<br />
<br />
Iâ€™m curious to see how the turn-out will beâ€”although Boulder is an artsy town, filled with people who appreciate a variety of entertainment, most of the scheduled events are an hour long and cost $10-$12 a ticket.  I know plenty of people who wonâ€™t pay a three-dollar cover charge to see a bar band theyâ€™re not familiar with, so convincing people to cough up $12 to see an unknown theater troop might be tricky.  According to Marc Collinsâ€™ interview with Executive Director Lawrence Kampf, fringe festivals tend to start out small their first year and grow ever larger as they catch on with the local public.  Another plus for the fledgling festival is that it will be so omnipresent for the next few days, only the most reclusive Boulderites wonâ€™t stumble across it.  There are events scheduled for the Boulder Public Library, The Dairy Center for The Arts, Naropa Performing Arts Center, Boulder Theater, Boulder High Schoolâ€™s auditorium, Trident bookstore, Trilogy, CU campus, and more.<br />
<br />
The variety of performances is staggering.  Iâ€™ve got my eye on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trainedfleas.com" title="Acme Miniature Flea Circus">Acme Miniature Flea Circus</a>, â€œan authentic Victorian flea circus,â€? featuring flea stars Midge and Madge that will entertain audiences at the Boulder Public Library, Thursday through Sunday, August 18-21.  In a curious bit of scheduling, an adult-oriented burlesque troop, FlashDance Studios, will present <i>Passion and Perfume</i> at Boulder High School (August 20-26), proving that Boulder parents really are more liberal about what goes on in their childrenâ€™s school than say, the Kansas Board of Education. Making its debut at the Old Main Chapel on CU campus will be <i>Magdalene: The Musical Preview of a New Rock Opera</i> that was written by local thespians, offering an alternative history of Mary Magdalene, August 19-28.  The offerings go on and onâ€”by the end of the festival, over 300 performances will be staged.  This weekend, the Daily Camera published a good crib sheet on what to expect in a variety of different genres (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulderfringe.org/media/" title="collected">collected</a> on the Fringe Festival website)â€”and with an event this big, youâ€™ll need a guide.<br />

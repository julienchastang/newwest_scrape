							<p>I have a lot of good news to report this week about regional writers:
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Last week <a target="_blank" href="http://www.penusa.org/node/102" title="Pen Center USA">Pen Center USA</a> announced that Moscow, Idaho&#8217;s Kim Barnes has won their award for Fiction for her novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/gone_fishing_kim_barnes_a_country_called_home/C39/L39/" title="A Country Called Home">A Country Called Home</a></I>. (A complete list of winners <a target="_blank" href="http://www.penusa.org/node/102" title="is here">is here</a>.)  Conveniently for those who may have missed this absorbing, lyrical novel, the paperback edition just hit bookstores last week.&nbsp; Last year I spoke to Barnes about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_kim_barnes_part_one/C39/L39/" title="her inspiration for the book">her inspiration for the book</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_kim_barnes_part_two/C39/L39/" title="her difficulty with the term "regionalist,"">her difficulty with the term &#8220;regionalist,&#8221;</a> among other topics.
</p>
<p>
Pen USA will also honor Elmore Leonard with a lifetime achievement award.&nbsp; According to the organization&#8217;s website, &#8220;In a career spanning 60 years, Leonard has published 43 novels and numerous short stories, creating a distinct literary style that has delighted readers and influenced a new generation of writers.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
&#8226; The winners of the Willa Awards for &#8220;for outstanding literature featuring women&#8217;s stories set in the West&#8221; were announced recently in Los Angeles.&nbsp; Jana Richman won in the contemporary fiction category for her novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/saddle_sore_jana_richmans_the_last_cowgirl/C132/L39/" title="The Last Cowgirl">The Last Cowgirl</a></I>.&nbsp; (A complete <a target="_blank" href="http://www.womenwritingthewest.org/willaaward.html" title="list of winners is here">list of winners is here</a>.)  I spoke with Richman last year about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_jana_richman/C39/L39/" title="the Utah environmental issues that fuel her fiction">the Utah environmental issues that fuel her fiction</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Harper Perennial will publish Denver writer and engineer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nickarvin.com/" title="Nick Arvin">Nick Arvin</a>&#8216;s new novel, <I>The Reconstructionist</I>, in the fall of 2010.&nbsp; According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com" title="Publisher's Marketplace">Publisher&#8217;s Marketplace</a>, the book follows &#8220;a forensic investigator who specializes in car crash sites, and who enters a haunted affair with the wife of his mentor in the profession,&#8221; and the sale was &#8220;a six-figure deal.&#8221; Fox has purchased the rights to make the story into a TV series.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_nick_arvin/C39/L39/" title="I spoke with Arvin in 2007">I spoke with Arvin in 2007</a> about his first novel, <i>Articles of War</i>, which was a One Book, One Denver selection.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Book festival season in the West continues to roll along, with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caspercollege.edu/events/lit/index.html " title="Casper College Lit Fest">Casper College Lit Fest</a> to be held from October 8 through 10.&nbsp; William Powers, Tim Sandlin, Greg Pape, and Linda Hasselstrom will present workshops and readings. The people at the Wyoming Arts Blog encourage people <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2009/10/attending-literary-conference-is-good.html" title="not to let swine flu fears keep them away">not to let swine flu fears keep them away</a> from the festivities.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; I was too busy covering the Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Bookseller Association trade show last week to mention this, but it&#8217;s not too late to catch the final day of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uidaho.edu/newsevents/item.aspx?id=40167" title="Hemingway Celebration at the University of Idaho">Hemingway Celebration at the University of Idaho</a> in Moscow. Tonight Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award winner Michael Dahlie will read from <I>A Gentleman&#8217;s Guide to Graceful Living</I> at the Kenworthy Performing Arts Center in Moscow (7:30 p.m.).&nbsp; 
<br />
Speaking of Kim Barnes, she had this to say about Hemingway&#8217;s Idaho legacy in a press release related to this event:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just Hemingway&#8217;s brilliant craft that we in Idaho appreciate &#8211; it&#8217;s his characters&#8217; connection to landscape and the rhythms of the natural world.&nbsp; To perpetuate Hemingway&#8217;s deep attention to the art of the story and to draw inspiration as he did from Idaho&#8217;s wild beauty is why so many of us choose to live and teach here, and why a large number of our students come here to study. It&#8217;s not just our legacy &#8211; it&#8217;s our literary lineage.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
&#8226; And speaking of Hemingway: Tucson-based writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tommillerbooks.com/" title="Tom Miller">Tom Miller</a> recently wrote a funny and fascinating recollection of a Hemingway-themed trip to Cuba for the L.A. Times, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-caw-off-the-shelf4-2009oct04,0,7529902.story" title=""Off The Shelf: The day Hemingway's Nobel Prize came out of hiding."">&#8220;Off The Shelf: The day Hemingway&#8217;s Nobel Prize came out of hiding.&#8221;</a>  Miller, who has traveled extensively in Cuba and has written and edited several books about the country, including <I>Trading With the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro&#8217;s Cuba</I>, was hired as a guide for the actress Mariel Hemingway, whose husband was making a documentary about her pilgrimage to Cuba to see the places her grandfather had spent time in.&nbsp; Miller writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My most daunting task was to convince Cuba&#8217;s Catholic Church to take Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s 1954 Nobel Medallion out of hiding so Mariel could see it. When Ernest won the 23-karat gold medal, he wanted to give it to the people of Cuba, off whose north coast his novel &#8220;The Old Man and the Sea&#8221; is set. Rather than turn the medallion over to the Batista government, he placed it in the custody of the Catholic Church for display at the sanctuary at El Cobre, a small town outside Santiago de Cuba on the island&#8217;s southeast coast.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Miller eventually does get to commune with Hemingway&#8217;s Nobel Medallion, which is lodged, unceremoniously, in a manila envelope.

&#8226; Kevin Canty will read from his sharp, funny short story collection <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/looking_for_love_in_all_the_wrong_places_kevin_cantys_where_the_money_went/C39/L39/" title="Where the Money Went">Where the Money Went</a></i> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.factandfictionbooks.com/event/kevin-canty-reading-signing" title="Fact &amp; Fiction">Fact &amp; Fiction</a> in Missoula on October 9 (7 p.m.).

<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2009/10/montana-names-henry-real-bird-as-new.html" title="The Wyoming Arts Blog">The Wyoming Arts Blog</a> also noted that Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer just appointed Henry Real Bird as the state&#8217;s third poet laureate, and offered this bio of the poet:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Real Bird lives on the O-W Ranch in Big Horn County with his wife and children. In addition to his writing and ranching, he raises champion bucking horses. He has published a dozen children&#8217;s books and a poetry book, &#8220;Where Shadows are Born&#8221;, and has recorded a CD, &#8220;Rivers of Horse.&#8221; He was featured in the award-winning documentary &#8220;Why the Cowboy Sings&#8221; and won the Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>

&#8226; Finally, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mariasbookshop.com/" title="Maria's Bookshop">Maria&#8217;s Bookshop</a> in Durango is celebrating its 25th anniversary this month.&nbsp; Shawna Bethell of the <a target="_blank" href="http://durangotelegraph.com/telegraph.php?inc=/09-10-01/second1.htm" title="Durango Telegraph">Durango Telegraph</a> described the store as &#8220;a well-reputed hub of the Four Corners region&#8221; and observed that the &#8220;southwest aura&#8221; of the bookstore is &#8220;palpable&#8221;: &#8220;Walk into the shop and it&#8217;s palpable: rich, golden woodwork, Western sunlight streaming through the large windows, and the broad selection of native and Southwest regional titles that grace the spines of the books. Maria&#8217;s is symbolic of all the Four Corners represents &#8211; and local writers support that.&#8221; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/Joebfoster" title="Twitter.com/Joebfoster">Twitter.com/Joebfoster</a>.)

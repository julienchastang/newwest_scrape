							Janet Forgrieve reported for the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> today on the scheduled June 1 closing of Jones Drug, a store that first opened in Boulder in 1902 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4653673,00.html" title=""Boulder drugstore closing"">"Boulder drugstore closing"</a>).  Jones Drug moved to its current location on University Hill, where it has long been one of the most prominent businesses, in 1960.  The demise of Jones Drug, which owner Tito Roberts attributes to fewer customers and too-high rent payments, is only the latest in a long line of University Hill casualties. <br />
<br />
In 2003, the long-running music venue and bar Tulagi closed, and its building next to the Fox Theatre still stands vacant.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradodaily.com/articles/2005/02/20/news/news02.txt" title="Various plans">Various plans</a> to turn the empty building into a bar or music venue have failed due to opposition of The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hillneighbors.com/" title="University Hill Neighbors Association">University Hill Neighbors Association</a>, whose members don't want to see more alcohol-serving establishments open nearby that could possibly fuel <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/city_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2422_3298089,00.html" title="couch-burning melees">couch-burning melees</a> like those of years past.  Wax Trax Records left The Hill several years ago, and upscale clothing store Kinsley & Co. recently moved to a Broadway location.  The Flatirons Theater, which used to be one of Boulder's primary independent movie houses, is now only open intermittently for speakers and other events.  The only businesses that seem to thrive on The Hill currently are fastfood restaurants, as the location's proximity to campus attracts hungry college students to its cafés, delis, pizza joints, and burrito vendors. <br />
<br />
According to Forgrieve's article, revitalization plans might be in the works: "Last year, the University Hill General Improvement District commissioned a study by Ross Consulting Group, aimed at assessing the neighborhood's strengths and weaknesses in light of current retail trends. The 58-page report included input from merchants, residents and CU students, all of whom said the district's charm lay in being a funky place to hang out and having a slew of mom-and-pop type businesses. 'One of the big picture findings from that report was that redevelopment on the hill would best be accomplished by assembling properties, doing a larger scale development,' said Molly Winter, Boulder's director of downtown and University Hill management."<br />
<br />
But revitalization could be a long time in coming—although numerous proposals have been floated over the past several years, none has yet been enacted, and several empty venues on The Hill continue to deteriorate—especially the former Tulagi space—as no new businesses move in to rehab them.<br />

		<p>It's shameful how the Hill has deteriorated due, in part, to the fierce opposition to new businesses from the Neighbors Association. Apart from the obvious "If you don't like to see businesses in a business district, why did you move so near a business district?" question is the question of how much influence a very local (neighborhood/unelected) group should have on citywide issues like the revitalization of the Hill. How many business owners will need to be thwarted on the Hill, or close up shop e.g. La Iguana, before the City decides something is wrong?</p>

		<p>Your headline is inflamatory and while at first glance the hill is certainly in a tumultous time if you look closer you will find it is doing surprisingly well. Sales tax numbers for the UHGID have been growing steadily despite all of the closings for the past two years. I would encourage you to attempt a slighly more positive spin on your stories. The Hill is not "turinging into a ghost town." It is certainly struggling with various parties attempting to control it but this meerly provides greater opportunity for those with vision.<br />
<br />
Stop the fear mongering headlines.</p>

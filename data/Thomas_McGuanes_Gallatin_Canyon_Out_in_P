							<i>Gallatin Canyon</i><br />
by Thomas McGuane<br />
Vintage Contemporaries<br />
240 pages, $13<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.taxianyone.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400041565" title="<i>Gallatin Canyon</i>"><i>Gallatin Canyon</i></a>, Thomas McGuane's first short story collection in twenty years, is out this week in paperback.  McGuane is at the top of his game in these tales set in present-day Montana and the Michigan of his youth, and a novella set in Florida.  The title story is at once a masterfully crafted piece of fiction and a moody evocation of many of the problems and changes that are facing the West today.  But far from a diatribe, it subtly employs the weariness of traffic congestion, out-of-control development, and pollution to underscore the difficulties in the primary characters' relationship.  <br />
<br />
In the title story, a middle-aged Montana man and his lawyer girlfriend make a perilous drive to Idaho to try to scuttle a real estate deal.  The man thinks he can get more money from selling his car dealership in Rigby, Idaho to a buyer from Atlanta, so he decides to anger the local buyer with whom he'd already made a verbal agreement.<br />
<br />
Both the man and his girlfriend Louise have years of relationship wreckage behind them, but he has become "so powerfully attached to her it made [him] uncomfortable that she wasn't interested in discussing our mutual future."  Louise is a water rights lawyer, and along the journey she remarks, "According to the law, water has no reality except its use.  In Montana, water isn't even wet.  Every time some misguided soul suggests that fish need it, it ends up in the state supreme court."  The man is newly prosperous because he had "caught the upswing in our local economy: cars, storage, tool rental, and mortgage discounting."  Traffic jams and bad drivers plague their trip as they pass through places such as West Yellowstone, which "seemed entirely given over to the well-being of the snowmobile."  <br />
<br />
Despite the dreariness of the journey, the man floats a marriage proposal along the way.  Events at their destination and on their return trip spell doom for the couple, and somehow the sad diminishment of the natural landscape in the area mirrors the burnt-out emotions and disconnection of the two main characters.<br />
<br />
Another gem is "Old Friends,"  which like "Gallatin Canyon," previously appeared in both <i>The New Yorker</i> and the <i>Best American Short Stories</i> collection.  The story features John Briggs, a character who McGuane employs in several pieces.  An old friend from Boston turns up uninvited with a drunken local woman at Briggs' Montana summer home, and the funniest tale in the book unfolds as the woman steals a rental car, Briggs' neighbors steal beer from him, and government authorities come to arrest the friend for financial malfeasance.<br />
	<br />
The landscape plays a prominent role in all of McGuane's stories, even those set outside Montana, including a humorous tale of a menacing drum major that culminates on a frozen Michigan lake ("Ice") and the story of an alcoholic who seeks redemption for past sins through a sailing trip off the coast of Florida ("The Refugee"). <br />
<br />
Full of wry humor (as when an active elderly character thinks of "that awful word <i>spry</i>"), sharp observations ("I was probably just experiencing the mild hostility that emanates from every sale of property"), and careful craftsmanship, this collection places McGuane among the best contemporary short story writers.<br />

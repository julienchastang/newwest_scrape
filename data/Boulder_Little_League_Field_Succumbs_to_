							The eternal debate rages: What does Boulder love more, kids or prairie dogs?  "Prairie dogs and children are both very important in Boulder," Jan Geden, director of Parks and Recreation told reporter Bill Scanlon of the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>.  According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4522986,00.html" title="Scanlon's report">Scanlon's report</a> in yesterday's <i>Rocky</i>, an infestation of prairie dogs at Tom Watson Park in Boulder prompted Geden's bold statement.  The prairie dogs' burrowing activity has rendered a North Boulder Little League field at Tom Watson Park unsafe for play, and it will not be used for games this season.<br />
<br />
But don't blame prairie dogs for putting an end to the youngsters' fun: Blame lazy parents.  According to the article, the Parks and Recreation office offered a "compromise"—"The 6-to-8-year olds could play on the field if the parents could fill in the burrows right before each game."  Despite the generous offer to supply parents with some early-morning, unpaid manual labor every weekend, the North Boulder Little League board will probably decline, according to board member Steve Brown, who told Scanlon, "The safety officer isn't going to like that, not with the little kids and the possibility that the prairie dogs carry plague."<br />
<br />
Plague-ridden and baseball-field destroying or not, you've got to love prairie dogs.  No, really—if you live in Boulder, you'd better love prairie dogs if you don't want to feel the wrath of the town's vocal and active prairie dog-loving contingent.  Why do you think Jan Geden was too afraid to say that children are a more valuable resource than prairie dogs, a statement that would appear to be non-controversial to most?  Because if she did, the prairie dog lovers would hound Geden until she lost her sanity or her job.  I learned this the hard way a few months ago when I took exception to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/4186/" title="a certain writer's">a certain writer's</a> public equation of prairie dog extermination in the West with the Rwandan genocide. The prairie dog lovers launched a prompt attack. Silly me!  I've lived in Boulder long enough to know by now that the life of a prairie dog is considered equal to that of a human being, and that their habitat is certainly more important than a baseball field for creatures so minor as children.<br />
<br />
Another telling detail in Scanlon's article is that no one in the Parks & Recreation office is considering relocating the prairie dogs at this point (a process that is complicated and very expensive).  Instead, according to Steve Brown, "the city Parks and Recreation has been very cooperative helping us find other places to play."  Places that happen to be much farther away from the homes of North Boulder Little League participants, like the field at Eisenhower Elementary School, which is usually used by South Boulder Little League.<br />
<br />
I've got an idea: Why doesn't everybody in Boulder move and leave the town to the prairie dogs?  And be sure to take your rotten kids with you.<br />

		<p>It is interesting that, in most places and in past years, the prairie dogs would simply have been exterminated or trapped and removed.<br />
<br />
I imagine the city spend a couple hundred thousand dollars on this facility (perhaps millions, if it's nice enough).  So because a couple of rodents moved in, that money is now going to waste?  Gimme a break.  Spend $800 and get rid of the problem.  There must be hundreds of thousands of prairie dogs in the Boulder area, let alone the whole of the United States and Canada.<br />
<br />
This is a simple, rational problem that should be dealt with in a simple, rational way.  Ecological zealots are protecting a species that needs no protection; the zealots in question will probably never see these animals unless someone attempts to remove them.  Then the zealots will show up with signs and in numbers to make a splash on the local media.<br />
<br />
So congratulations, zealots.  In protecting a nuisance, you have wasted many thousands of dollars and given prairie dogs more rights and priveleges than human beings.  Please, don't ever move to Missouri.  I don't want it to be a crime to hunt the little buggers in my home state.</p>

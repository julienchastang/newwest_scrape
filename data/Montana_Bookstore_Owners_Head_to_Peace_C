							<p>Jean Matthews and Russ Lawrence bought <a target="_blank" href="http://chapter1.booksense.com" title="Chapter One Bookstore">Chapter One Bookstore</a> in Hamilton 23 years ago, and a few weeks ago they sold the store to longtime business partner Shawn Wathen so they could pursue their lifelong dream of serving in the Peace Corps, according to <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.ravallirepublic.com/articles/2009/06/08/business/22business.txt" title="Bess Brownlee of the Ravalli Republic">Bess Brownlee of the Ravalli Republic</a>.&nbsp; She writes, &#8220;Their work in Peru will focus on small business development and promotion.&#8221;  Lawrence, author of <I>Montana&#8217;s Bitterroot Valley</I>, told Brownlee that they might write a book about their experiences in Peru.&nbsp; The couple, married for 31 years, will serve in Peru until August of 2011.
</p>
<p>
Matthews and Lawrence are already keeping track of their experiences <a target="_blank" href="http://jeanrusspcperu.blogspot.com/" title="on a blog">on a blog</a> (via <a target="_blank" href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/nview.jsp?appid=411&amp;j=708879" title="Shelf Awareness">Shelf Awareness</a>), and have some nice photos of their recent encounters with Peruvians and llamas.&nbsp; If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what the Peace Corps is like, this blog will give you a good idea.&nbsp; The first entries feature the couple&#8217;s adventures in packing for the two-year stint (<a target="_blank" href="http://jeanrusspcperu.blogspot.com/2009/05/edges-fray-duffel-cannot-hold.html" title=""The Edges Fray, the Duffel Cannot Hold"">&#8220;The Edges Fray, the Duffel Cannot Hold&#8221;</a>), their attempts to improve their Spanish, and the orientation classes they began to take once they arrived in Peru.&nbsp; They write:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The most popular class yesterday was presented by our Medical Officer, Dr. Jorge, on diarrhea. The official estimate of the percentage of Peru&#8217;s [Peace Corps Volunteers] who have, umm, &#8216;soiled their pants&#8217; is 95%, but he bets it&#8217;s closer to 100%.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As of this weekend, they&#8217;ve already hit a rough patch: Russ ended up in a hospital in Panama with &#8220;a torn retina of idiopathic origin,&#8221; but they expect him to make a full recovery.
</p>
<p>
Back in Hamilton, Chapter One will host a <a target="_blank" href="http://chapter1.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp;jsessionid=bacZvI2jatEOGdzJfMjis?s=storeevents" title="reading by Rick Bass">reading by Rick Bass</a> on Monday, July 13 at 7:30 p.m.&nbsp; Watch for my review of his new book, <I>The Wild Marsh: Four Seasons at Home in Montana</I> in a few weeks.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in Colorado, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.landlibrary.org/" title="Rocky Mountain Land Library">Rocky Mountain Land Library</a> recently established a Kids Nature Library at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thorne-eco.org/contactus.htm" title="Kassler Center">Kassler Center</a> in Littleton.&nbsp; (The photo is of a few youngsters enjoying the library during the first hour after it opened.)  According to Jeff Lee of the Land Library, the <a target="_blank" href="tatteredcover.com" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a> donated the necessary shelves, and they moved 1,500 books to the Center a few weeks ago. 
</p>
<p>
The Rocky Mountain Land Library has several upcoming events scheduled at the LoDo Tattered Cover, including an appearance by photographer and naturalist Paul Bannick on June 24 (7:30 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
Photographer Thomas Bachand has a new book out, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thomasbachand.com/tahoe/" title="Lake Tahoe: A Fragile Beauty">Lake Tahoe: A Fragile Beauty</a></i> (Chronicle Books).&nbsp; He writes that the book &#8220;examines Tahoe as a microcosm of the environmental challenges confronting our time.&#8221;  Through September 8, photographic prints from the book are on display at the Vista Gallery on Tahoe&#8217;s north shore.&nbsp; There will be a reception on July 11 (1-4 p.m.).

							There are still two weeks before spring begins, technically, but with highs of 70 degrees yesterday and today, I felt the restlessness to get outside and start planting flowers that I always associate with the advent of spring.  But I've lived in Colorado all of my life and I should know better by now: Colorado doesn't really have springs.  Instead it has this teasing interlude between February and June, a bipolar alternation between winter and summer temperatures, and we get a lot of our snow in March and April.  We shouldn't call it spring.  We should call it something else—maybe sprinter, as in "My this is a confusing sprinter we've been having."  Sure enough, snow is predicted for tonight and tomorrow.  <br />
<br />
Still, I see the sun setting later, the temperatures climbing higher, and yesterday on the Hill near CU campus, a girl in a mini skirt—and I think spring.  I'm not the only sucker, though: Every year my irises fall for the old bait and switch, sending out buds during a warm stretch that suffer frostbite as soon as the snow dumps, as it inevitably does.  On Boulder's Pearl Street Mall, the town celebrates a "Tulip Festival" in early April, and often as not on the big day they end up with hundreds of tulips decapitated by a storm, their petals scattered on the bricks.<br />
<br />
I know I shouldn't trust the weather on a day-to-day basis, and yet, yesterday after working all day in my dim, cave-like office that has no windows, when I came home I felt like puttering around in the small plot of dirt outside my condo where I plant my flowers.  The crocuses are up in merry shades of yellow and violet—the poor saps.  They don't know that tonight is probably their last, given the impending storm.  <br />
<br />
I still felt like planting something, and I thought <i>pansies</i>, the one flower that is relatively safe to plant in Colorado, as it can endure cold temperatures, and seems to bounce back okay after being flattened by snowfall.  Pansies aren't my favorite flower—a friend once told me that she didn't like pansies because they all wear little black Hitler moustaches, an image I have never been able to shake.  My husband doesn't like the name "pansy"—so we use the flower's French name, <i>pensée</i>, a much nicer word that means "thought."<br />
<br />
But who am I kidding?  It's the first week in March, too early for flowers.  I contented myself with merely clearing up the debris in the flower patch, gathering up leaves and twigs and junk blown in by the wind.  I should hold off on the pansies for a few more weeks, and just sit tight and sip some hot cider or lemonade, depending on what temperature it happens to be that day.<br />

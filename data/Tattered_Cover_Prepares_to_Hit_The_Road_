							This weekend's <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> included an extensive feature on the impending move of the beloved Denver independent bookstore, the Tattered Cover, from its original location in Cherry Creek to its new home in the former Lowenstein Theater on Colfax.  There's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4747366,00.html" title="a profile of Tattered Cover owner Joyce Meskis">a profile of Tattered Cover owner Joyce Meskis</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/real_estate/article/0,1299,DRMN_414_4747368,00.html" title="piece on the Colfax redevelopment">piece on the Colfax redevelopment</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4747259,00.html" title="Q&A with Meskis">Q&A with Meskis</a>, and a sidebar with customers sharing their memories of the Tattered Cover.  Of the five patrons interviewed, not one has definite plans to visit the store's new location--two say the LoDo location is more convenient, and one is a teenager who can't drive.  But even though the bookstore shoppers the Rocky talked to seemed lukewarm on the Tattered Cover's move, perhaps more telling is the fact that people have been actually calling up the store to volunteer to help move books.  It's a rare business that is so beloved as to spur this kind of enthusiasm. <br />
<br />
The one-day move will occur on June 26.  Although I'm hopeful for the new Lowenstein renovation, which will include a branch of Denver independent record store Twist & Shout and the Denver Folklore Center, I will definitely miss the Cherry Creek store.  When I was growing up, my brothers and I got most of our books from the library, but once a summer we'd make a big trip to the Tattered Cover and we'd each be allowed to pick out some books.  It seemed like a magical place to me then, and its magic hardly diminished as I became an adult.  The Cherry Creek location was very convenient, because on the couple of occasions a year when I was forced to go to the mall, I could decompress afterward with a trip the the Tattered Cover.  I saw many great readings there over the years, including an epic Sherman Alexie performance a couple of years ago in which the author provided two full hours of hilarious jokes and heartbreaking observations that was so entertaining it was hard to believe that it was free.  The LoDo store is inviting, too, but parking is always a challenge downtown, and the LoDo store doesn't carry the same weight of memory and history that the Cherry Creek location does for me.<br />
<br />
I'm certain that the new Tattered Cover will be just as friendly as the old ones, if Meskis' expansions to LoDo and Highlands Ranch are any indication, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all the shoppers who regularly dropped by the Cherry Creek location will feel like making the trek to the burgeoning hipster enclave on the strip of Colfax where the Lowenstein is located.  Something tells me that some of the store's older patrons or those who live in south or east Denver might not feel up for it, especially when they will pass a handful of Borders and Barnes & Nobles on their drive out to Colfax.<br />
<br />
As for me, since I live in Boulder now, I can't visit any of the Tattered Cover's locations as often as I'd like, but I might have to reinstitute the annual summer pilgrimmage.

		<p>It will be interesting to see if customers follow and if Joyce is able to help lead the transformation of Colfax the way she did in Cherry Creek and Lodo. <br />
<br />
One point of minor correction: the current Cherry Creek site is not the "original" location as you indicate; it's actually the TC's third store in the neighborhood. And customers also volunteered to help cart the books each time the store has moved before!</p>

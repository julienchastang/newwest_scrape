</p>
<p>
<b>New West: How long have you lived in Boulder, and what brought you here?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Heather Hansen</b>: Just before moving to Boulder six years ago, I was living in New York and doing some reporting for a book on the aftermath of the World Trade Center destruction. I spent all day talking to women who had lost their husbands, and children whose parents had been killed. Every day I was devastated for them, but I learned a lesson that&#8217;s stayed with me: if there&#8217;s something you want to do in life, get to it. I&#8217;d lived on both coasts, and abroad, but I really wanted to spend some time near the mountains. And now I&#8217;m home.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you first become involved in travel and environmental writing?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Travel and the environment are long-time passions and this book allowed me to explore the overlap between the two in a way that enhanced my globetrotting. It&#8217;s one thing to go diving in the Gal&#225;pagos; it&#8217;s another thing entirely to see the islands through the eyes of a naturalist who grew up there and is devoted to protecting them.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you come up with the idea for <I>Disappearing Destinations</I>?</b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307277367"><img src="http://www.newwest.net/images/thumbnails_feature/disappearing_destinations300.jpg" width="193" height="299" /></a>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Kim and I were at a conference in Denver, talking about the book <I>1,000 Places to See Before You Die</I>, which had just come out. We tossed around the idea of &#8220;1,000 Places to See Before THEY Die.&#8221; Once we started looking at our favorite places in that context, we became obsessed with writing a book that could help travelers see their dream destinations as whole places with real issues that affect the lives of the people who live there and, ultimately, the viability of the locations themselves. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you and Kimberly Lisagor meet?&nbsp; Have you collaborated before?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: We met at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley in 1997. We&#8217;d long admired each other&#8217;s work and had been waiting for the right opportunity to collaborate; <i>Disappearing Destinations</i> gave us that. While we were at Berkeley we trained for and ran the LA Marathon and edited a magazine together so we knew, early on, that we could go the distance on a chosen project.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you decide which places to write about?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Picking which places to cover was somewhat grueling. Our first list had 200 places on it but, in the interest of covering each destination comprehensively, we had to cut it way down. We worked hard to get both a geographical cross-section as well as a decent representation of environmental issues. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you or Kimberly Lisagor travel to each of the locations you describe?&nbsp; How did you divide up the places you wanted to cover?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Splitting them up was actually easier than you might think. We already had first-hand experiences with most of 37  places prior to writing the book and the ones that we traveled to specifically for the book were places on our personal &#8216;must see&#8217; lists. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: As sad as the environmental degradation you write about is, it sounds like a great gig to travel to as many places as you did to write this book.&nbsp; Did your publisher cover your travel expenses?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: All travel was on our dime, including paying for carbon credits to offset our emissions (it was really important for us to &#8216;neutralize&#8217; our own journeys). Going to some of the places that are being greatly impacted by tourism was particularly tricky but, in each of them, we saw how effective responsible travel can be as a conservation strategy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How long did it take to travel to all these places, and how long did it take to write the book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: The whole process--from concept to publication--took about two-and-a-half years. We traveled sporadically throughout that time. My longest stretch away from home was a month I spent in Peru and Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What was your basic game plan at each of these destinations--how did you set up interviews and conduct research?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Most of the research and interview scheduling was done before we got to a place, though we took every opportunity to interview on the fly. There were times when I stumbled upon some great characters. Jett Hitt, the composer-poet-cowboy in the Yellowstone chapter, was one such find. I met him by chance but realized right away that he should tell readers about Yellowstone&#8217;s history, sights and sounds.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Global warming seems to be the cause of many of the problems you describe, particularly in two places in this region, the Cascades and Glacier National Park.&nbsp; Do you think it&#8217;s more difficult for local people to respond to the situation when the cause is so widespread?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: In the case of climate change in this region, there&#8217;s plenty that people can do on a daily basis to mitigate its effects. (Aspen&#8217;s innovative &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.canaryinitiative.com/" title="Canary Initiative">Canary Initiative</a>,&#8221; is a great example.) It may be difficult to see immediate results but that doesn&#8217;t mean we aren&#8217;t making a marked difference at a critical time. As Gerald Meehl, a climate modeler at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder says in the book: &#8220;The longer we wait, the worse the problem gets. Every day we&#8217;re committing ourselves to climate change in the future. When you view it that way, it&#8217;s not something that you should just give up on. It&#8217;s something that should motivate you to do something about it sooner rather than later.&#8221; In the case of indigenous people, like the Inuit in the Arctic or Pacific islanders&#8212;who did little to land themselves in the throes of global warming&#8212;the answer is sadly more straightforward. At this point, rapid adaptation to a new reality is their only option.
</p>
<p>
Since our expertise is in how to travel more mindfully our message is also that all us have control over the way we move around the world. We have the power to affect change--for worse, or we hope better--in these places with the choices we make. For example, if you go to the Gal&#225;pagos, you have the choice whether or not to support an outfitter with a proven record of environmental stewardship and investment in the local community. Or, more generally, if you usually take two one-week trips a year, consider taking one two-week trip instead. This cuts down on carbon emissions and increases the likelihood that you&#8217;ll connect with the place you&#8217;re going. We talk a lot about traveling &#8220;right,&#8221; which can be tough if you&#8217;re not sure how to get started. We give some resources for that in the book. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You list many environmental problems in your chapter on Yellowstone National Park, including bison herds who wander out of the park and are slaughtered and noise and air pollution from snowmobiling.&nbsp; What do you think is the biggest challenge facing Yellowstone National Park?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Like all national parks, Yellowstone&#8217;s greatest challenge is a lack of funding. A $23 million budget shortfall every year greatly affects wildlife management and other park policies. The bison situation, for example, has gotten worse since the book went to press. According to National Park Service statistics, the herd now numbers around 2,200 animals, fewer than half of what it was last fall. Over 1,600 bison were killed by hunters or shipped to slaughterhouses in an effort to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Another 700 animals succumbed to the harsh winter. The aesthetic and ecological effects of the bison&#8217;s disappearance in the park cannot be underestimated. 
</p>
<p>
In terms of the management of humans in the park, the possibility of more cell phone towers is a serious problem, not only from a visual standpoint but because of the sense of wildness that&#8217;s ultimately lost when, no matter where you are in the park, you can hear someone buying or selling stock (which I overheard while I was overlooking the breathtaking Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone). The use of snowmobiles is another issue that persists, despite having obvious environmental impacts and not having widespread support among ordinary Americans.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What do you suggest that people who are concerned about the issues you raise in your book do?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: What needs to be done really varies from one location to the next. In some places, responsible tourism is the &#8220;great green hope&#8221; as I talk about in the Appalachia chapter. Just going there and contributing to the diversification of the economy makes a difference (this is also the case in the Congo Basin and the Amazon where tourism revenue can sustain a population in the long tern, while logging cannot). Every place in the book has advocates working to protect it, many of which we listed in an appendix.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You don&#8217;t mention any in the book, but is there a place in Colorado that you would consider endangered?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Absolutely. Both the Roan Plateau and the statewide spruce bark beetle epidemic are issues that have been on my radar for a few years now. I hoped to write about bark beetles in <i>Disappearing Destinations</i> but, at the time we were finalizing our list, the jury was still out on how widespread the destruction was going to be. It&#8217;s been good to see that the issue is getting more coverage in the mainstream press now and, if it&#8217;s too late to prevent the death of trees, it&#8217;s not too late to think about the aftermath, which includes increased fire danger. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What is your next project?&nbsp; Do you plan to write another book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: Over the summer I&#8217;ll be writing some chapters for a mainstream green travel guide that will be out next year. Beyond that, I&#8217;d really like to focus on the West for a while. And my first love is nature writing, so I&#8217;d really like to do more of that. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Is Boulder a good base for freelance writing?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>HH</b>: It&#8217;s terrible! There&#8217;s far too much temptation here to go outside and play. At the same time, I&#8217;m constantly inspired by my neighbors who use their lives and work to do so much good. Some of the scientists who contributed to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore last year, are based in Boulder. As are some photographers and filmmakers who have risked their lives to document these changes.

		<p>You say  "The use of snowmobiles is another issue that persists, despite having obvious environmental impacts and not having widespread support among ordinary Americans."<br />
<br />
I say that you don't have any clue what our sport is about, you have never tried it, or even met a snowmobiler.<br />
<br />
You flit from one country to another, skimming a list of issues to list in your book, and you proffit from that excersise. That's nice.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you don't know what you are talking about, and when it comes to snowmobiling, I suggest you actually do some homework before issuing such a blanket statement.  Having said that, I'm sure that your target audience is saying Bravo.<br />
<br />
In Canada and the USA, motorized sport is growing in popularity, and actually introduces thousands every year to the great outdoors. Like hunters and fishermen, snowmobilers are amoung the strongest proponents of a healthy environment, and are very knowledgable concerning the issues.<br />
<br />
I suspect you have made other blanket statements in your travels, and though they are popular with the "stop the seal hunting" crowd, they are probably just as flawed as your statement on snowmobiling.<br />
<br />
Snowmobilers are usually members of clubs, and as such are collectively very concerned about environmental impacts, and go to great lengths to protect nature in their activities.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that if we added up YOUR environmental footprint, like the tons of fuel it takes to fly you all over the world, and added up how many trees you have murdered by creating and selling books, that you probably do more damage than three snowmobile enthusiasts put together.<br />
<br />
You have little understanding of snowmobiling.  I suggest you do more research before endorsing or agreeing with unsupported allegations of various environmental groups, on the topic od snowmobiling.<br />
<br />
Sell your books, yes, but don't do it at the expense of my sport.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

		<b>Comment By Steven Earl Salmony, 5-24-08</b>
		<p>A new kind of leader, the likes of Heather Hansen, presents the rest of us with something of surpassing value: intellectual honesty. She thinks and speaks out courageously in an intellectually honest way. She does not cover-up or hide from what could somehow be real and true. <br />
<br />
Perhaps human beings could more effectively address the emergent and convergent global challenges we see looming ominously before the family of humanity on the far horizon if so many of our leaders did not abuse human intelligence and ingenuity by choosing to adamantly idolatrize the endless growth of the global political economy.<br />
<br />
Science, reasoning and common sense are being twisted and subrugated to conform to whatever thinking serves the intentions of big-business powerbrokers, their bought-and-paid-for politicians. and other 'leaders'  who promote the politically convenient and the economically expedient, in the course of  worshipping soon to become unsustainable economic growth.<br />
<br />
Heather Hansen, Kim Lisagor and many other young people, show us how ignorant too many of our leaders are of the human condition and the finite world we inhabit, and how selfish and harmful are their intentions when they relentlessly seek to accumulate material wealth and political power, come what may for the children, coming generations, life as we know it, and the integrity of Earth and its environs.<br />

		<p>Holy crap!  What an enviro whacko!<br />
<br />
Honestly, you offset your carbon footprint by buying carbon credits?!  Really?  What a sham that is.  The only true way to reduce your carbon footprint is to reduce it.  Sorry, you can't really buy your way out, and although you may feel good throwing money at the problem, it isn't a solution.  You and Al Gore... geez.<br />
<br />
As a big 4x4 driving, ATV riding and dedicated snowmobiler, I'll put my carbon footprint up against the likes of yours any day missy.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Steven Earl Salmony, AWAREness Campaign on The Hum, 9-06-08</b>
		<p>Political Will, Political Won’t<br />
<br />
The accepted wisdom of today’s environmental reform movement is founded on two core assumptions. The first is that most of the technical solutions we need to address the world’s various crises are available, or at least could be swiftly developed by sufficiently intelligent, hard-working people. The second assumption is that all that’s lacking for a successful outcome is the political will to put these technical solutions into effect.<br />
<br />
Whether the discussion turns to replacing coal-fired power plants with wind turbines and using electric cars instead of gas-driven SUVs, converting industrial agricultural practices to organic permaculture, or reversing the decline of ocean life though international regulations, it is an article of faith in the reform movement that we know what we need to do and all that’s lacking is a sufficiently visionary leader to put more planet-friendly solutions in place.<br />
<br />
Both those assumptions ignore significant aspects of the situation – aspects that must be addressed for the envisioned reforms to be successful. This article examines those two assumptions with an eye to uncovering the confounding issues.<br />
<br />
The array of problems<br />
As the following laundry list of negative trends clearly illustrates, the scale and diversity of the problems we face are significant. <br />
<br />
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is approaching 400 parts per million.<br />
We are emitting carbon dioxide 10 times faster than one of the world’s largest known volcanic eruptions (the Deccan Traps) that was implicated in the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event 65 million years ago.<br />
Ice caps and glaciers are disintegrating.<br />
World oil production is on a 4 year plateau despite prices that have quadrupled during that time.<br />
In our oceans the coral reefs are dying, dead zones are expanding, and predatory fish species (the ones we eat) have declined by 90% in the last 50 years.<br />
The biomass of prey fish in the Great Lakes has fallen by 92% since 2000.<br />
The estimated extinction rate for plants and animals is at least 75 species per day.<br />
The Great Pacific Garbage Dump is full of plastic.<br />
Over 75,000 square miles of arable land is lost each year to urbanization and desertification.<br />
A billion people in over 110 countries are seriously affected by desertification.<br />
Nearly a third of the world’s cropland has been abandoned since WW II because of damage by intensive agriculture and erosion.<br />
On the American Great Plains, half the topsoil has been lost in the last hundred years.<br />
The Ogallala aquifer in the western United States is being drained up to 100 times faster than it is being refilled.<br />
Indian farmers have drilled over 21 million water wells using oil-well technology. They take 200 billion cubic tonnes of water out of the earth each year for irrigation.<br />
We have eaten more grain than we have grown in 7 of the last 8 years.<br />
World carry-over grain stocks were 130 days of consumption in 1986 – today, it’s only 53 days.<br />
The global per capita grain supply has fallen from 340 kg in 1984 to 300 kg today.<br />
The world price of fertilizer is rising exponentially.<br />
The IPCC predicts that climate change will cut African food production in half by 2020.<br />
The cost of food is skyrocketing world-wide. Some countries have responded by banning exports of wheat or rice.<br />
We are in the beginning stages of a global financial crisis that could result in either a deflationary or hyper-inflationary depression lasting for a decade or more.<br />
These sorts of problems are known as wicked problems. That means they are messy, circular, aggressive and interlinked, so that trying to solve one may worsen others. Each problem shows a trend, and all the trends appear to be worsening inexorably. In some cases the trends have been visible for centuries (for example the loss of arable land and desertification), sometimes for decades (as with the loss of aquatic biomass), and some like Peak Oil for a scant few years. In all cases the global trends show no signs of reversing, however much effort has been expended to alter their local or regional trajectories . As their effects become more pronounced, it becomes easier to see their potential to hit our globalized industrial civilization like a planet-sized version of Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />
As daunting as the individual problems are, the key to understanding the importance of this list is recognizing the degree of the linkages between them. In many cases, trying to solve one problem can inadvertently make others worse. One prominent example is the attempt to address global warming through the use of ethanol as a vehicle fuel. While there may have been some merit to that primary intention, the secondary effects – increasing dead zones in the oceans due to fertilizer runoff, and rising food prices due to the use of food crops as fuel – eliminated the overall benefit of the effort, and even created a net negative outcome.<br />
<br />
Similar knock-on effects have occurred in in other areas. The attempt to raise food production through irrigation and the use of petroleum-based fertilizers has depleted water tables and reinforced a style of agriculture based on a finite resource. The attempt to increase global living standards (and thereby reduce population growth) by exporting production facilities to regions with lower wage and environmental standards has backfired by increasing levels of water, air and soil pollution – increases that have been felt well beyond the boundaries of those regions. One dark quip that addresses this sort of backfire is, “Around every silver lining there is a cloud.”<br />
<br />
When viewed from this perspective it becomes obvious that dealing with the panoply of problems besetting our world involves considerably more than just knocking them down one at a time. If we don’t apply holistic, system-level thinking to the converging crisis, our well-meaning efforts stand an excellent chance of making the overall situation worse.<br />
<br />
I have concluded that it is a mistake to think of “solving” these problems in any global or final sense. Some of them may be improved regionally, especially if they are not in local conflict with other competing problems. The logical corollary is that there will be other regions where those same problems cannot be solved, due different local circumstances.<br />
<br />
The big question, however, concerns those problems that are not contained, that do not respect national or regional boundaries. Global warming and the death of ocean biomes affect us all, and failures to address these problems in any region can make the situation worse for everyone. In these cases, it’s obvious that a collective global response is called for – a response that brings together the political, economic, industrial and opinion-making institutions of our world. If these institutions acted together they might have a chance of implementing the deep and wide-ranging changes the situation calls for.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, until now we have seen precious little evidence of such a collective response. For example, we have repeatedly seen climate change conferences break down or issue watered-down statements that fail to address the scale of the accelerating crisis. While individuals, citizens’ groups and even some governments are obviously aware of the urgency, collective action repeatedly fails to gain the required global traction.<br />
<br />
This state of affairs is no accident. This is not because of some dark and sinister cabal or conspiracy to hold back change in the name of personal profit, though there probably are some instances of that. The real reasons are at once more banal and more worrisome than the Bilderberg watchers assume. In the next section I will examine the structural reasons for this sorry situation.<br />
<br />
Politics, the high art of civilization<br />
<br />
In order to understand the role that politics plays in our collective failure to address the predicament described above, we need to examine the nature of modern civilization. <br />
<br />
Now, when I use the term “modern civilization” I’m not just talking about the growth of industrialism over the last two hundred years. I’m not even talking about the growth of Western culture over the last two thousand years. What we usually think of as “modern civilization” is the development, refinement and culmination of cultural changes that began ten thousand years ago.<br />
<br />
In turn, in order to understand modern civilization, we need to look even farther back, at how humans lived before we became “modern and civilized” and what happened to push our species across that threshold.<br />
<br />
Human beings have been around in one form or another for two and a half million years, first as homo habilis, then as homo erectus, and finally as homo sapiens. For virtually all of those 2.5 million years, we lived in harmony with our environment. While it may not always have been a comfortable life (how could it have been, without color cable television or cars?), we were nonetheless perfectly adapted to our habitat. This statement is supported by two facts: over most of that period our presence caused little or no damage to the planetary biosphere; and during that time the human population was essentially stable, growing to only 5 million or so in two and a half million years, for a net addition of a scant two people per year.<br />
<br />
Recently there have been some remarkable discoveries about the quality of life in the times before modern civilization. We have always known that society back then consisted of hunter-gatherers, organized as tribes. The classical impression was that the lives of these savages were, in the words of Thomas Hobbes, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. Recent investigations have shown that in fact hunter-gatherer societies enjoyed a remarkable quality of life characterized by low levels of effort, plenty of leisure time, good nutrition, low levels of disease, egalitarianism, very low levels of suicide, homicide and warfare, a high degree of personal autonomy and close-knit communities. In the words of Marshall Sahlins, hunter-gatherers were “the original affluent society.” In one of our more damaging semantic restatements we have defined “subsistence” living as bad and “sustainable” living as good – even though in the context of a hunter-gatherer society, they mean exactly the same thing.<br />
<br />
So here we have a species that was exquisitely adapted to its environment, living an affluent yet sustainable life, treading lightly on the earth, never outgrowing or overrunning its habitat, at least in terms of the species as a whole. We lived in this harmony with our world for two and a half million years, or 99.6% of the time we have been on the planet. Then suddenly, in the last ten thousand years – a mere 0.4% eye blink of time – our population increased over 1000 times, we decimated the earth’s stocks of non-renewable resources, we cut down over 90% of the planet’s forests, we fished her oceans to the edge of extinction, and we live in a near-constant state of conflict with each other. In this grievously short time we have brought about all the wicked problems listed above. Pardon my French, but what the hell happened?<br />
<br />
In a word, it was agriculture.<br />
<br />
About 10,000 years ago humanity developed organized, settled agriculture. Over the next couple of thousand years our predominant social model changed from hunter-gatherers to cultivators. We settled down (as one has to, to raise crops), and started to form larger social structures – villages, towns and cities. Nobody is precisely sure why we developed agriculture, when our previous ways of life had been perfectly satisfactory for millions of years. It may have been precipitated by climate changes, or growing populations in some areas, or it may have been just one of those things. There is no doubt that the threshold of radical human change is clearly demarcated by fields of grain.<br />
<br />
Hierarchy<br />
The shift to settled cultivation entrained a host of other changes. Our diet was dramatically impoverished. Levels of chronic disease and malnutrition increased. Levels of social violence escalated. However, the most significant change was the introduction of hierarchies that had not previously existed in our social systems.<br />
<br />
Why the development of agriculture resulted in the simultaneous appearance of social hierarchies is still a matter of debate. My opinion is that it happened because the risk to farming communities from crop failures was very high. If the crops failed, these communities contained too many people to survive on local foraging or hunting – both because population densities were so high and because the habitat destruction caused by farming had reduced the amount of local wild food. There was also no way to bring in food from some other unaffected region. Therefore the risk of crop failures had to be mitigated. This mitigation involved many activities. For example, local hunting kept larger crop-eating pests at bay, irrigation helped in times of drought, and shamanic intercession took care of storms and blights.<br />
<br />
Each of these activities of hunter, irrigation engineer and shaman was highly specialized in comparison to the more generic farming skills required for planting and harvesting. Such specialization conferred power on the holders of those skills. This was especially true in the case of shamans, whose power could not be entirely learned, but was said to emanate come from a mysterious connection with the supernatural. Their attempt to exercise control over nature gave the shamans the real ability to exercise control over other people however (”Obey me or the gods will frown on us, and the crop failure will be your fault!”), and the first systematic hierarchies were born.<br />
<br />
Surplus<br />
The other significant change introduced by organized agriculture was the psychological effect of reliable surpluses of food. While the previous two and a half million years of our existence had been shaped by sustainable subsistence, agriculture introduced the possibility of producing more food than we needed, letting us distribute the required amount to the members of the community and store the excess.<br />
<br />
Centralizing the production of food and managing its distribution reinforced the development of hierarchies. Since some of the food was needed by people who had no direct hand in producing it (such as weavers, shamans and granary guards), some means had to be found of giving them equitable access to it. This meant coming up with a way of defining relative values for different kinds of work, and establishing a medium of exchange. In one stroke the concepts of money and wages appeared, resulting in a further transfer of power to those who established the value of work and controlled the money supply (and indirectly the access to food).<br />
<br />
As important as that development was, there was yet another fundamental cultural change brought about by the simple existence of a food surplus. For the previous two and a half million years, human wants had been satisfied by the concept of “enough”. People worked until they had enough, then they stopped. Now there was almost always “more than enough”. The perception that there was more than enough food caused a radical change in how we looked at the world.<br />
<br />
Food surpluses and the development of a medium of exchange made trade for non-food goods possible. The continued trade of ongoing food surpluses enabled a continuous growth in the material comfort of peoples’ lives. It did not take long for people to become accustomed to this new state of affairs. As memories of the past faded over just a few generations, the new conditions of growing abundance were rapidly accepted as the “natural” order of things.<br />
<br />
Modern Civilization<br />
We now have the two critical preconditions for “modern civilization”. The first is the belief that a continuous growth in material prosperity is the natural order of the human universe. The second is the belief that a power hierarchy is essential for the smooth functioning of the system.<br />
<br />
As always happens with hierarchies, power flows uphill. Along with it go the perquisites of power, the most important being the right to higher levels of material abundance than those lower in the pecking order. In order to ensure that this comfortable situation is maintained, part of the accumulated social power is used to protect the situation. This is done by strongly defending the two fundamental preconditions: the idea that both material growth and the need for hierarchy are natural, essential and unquestionable. Indeed, the status quo is best served if the rest of the community sees this situation as simply part of the matrix of the universe, the only possible way life could work, and that any suggestions to the contrary are the result of either some nefarious agenda or outright insanity.<br />
<br />
Guardian Institutions<br />
Over the centuries an interlocking system of guardian institutions has grown up to protect and defend the two key ideas of growth and hierarchy.<br />
<br />
Our economic and financial institutions cooperate with business and industry to set the value of work and control the money supply (thereby controlling access to food). In this role it doesn’t make any difference whether an economy is capitalist, socialist or communist. The core belief it guards is always the same one.<br />
<br />
Our educational institutions teach successive generations how the system works, giving them the tools to integrate into it and manipulate it at the same time as training them to see this as the only possible way the world could work.<br />
Our communications media reinforce this message by enlisting people in the growth paradigm. They do this both though overt messages like advertising and covert messages embedded in the story lines of entertainment.<br />
Our religious institutions (as distinct from the religions they purport to enshrine) are primarily normative social structures. Many incorporate an overt message that one should be content with things as they are. There are often injunctions against questioning authority, as all authority is seen to devolve from the supernatural – just as it did for the shamans of the early agricultural era.<br />
Our legal institutions enforce the norms of hierarchy in ways too numerous to count. These range from the protection of privilege (one law for the rich, one for the poor) to the preferential defense of property rights over human rights.<br />
Our political institutions sit at the tip of the pyramid. Political institutions encode, enshrine and manage the application of social power. Politics is the institution that legitimizes all the others. Because of its unique ability to make laws and its access to the legalized violence that defends those laws, politics is the fullest expression of the power hierarchy of modern civilization.<br />
At the base of the hierarchy, supporting it all, are an ever-diminishing number of farmers who apply ever-increasing amounts of knowledge, technology and petroleum to ensure an ever-expanding supply of food. Because at the core it is their food that makes the whole edifice possible.<br />
<br />
So where does that put us in relation to the array of wicked problems we listed at the beginning? Simply put, every one of these problems is the result of unbridled growth. They are the logical results of the continual exercise of the first precondition of modern civilization, the drummer we have been marching to for ten thousand years since the invention of agriculture.<br />
<br />
Why politics is the problem, not the solution<br />
In light of this analysis it should be obvious why we are repeatedly failing to address any of these wicked problems. The only permanent “solution” to any of them is the secession of growth. That idea is anathema to our guardian institutions. And as the occupants of the pinnacle of power, our politicians have every reason to derail efforts in that direction, no matter how small.<br />
<br />
Politics, regardless of party or ideology, is part of the problem and can never be part of the solution. While it may be easier for the average person to live under the rule of a more humane parcel of rogues, at its heart politics is the primary guardian institution of modern civilization. The role of all politics is to ensure that power is managed, and power is always managed for the benefit of the holders of power. It doesn’t matter whether the power managers are Democrats, Republicans, Tories, Grits, Social Democrats, Communists or a military junta. They all fulfill the same role in service of the same beneficiaries.<br />
<br />
In order to fulfill that role they unite with the other guardian institutions – the economic, industrial, legal. religious, educational and communications organizations. Together these institutions create, maintain and guard a noetic milieu (a globalized intuitive, non-rational consciousness) in which any values that challenge the two fundamental preconditions to modern civilization are seen as incomprehensible, self-evidently absurd, dangerous or even insane. Since the primary value system these guardians protect is the paradigm of continuous material growth, the most dangerous of all radical ideas are any proposals to limit, halt or reverse that growth.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
The influences of our guardian institutions are firmly embedded in our global culture. They have such power and such general support at all levels of society that it is ultimately fruitless to try and remove them from power by either direct or indirect confrontation. The penalties for trying this are severe and ruthlessly applied.<br />
<br />
In light of this, is there any hope for a return to a sustainable, egalitarian, interconnected, considerate and just civilization? I strongly believe that there is, but getting there will be neither sure nor easy.<br />
<br />
The institutions that stand between us and such a future are trapped by their dependence on the very paradigm they are sworn to protect. They defend the belief that permanent material growth is natural, possible and inevitable. While they defend that belief with laws, guns and television, ultimately their power comes from people who accept that premise. If people stop believing that such growth is possible the institutions’ power declines, no matter how many defense mechanisms they engage. If growth falters, the people lose faith and the institutions crack and crumble.<br />
<br />
Look back at the list of problems that led off the article. Every single one of them is the result of our growth encountering limits. While we may be able to figure out ways to temporarily circumvent some of these limits, the pattern is now clear. The growth of modern civilization is slowing down, and is even showing evidence of coming to a halt. For a guardian institution that depends on growth for its very survival, this is like a diagnosis of terminal cancer.<br />
<br />
What that means is that these institutions will inevitably start losing their monolithic top-down power. This dis-integration will leave “cracks in the sidewalk of civilization”. And just as grass grows through cracks in real concrete, small communities and individuals will start to appear through the metaphorical concrete of our industrial civilization.<br />
<br />
No one can predict when, where or how the dis-integration will appear. It will take different forms in different places. The response of the guardians will probably be violently draconian in most cases. But there are places where communities have already formed in anticipation of such an opportunity. Like “Gaia’s antibodies” they will work to heal the wounds, widen the cracks, and let the sunshine and fresh air revitalize the hidden earth. As the seed stock of the next phase of civilization they will spread their values on the wind.<br />
<br />
The next cycle of human experience on this planet will be very different from any that has gone before. We will have fewer resources, but more knowledge. We will have to deal with toxic landscapes, a warming climate, shifting rainfall patterns and the emergence of new diseases. To balance that we will have better communications and longer memories than any civilization that has gone before us. We will not fall back into the stone age, but neither will we motor off happily into the sunset in our electric cars. There will be hardship and misery, but there will also be joy – the joy that comes from looking forward, from participating in our communities, from the love of those around us. Above all, there will be the future.<br />

		<p>Keep going, Heather. Very best wishes for 2009.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all you are doing to protect the environs from wanton, irreversible degradation and global biodiversity from massive extirpation; to preserve Earth's resources from relentless dissipation and the future of our children from reckless endangerment; to save "the pale blue dot" from the ravages of unbridled global overproduction, overconsumption and overpopulation activities of the human species in these early years of Century XXI.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Steven Earl Salmony, 3-30-09</b>
		<p>Nothing I can think of can be more vital to a good enough future for the children than a global flow of ideas regarding the population dynamics of the human species on Earth. A virtual mountain of scientific knowledge supports the near-universal understanding that a finite planet with the size, composition and frangible ecology of Earth cannot be expected to much longer support an endlessly growing number of human beings worldwide, many too many of whom appear to be willfully choosing to increase in an unbridled way their conspicuous per-capita consumption and unnecessary overproduction of stuff.<br />
<br />
With the hope of promoting necessary discussion of the subject of global human population growth, I would like to share a recent email from one of our most respected colleagues, Dr. Gary Peters, a splendid contributor to the blogosphere.<br />
<br />
begin----<br />
<br />
"Steve has mentioned the work below but I'm not sure how many of you have actually been able to look at it. It is solid and worth your time, especially if you have an interest in population growth and any variation on the idea of sustainability.<br />

<br />
P.S. For those who like such data, the world population now grows by close to 220,000 people per day."<br />
<br />

<br />
If you will, please rigorously examine the presentation, World Food and Human Population Growth.<br />
<br />
Usual objections to the research of Russell Hopfenberg, Ph.D. and David Pimentel, Ph.D., have focused the human community's attention upon "Demographic Transition Theory." Although this theory is descriptive in character, the demographic transition theory has been widely shared, consensually validated and erroneously deployed, by many too many demographers and economists in particular, as a tool for effectively predicting the end of population growth soon and the automatic stabilization of the human population on Earth in the middle of Century XXI.<br />
<br />
With remarkable clarity the research of human population dynamics by Hopfenberg and Pimentel shows us that, as a predictor of the increase or decrease of absolute global human population numbers, the theory of the demographic transition is fatally flawed and directly contradicted by more adequate scientific evidence.<br />
<br />
While the theory of the demographic transition does offer a useful historical view of recent patterns of human population growth, its value as a tool to forecast the increase or decrease the population numbers of the human species worldwide can now be seen, in the light of new research, as fundamentally defective.<br />
<br />
If the human family continues choosing to keep doing precisely what we are doing now as absolute global human population numbers skyrocket toward a projected 9+ billion people, can reason or common sense possibly support the idea that future outcomes regarding human population growth will be any different either from the results we are seeing now or the results which have been occurring throughout recorded history?<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone will kindly explain what you think will happen that would effectively lead to the stabilization of population numbers of the human species in the year 2050, given the fully anticipated young age distribution of the global human population at that time?<br />
<br />
At the midpoint of the twenty-first century, what do you suppose hundreds upon hundreds of millions of fertile young people, who are expected to be capable of reproducing, will be doing with their sexual drives and instincts other than what their ancestors did for thousands of years?<br />
<br />
Psychologists have often commented about such circumstances in this manner: doing the same things over and over again while fully expecting that a new succession of events will somehow magically occur is an example of extreme foolishness.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Steven Earl Salmony, 3-11-10</b>
		<p>Let's consider for a moment that many hundreds of millions of poor people are going hungry today and at the same time that a tiny minority of a few million foolhardy, arrogant and avaricious people among us are recklessly engaged in conspicuous consumption, excessive hoarding and wanton pollution activities which lead to natural resource dissipation, environmental degradation and climate destabilization as well as threaten to ruin Earth as fit place for habitation by children everywhere.  <br />
<br />
It appears that we are presented here with two problems: addressing the needs of hungry poor people and the looming ecological wreckage that could result from unbridled greediness of the rich and powerful.  <br />
<br />
How can we simultaneously overcome both of these human-induced global challenges?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? Plans of action?</p>

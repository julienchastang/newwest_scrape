							Iâ€™m not even thirty yet, and Iâ€™m already crotchety.  I thought I had a good forty years ahead of me before I began shaking my fist at the youth of America, but sadly, itâ€™s already begun.  The University of Coloradoâ€™s students are back in Boulder, over 28,000 of them, and they are making their presence felt everywhere they roam.  Itâ€™s not that I have anything against the students, individuallyâ€”my little brother is a junior at CU this year, one of my cousins is a senior, and a dear little girl that I used to babysit when I was a teenager is starting her freshman year.  But as an aggregate, the studentsâ€™ sudden reappearance is a bit of a jolt after a typically quiet summer in Boulder.  The 2000 census estimated that there were about 70,000 non-student residents of Boulder, so when the kids swarm back in, that makes for a population increase of about forty percent.  <br />
<br />
More personally, I live in a condo complex whose units are filled with a mix of owners and renters, and when the student renters return, itâ€™s hard not to notice them.  Especially if you happen to have an enormous willow tree fall on your condo.  As I found out last week, downed willow trees are a magnet for loud, drunken young people.  And based on the dialogue I heard as they congregated under my bedroom window at all hours, <i>Beavis & Butthead</i> was not satire.<br />
<br />
Last Wednesday, after a tremendously windy day, I arrived home at around 5 oâ€™clock, just in time to witness the immense willow tree behind our condo crack in two and fall on our place, collapsing the roof over the upstairs porch.  (As I type this, I am listening to the roofers scuttle around above me like disconcertingly large squirrels.)  It was late in the day, but the HOAâ€™s tree trimming contractor made it out for an emergency consultation.  He reeked of alcohol and cigarettes and looked like Nick Nolte coming off a bender; my confidence was not inspired.  A crew could begin work the next morning, but until then, the tree would lay propped on our condo, attracting neighbors from miles around, who would wander over and observe, â€œA tree fell on your house!â€?  Weâ€™d nod and assure them that weâ€™d noticed.  After nightfall, our new student neighbors were attracted to the site, and throughout the night many of them walked by and exclaimed, â€œHoly shit!â€?  <br />
<br />
The next day the tree trimmers cut off all the limbs, but they couldnâ€™t move the trunk until they were able to get a crane in from Denver.  That meant another night with the tree on our house.  Some time after midnight, a group of three obviously intoxicated and obviously teenaged boys stopped by and engaged in a repartee that largely consisted of exclamations of  â€œDude!â€? followed by bursts of maniacal giggling.  Finally, my husband went out and said, â€œExcuse me, weâ€™re trying to sleep up here!â€?  The boys giggled some more and then one said, â€œOkay, weâ€™ll move.  Youâ€™ve already had enough bad luck for the week.â€?  We both felt about seventy years old, fuming, <i>Those rotten kids!</i><br />
<br />
Besides producing a lot more noise than other occupants of the condo complex, the student renters all seem to have dogs, and their dogs crap everywhere, and no one picks it up.  Who just wrote that sentence?  Was it me?  I <i>like</i> dogs.  But clearly the advent of my crotchety years is upon me, and it took the return of students to Boulder for me to realize it.

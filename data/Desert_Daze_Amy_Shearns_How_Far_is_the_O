	Amy Shearn&#8217;s surefooted debut novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Far-Ocean-Here-Novel/dp/0307405346/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219003956&amp;sr=8-1" title="How Far is the Ocean From Here">How Far is the Ocean From Here</a></I> transports readers to the &#8220;godforsaken fleabag&#8221; Thunder Lodge motel in the middle of a stretch of desert &#8220;somewhere between West Texas and East New Mexico,&#8221; the last place you&#8217;d think the nine-month-pregnant protagonist, Susannah Prue, would want to be in high summer.&nbsp; In the time-honored tradition followed by those who&#8217;ve made a hash of their lives, Susannah is fleeing west.&nbsp; She is serving as the surrogate mother for a wealthy couple, and with the due date two weeks away, she impulsively drives out of Chicago and fetches up at the Thunder Lodge.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Susannah is forced to settle in there after Marlon Garland, who owns the Lodge with his surly wife Char, pronounces the engine of her car dead.&nbsp; While Susannah incubates the baby with no particular plan in mind, she comes to enjoy the company of Tim, the Garlands&#8217; handsome, mentally disabled teenage son, and the only other two guests who check in during her stay: Frankie, a child of ambiguous gender raised against her will as a girl, and Frankie&#8217;s aunt Dicey, who is transporting her across country to live with her father.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the sophisticated middle-aged power couple, Julian and Kit Forsythe, whose baby is in Susannah&#8217;s womb, set out in pursuit.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
From this array of characters, which at first seems as arbitrary as any random group of guests at a motel, Shearn sets in motion a gripping plot and creates a desert society that functions like many desert societies must, with people becoming involved in each other&#8217;s lives simply because there are so few people to go around.&nbsp; Three characters who form a team by the end of the novel all have in common the threshold status of their lives&#8212;Susannah stuck somewhere between youth and almost-motherhood, Frankie between male and female, and Tim between child and man, all of them marooned in an especially barren stretch of desert that is &#8220;unvaried by cactus or tree, unstirred by lizard or coyote, undimpled by even a shadow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Shearn gradually reveals that Susannah became a surrogate because she was suffering from a mid-twenties angst, having failed to make much of her life yet.&nbsp; Her longtime boyfriend recently broke up with her, leaving her to continue to work at a Chicago bookstore.&nbsp; One day she had the idea to break herself out of her rut with a grand, decisive gesture, and answered an ad for a surrogate.&nbsp; The mild angst of educated twenty-somethings can often make for a &#8220;so what?&#8221; read, but Shearn avoids this trap by forcing Susannah to encounter people whose problems are thornier than her own.&nbsp; But Shearn especially evades tedium through the humor, liveliness, and inventiveness of her language.&nbsp; Although for many parts of the novel, Susannah and the other characters do little but lounge around the pool or rest in their air-conditioned rooms, <I>How Far is the Ocean From Here</I> is never dull because of Shearn&#8217;s winning language.
</p>
<p>
Shearn&#8217;s descriptions of what it feels like to be pregnant are funny and accurate: &#8220;The baby was restless.&nbsp; He was a contrary one, you could tell, and as soon as she wanted to rest, he started practicing his moves&#8212;it was like he was training for some sort of dance off in there, some sort of cross-country-runningish thing&#8212;and as soon as she was awake, he was as still as the dead.&#8221; When Susannah faints at one point, she rebukes herself, &#8220;She&#8217;d never fainted in her life.&nbsp; God!&nbsp; The whole thing had been so <I>pregnant</I> of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Shearn&#8217;s descriptions of the desert&#8212;of what people expect the desert to be and what the desert actually is&#8212;are also insightful: &#8220;To the amateur, like Susannah, a desert is an abstraction, a metaphor, a Hollywood soundstage for hatchet-faced cowpokes and horses in symbolic colors, a cartoon involving a parched rider on a knobby-kneed horse and palm-treed mirages that rise shimmering from the sand.&nbsp; But here at the Thunder Lodge, there was a different kind of desperateness.&nbsp; The earth wore a colorless skin of dust, rashy with outcroppings of low-lying, dead-looking shrubs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Amy Shearn&#8217;s <I>How Far is the Ocean From Here</I> is an appealing novel, showcasing a new talent whose wit will make readers happy to follow her anywhere, even to a &#8220;godforsaken fleabag&#8221; motel in the middle of the desert.

		<h1>YourHub Actually Good for Something</h1>

							This May, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com" title="Denver Post">Denver Post</a> began a new journalistic venture called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yourhub.com" title="YourHub">YourHub</a>. <i>YourHub</i> features news tailored to different metro Denver communities, with fresh web content and a print issue of the appropriate neighborhood included once a week in the newspapers of subscribers to the <i>Rocky</i> or <i>Post</i>.  While <i>YourHub</i> was meant to spur citizen journalism, with most of the content eventually written by average Joes and Jills, so far most of the stuff that has been turning up in the Boulder print edition has been authored or photographed by <i>YourHub</i> employees.  Apparently, the cadre of non-professional journalists who enjoy writing for free are already too busy penning irate letters to the editor, updating their own blogs, or scrawling messages on the walls of bar restrooms.  Still, the <i>YourHub</i> print edition is amusing to page through for its dispiriting mÃ©lange of poorly composed photographs, high school graduation listings, and self-promotion by local bands.<br />
<br />
But <i>YourHub</i> may redeem itself yet, as it now includes the most perennially reader-pleasing item of any community newspaper: The police blotter.  The police blotter, better than any other news feature, captures the pulse of a community, detailing mayhem too minor to make the front page of local papers. Last weekâ€™s edition of <a target="_blank" href="http://yourhub.com/default.aspx?tabid=1108&contentid=9010" title="Crimes reported by the Boulder Police">Crimes reported by the Boulder Police</a> was a minor classic of the form.  There was the young woman who rode her bicycle into some guyâ€™s car, forcefully enough to break the taillight and dent the bumper.  There was the man who reported heâ€™d been socked in the ear by a man with â€œcrazy eyes.â€?  But the incident that is the most illuminating of Boulder as a community was the case of the over-zealous life coach.<br />
<br />
According to <i>YourHub</i>, â€œAn intoxicated life coach was issued a summons for obstructing a peace officer after she tried to help a young couple resolve a dispute outside of their apartment building.â€?  For the uninitiated, a â€œlife coach,â€? basically, is a quasi-therapist hired to goad people into making choices that will allow them to achieve greater fulfillment in their lives.  And thatâ€™s right, Boulder is apparently so flush with life coaches that they actually rove the streets at night, offering their services to whomever they find engaged in a non-proactive interaction.  Free, freelance life coaches are kind of like super heroes in that way.  <br />
<br />
But did the distressed couple actually <i>want</i> this life coachâ€™s help?  Not according to <i>YourHub</i>: â€œA 25-year-old woman and her 26-year-old boyfriend admitted to police that they had been arguing when they were approached by a strange woman who tried to get involved with their conversation, much to their chagrin.â€?  The couple seemed to believe they were doing everyone a favor by taking their noisy argument outside instead of disturbing the residents inside their building.  But any time you enter public property in Boulder, you assume the risk that a life coach will catch you doing something that will hinder your self-actualizationâ€”say, eating a third jelly donut, taking a nap instead of plowing through Tolstoy as you intended, or preparing to car surfâ€”and then youâ€™re in for a lecture like none youâ€™ve ever heard.<br />
<br />
By keeping citizens apprised of such dangers, <i>YourHub</i> is finally performing a useful function, in addition to catering to the lowest common denominator by satisfying town busybodies who enjoy a good, gossipy police blotter.  Now if they would only run some obituaries adjacent to notices about the associated, newly-available real estate, <i>YourHub</i> readership will take off like gangbusters.

		<b>Comment By Andy, 7-20-05</b>
		<p>I love the idea of citizen journalism, but YourHub isnâ€™t pulling it off. It doesnâ€™t help that the YourHub website is impossible to navigate. <br />
<br />
Perhaps Coloradoâ€™s flagship newspapers should shift the resources going into YourHub toward more community coverage within their existing papers and websites. <br />
<br />
Leaving it entirely up to citizens doesnâ€™t work. It would be interesting if each paper had a couple of full-time journalists who facilitate community stories by finding interesting people and helping them structure and write their own stories.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Temple, 7-31-05</b>
		<p>I appreciate Andy's suggestion. But perhaps he doesn't understand how YourHub.com works. We do have journalists assigned to each Web site and section, and they do contact people in the community and help them write or post stories, and they do write and post original stories themselves. In other words, we aren't leaving it entirely up to citizens. But we do believe that our YourHub.com journalists are facilitators in a way that writers for other sections of the Rocky aren't. Hope this helps.<br />

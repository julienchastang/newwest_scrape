	The career of Oregon writer Floyd Skloot has endured through numerous remarkable acts.&nbsp; He started out as a poet, then wrote short stories and novels, publishing widely.&nbsp; As he reports in the preface to his new book, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Wink-Zenith-Shaping-Writers-Life/dp/0803211198/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224473558&amp;sr=8-1" title="The Wink of the Zenith">The Wink of the Zenith</a></I>, in 1988 when he was 41, he &#8220;contracted a virus that targeted my brain and left me in neurological tatters.&#8221;  After a period of painful recovery during which he couldn&#8217;t write, he gradually began to collect &#8220;scattered images and phrases.&#8221;  He decided to write about what was happening to him, and the result was his previous three acclaimed memoirs about his illness, <i>The Night-Side</i>, <I>In the Shadow of Memory</I> and <I>A World of Light</I>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Skloot returns to the memoir form for his new book, this time reaching back to his childhood and young adulthood to try to piece together the memories that had vanished, a task made more difficult because he is the last surviving member of the family in which he grew up.&nbsp; The result is a poignant, vivid collection of essays that tell the story of Skloot&#8217;s formation as a writer.&nbsp; Through these essays, which are honest, funny, self-deprecating, and deeply introspective without being egocentric, Skloot emerges as an endearing character.
</p>
<p>
Despite Skloot&#8217;s memory impairment, the essays are seamless, teeming with convincing detail, so it is a surprise to learn from &#8220;The Voice of the Past&#8221; toward the end of the book that he worked on hunches and fragments to reconstruct his history, and benefited from the input of long lost friends and acquaintances who wrote or called to fill him in on details they remembered.&nbsp; Skloot wrote an essay about his demanding, eccentric mother for the New York Times Magazine, mentioning that &#8220;she&#8217;d been, she always said, radio&#8217;s Melody Girl of the Air in the mid-1930s, star of her own show on WBNX in the Bronx.&#8221;  The fact checkers couldn&#8217;t confirm this detail, and given what we learn of the narcissism of Skloot&#8217;s mother, the reader might join them in their doubts, but Skloot felt that it was true, and his belief was confirmed when a ninety-year-old man from Florida called to say he&#8217;d read the essay and used to drive Skloot&#8217;s mother to the radio station where she worked.&nbsp; Before and since then, other people have read Skloot&#8217;s writings and contacted him, sharing precious details of his past.
</p>
<p>
To piece together his past, Skloot listened to old songs, watched old movies, reread books, and tried to re-experience everything he could that might spark a memory.&nbsp; Skloot&#8217;s father died when he was 14, his mother succumbed to dementia in her final years, and his brother was dying of kidney failure as he began to investigate his past.&nbsp; Skloot writes, &#8220;visits to [my brother&#8217;s] California apartment would often include long periods of silence, then a word or phrase from one of us might spark a glimmer of memory.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
One of the best essays is &#8220;The Summer of the Vampire,&#8221; in which Skloot writes about being sent home from summer camp when he was eleven after coming down with mononucleosis.&nbsp; Skloot&#8217;s volatile mother forbids him to leave his bed for several lonely months (though he sneaks around the house a bit when she is out), and a man who comes to draw his blood for the laboratory visits him once a week.&nbsp; Skloot thought of the man as &#8220;Mr. Vampire.&#8221;  &#8220;He loomed in the long hallway,&#8221; Skloot writes, &#8220;dressed always in a black suit, black tie, black socks and shoes, white shirt.&#8221;  Despite his somber appearance, Mr. Vampire is a Mark Twain enthusiast and presents Skloot with <I>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#8217;s Court</I>, which Skloot enjoys so thoroughly that it prompts him to read more books instead of the comics and Classics Illustrated comics that he favored. 
</p>
<p>
Another great essay is &#8220;Home Economics for Halfbacks,&#8221; in which Skloot writes of his experimentation with cooking that began in high school.&nbsp; By this time his father was dead, his older brother was out of the house, and his mother had taken a job as a travel agent that allowed her to frequently leave on months-long trips, during which she trolled for a new husband.&nbsp; Skloot was a conscientious teenager and obeyed all rules except one&#8212;his mother forbade him to cook while she was away, and flew into a rage when she returned home to find some telltale splatters in the oven.&nbsp; &#8220;&#8216;How dare you?&#8221; she shrieked.&nbsp; &#8216;Because of you, I&#8217;ll never meet a man.&#8217;&#8221; But Skloot couldn&#8217;t resist cooking, trying to stretch the limited money she left him and applying lessons learned at school in Chef&#8217;s Course for Males, taught by his football coach.
</p>
<p>
In &#8220;Numbers,&#8221; Skloot writes about when he and his first wife were expecting their first child and he decided he needed to leave the world of academia and take a job with better pay.&nbsp; He decided to apply for a job with the Governor of Illinois&#8217; Bureau of the Budget, though he had no experience in this field.&nbsp; Through a series of improbable occurrences, Skloot gets the job despite wearing a hideous suit to the interview: 
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It was a souvenir of my travels through Europe during the summer of 1969, purchased in London during the Beatles&#8217; waning psychedelic phase and looking like something from the cover of their 1969 <I>Yellow Submarine</I> album.&nbsp; The suit had been stylish that year, a mustard-yellow-and-brown check with oddly tapered lapels that looked serrated, and I had my doubts about how management at the Illinois Bureau of the Budget might respond to it.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
On the day of the interview in Springfield, he leaves his suit pants at home, and so must wear the turquoise jeans he&#8217;d brought with him along with the suit coat and a fuschia shirt.&nbsp; Even after this fashion faux pas, Skloot is hired and throws himself into the job, giving up writing for a time.&nbsp; But then he returns to writing with a dedication that ultimately paid off.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most touching aspects of <I>The Wink of the Zenith</I> is Skloot&#8217;s attitude toward his mother.&nbsp; She is an extremely difficult woman, constantly browbeating her family, verbally and physically abusing Skloot, prone to delusions of grandeur and ceaselessly complaining about her lot in life.&nbsp; And though he reports her behavior, he writes of her with no malice, and in the moving &#8220;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&#8221; and &#8220;Shine On,&#8221; he details how during her last years in the nursing home when she was suffering from dementia, they communicated primarily through songs that she used to sing.&nbsp; When Skloot was a boy, she once smacked him across the face for singing along with her, and insisted &#8220;I&#8217;m the singer in this family!&#8221;  Her loss of memory gentled her, turned her into a crooner that Skloot could harmonize with at last.&nbsp; Skloot&#8217;s attitude of forgiveness and understanding toward a mother that he&#8217;d have every right to vilify is refreshing, and may be one of the gifts of his impaired memory.&nbsp; He can reflect on her with love, unmarred by the sting of resentment that sharp childhood recollections might bring.
</p>
<p>
It struck me in reading <I>The Wink of the Zenith</I> that the composition of any extended work feels, to the writer, like the painstaking creation of a flip book that kids make when they are young enough to enjoy yawning stretches of unstructured time, carefully creating one drawing after another with minute variations that they hope will result in a convincing animation.&nbsp; It takes so long to complete that the writer might have no idea how what they&#8217;ve written will play before the reader when they finally flip through the pages.&nbsp; Given his impaired memory, Skloot&#8217;s process of constructing the pieces that add up to his book was even more protracted and difficult than it is for most of us, but it moves together grandly, creating for the reader a full-color portrait of Skloot&#8217;s boyhood that rings with authenticity.

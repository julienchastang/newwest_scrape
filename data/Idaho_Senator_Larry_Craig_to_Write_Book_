		<p>Bad joke politicians seem to never go away.  Worse,  some never seem to lose an election.  And when they seem to be going away,  as ungracefully as possible,  they leave with a book deal.  Craig is going to write a book.  What possibly could he say that would be of importance or needed?  He got caught being obnoxious in public,  tried to pull the "U.S. Senate" card,  and failed.  Then he did the lawyer thing,  and tried to negate his guilty plea.  <br />
<br />
No personal responsibility.  He has no sense of personal responsibility to others,  most of all his family and the woman who stood behind him.  How could he explain all that in a book that anyone would want to read except for others in public life and the talking heads who must report on all that icky stuff?  And he has no personal identity with his own wrong doing.  Puffery and posturing,  a radio voice,  and a severe look about him is all that he has had to offer.  Now he offers that as a defense to stupidity,  a false life,  lies,  and his disgracing his office and his own private Idaho.<br />
<br />
If you really want to have some fun,  attend your State Fair this summer or fall,  and be sure to see the Poultry exhibits.  While you are in the Poultry exhibits,  start looking at the strutting, preening birds as Senators and Congressmen or Congresswomen.  With sufficient imagination,  you can have a really fun time.  Roosters,  pigeons, ducks,  turkeys,  all have an air of dignity and stupidity that lights up the room.  I have seen pigeons that are Byrd of WVA,  and those ones with the funny hair pieces that look like Biden's plugs on steroids.  Chickens in vests,  and pomaded pompadours, clucking and crowing.  Ducks waddling to the lectern.  I see a big old white leghorn rooster and there is former Senator Fritz Hollings of S. Carolina,  Phoghorn hisself.<br />
<br />
Which then brings me to where the Library of Congress will place the Craig book.  Will it be under "poultry"  or "poetry" or "potty?"</p>

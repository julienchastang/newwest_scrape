							I began noticing Christmas items for sale in Boulder stores last week, red and green gift wrap mingling with Halloween pumpkins and candy.  The phenomenon of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_creep" title="Christmas creep">Christmas creep</a> is nothing new--as <a target="_blank" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1330&CFID=1755256&CFTOKEN=89918504" title="this article ">this article </a>notes, retailers have been introducing holiday items earlier and earlier in order to benefit from the added sales.  While I'm generally annoyed when I see Christmas items in October, there's one holiday essential that I wish would arrive in stores even earlier: Celestial Seasonings' Nutcracker Sweet Tea.  I noticed a woman buying the Boulder-based tea brand's Sugar Plum Spice holiday tea at Whole Foods last week, but when I went to the tea area, I found that all the Celestial Seasonings' holiday teas were stocked <i>except</i> for Nutcracker Sweet.<br />
<br />
I first tried Nutcracker Sweet when a friend who said she was "addicted" to it supplied it.  For once a product lived up the hype.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/holiday-teas/nutcracker-sweet.html" title="The Celestial Seasonings website">The Celestial Seasonings website</a> describes the tea like this: "This irresistible treat is a blend of the finest black teas from the estates of Assam, Kenya and Indonesia. Then we add vanilla and nutty flavors and a dash of cinnamon."  I found that I preferred it to almost every other bagged tea.  <br />
<br />
The problem is that this is a "limited edition" tea that Celestial Seasonings only produces for a few months a year.  I began to hoard it as the holiday season drew to a close.  But I could never hoard enough.  Last year I stockpiled four boxes of it, thinking that was enough.  But I blew through them all, and even took a box from my mother, and still I was out of the stuff by May.  You would think that because I live in Boulder, the very town where the Celestial Seasonings factory is located, I could find an off-season supplier.  But I've had no such luck.<br />
<br />
I spoke to a woman stocking the tea shelf at Whole Foods, and asked her why all the other holiday teas were out but not Nutcracker Sweet.  She said that she'd put the holiday teas out a little early, and that most people start looking for them in November.  The problem is that the Nutcracker Sweet box has a vertical orientation this year, so she didn't have space for it yet.  "I could probably get rid of one of the chais, and put it out some time next week," she offered.  "That would be good," I said, "because people like their Nutcracker Sweet."  She nodded, as if she'd witnessed end-of-season tea hoarding first hand.  "I know they do," she said.  <br />
<br />
Curiously, I felt like an addict having a conversation with a dealer.  Celestial Seasonings invites us to "share the warmth and cheer of the season over a cup of Nutcracker Sweet Holiday Tea."  But forget sharing.  Keep your damn hands off my tea.<br />

		<p>Jenny, not sure if you are aware, but checked the Celestial Seasonings website, and you can actually order the Nutcracker Tea online. It shows up as one you can order, and you can type in the quantity of boxes you want. Might be a better options that trying to horde all the boxes you can from Whole Foods :) And shipping might be cheaper since you are in Boulder already.<br />
<br />
Good luck! After your description, I might have to try this one this year. My favorite tea they make is the Decaf Mandarin Orchard Green Tea because it doesn't taste like the green tea bitterness I was used to tasting at Chinese restaurants when I was a kid.</p>

		<p>My addiction started three years ago, and I always went through withdrawal around February. Last year, I decided to grab whatever I could. A staffer at Whole Foods noticed me grabbing boxes and said he'd check in back, so I walked out with two 6-packs. They lasted me through to this year; I have three boxes left. So clearly I'll need to stock up again.</p>

		<p>I have been looking everywhere for it and my daughter is beginning to worry. I think I am going to have to go online and order it. I am a Nutcracker Sweet hoarder as well but I go through it really fast with my girls helping me drink it.</p>

							<p>In this week&#8217;s Roundup, I&#8217;ll be taking a look at a few of the many literary magazines in our region.
</p>
<p>
<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitefishreview.com" title="Whitefish Review">Whitefish Review</a></b> is a journal based in Whitefish, Montana, that is five issues and two years into what will hopefully be a long and fruitful run.&nbsp; Recently <I>Whitefish Review</I> gained nonprofit status from the IRS, which will allow them to seek grants and accept donations.&nbsp; In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitefishreview.com/press/press.release_2009-10-22.htm" title="a press release">a press release</a>, founding editor Brian Schott described the journal&#8217;s mission: &#8220;From the beginning, we wanted to see if we could create a non-commercial publishing venue for the increasingly sprawling network of artists, photographers, and writers in the interior American West.&#8221;  Lynette Hintze wrote a profile of the <i>Whitefish Review</i> in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitefishreview.com/press.htm" title="The Daily Interlake">The Daily Interlake</a>, in which the editors discuss how they got an interview with John Irving for the Spring 2010 issue.
</p>
<p>
<I>Whitefish Review</I> features nonfiction, fiction, poetry, art, and photography, and has published a number of the region&#8217;s best-known writers, such as Rick Bass, Terry Tempest Williams, Pam Houston, and Tim Cahill.&nbsp; But judging from the last few issues, the journal&#8217;s emphasis is on featuring new writers, including some young winners of a local high school writing contest.&nbsp; The <i>Whitefish Review</i> will have its next open submission period from January 1 through March 15.&nbsp; The next issue hits bookstores (and will be available for purchase online) on December 17.&nbsp; It will include work by London-based writer and philosopher Alain de Botton, skier Scot Schmidt, and political cartoonist Jeff Danziger.
</p>
<p>
Missoula&#8217;s <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cutbankonline.org/" title="CutBank">CutBank</a></b>, based in the University of Montana&#8217;s Creative Writing program, just extended the deadline for its Big Fish Online contest until December 1.&nbsp; They are accepting submissions of poetry, fiction, nonfiction and art for the $100 prize and publication in <I>CutBank</I> online.
</p>
<p>
The fine <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://isotope.usu.edu" title="Isotope: A Journal of Literary Nature and Science Writing">Isotope: A Journal of Literary Nature and Science Writing</a></I></b> could use some subscribers&#8212;its home base is Utah State University, and like many college-based journals, <I>Isotope</I> is facing budget cuts.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the perfect magazine for scientists with a literary bent, or poets who have a thing for rocks.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In a recent issue, two pieces celebrated their authors&#8217; passion for rocks.&nbsp; In &#8220;Mountain Eros,&#8221; Anna Mills described her experience of having a &#8221;<I>geogasm</I>&#8220;: &#8220;My raptures over the ice water, the glacier polish and the curled petals of the rein orchids approach sexual excitement.&nbsp; For a long time, I thought this unusual.&nbsp; It embarrassed and pleased me to think myself unique.&nbsp; When I began to read literature about nature, however, I found erotic feelings for rock, tree and fruit everywhere, even in the classics.&nbsp; Thoreau declares, &#8216;All nature is my bride.&#8217;  Whitman cries,  &#8216;I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,//I am mad for it to be in contact with me.&#8217;&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Poet Sheryl St. Germain agrees&#8212;her poem, &#8220;Orogeny: A Lesson in Geology,&#8221; begins: 
</p>
<blockquote><p><I>Orogeny</I> sounds too much like <I>erogenous</I>, 
<br />
so in the beginning of the geologist&#8217;s lecture
<br />
I think she&#8217;s describing a sort of erotics
<br />
of mountain building&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Several essays that first appeared in <I>Isotope</I> have been included in the anthologies <I>The Best American Science and Nature Writing</I>, <I>The Best American Essays</I>, and <I> The Best Creative Nonfiction</I>.
</p>
<p>
<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.boisestate.edu/theidahoreview/" title="The Idaho Review">The Idaho Review</a></I></b>, based at Boise State University, published its first issue ten years ago and quickly climbed to the top of the national literary magazine scene.&nbsp; It celebrated that milestone with its Tenth Anniversary Issue this year, which includes a tribute to the late Carol Houck Smith, an editor for sixty years at W.W. Norton, who discovered and nurtured many Western writers.&nbsp; Writers she worked with including Pam Houston, Rick Bass, Andrea Barrett,  Ron Carlson, and Kim Barnes offer their remembrances.&nbsp; The issue also features new work by Wyoming&#8217;s Alyson Hagy, Montana&#8217;s Pete Fromm, and Oregon&#8217;s Joseph Millar.

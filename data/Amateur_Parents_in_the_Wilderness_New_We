							We are thinking of hiring a fool for our three-month-old daughter.  When we put her on the playmat that so enraptured her two weeks ago, she immediately becomes enraged.  The swing that once lulled her to sleep only works if we attach several auxiliary toys to it, which baffles her for a few minutes before she begins to scream.  She craves constant novelty, which means we are put to work as puppeteers, minstrels, storytellers, dancers, and emitters of funny voices during almost all of her waking moments.  So it's time for a fool.  Perhaps we'd find their services under the fools and jesters section of Craig's List?  The only activity that reliably provides enough novelty and stimulus to prevent her from becoming bored is to take her outside on an excursion.  But we, being amateur parents, have recently gotten into trouble when taking our child into the great outdoors.<br />
<br />
Our baby is an excellent model for training amateur parents, because when you mess up, she doesn't sit by and endure it.  She lets you know: Immediately, forcefully, and thoroughly.  Such was the case last Friday when we took her for a hike on the mesa behind NCAR, where my husband works.  On our previous hikes and wilderness adventures, our babe has never once filled her pants--she's usually lulled to sleep after taking in all the sights and sounds, and she forgets about more quotidian business until she's returned home.  So, since this was to be a short hike in the wilderness near my husband's office, we went commando: That's right, we ventured into the woods without the diaper bag.<br />
<br />
At the exact midpoint of our journey, we heard the sound of our daughter answering nature's call.  We were without a fresh diaper, a forty-minute hike away from the office.  She began to scream, as she likes to keep herself tidy.  "I guess we just head back as fast as we can," my husband said.  "What else is there to do?"  I shook my head.  "Unless we want to wipe her down with a bunch of leaves, I don't know."  As our babe screamed, we sprinted as fast as we could back to his office, a journey that seemed at least ten times longer than the pleasant hike out.  We felt bad that we had so cavalierly left behind the diaper bag, leaving our daughter to marinate in her mess, and she let us have it, screaming the whole drive home.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, we decided she needed a breath of fresh air, so we took her out in the jogging stroller to see the sights of the bike path.  It was a little chilly, so we bundled her carefully in a sort of fleece sleeping bag that covered her up to her neck.  At the exact midpoint of our jog, winds of over fifty miles an hour kicked up, drilling us with dust, tumbleweeds, and debris.  <br />
<br />
We tried to turn the jogging stroller so it sheltered her from the wind, but there was a flap in back that allowed it to scream through.  We alternately pushed and pulled the stroller into the wind to head home, while our daughter screamed inconsolably about the terrifying wind that was whipping the canvas of the stroller and the fleece of her sleeping bag around her.  Finally, I took her out of her stroller, wrapped her in a blanket, and hugged her close as we walked home in the cruel wind.  I felt awful for putting her through this trauma.  Snuggled to my bosom, she promptly fell asleep as we battled through the wind to reach home.<br />
<br />
We are doing the best we can.  Really.  And maybe these misadventures will teach her an important life lesson about the unpredictability of nature, or at least about the fallibility of her parents.  So next weekend, it's off to see the aspen leaves, with about a dozen diapers and some sort of all-weather-repelling pod. <br />

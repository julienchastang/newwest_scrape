In the U.S., literary award givers tend to constrain themselves to a list of four or five semifinalists for a prize, but in the U.K. folks like a long, long list, and last week the people behind the Frank O&#8217;Connor International Short Story Prize announced a group of 39 challengers for this year&#8217;s &#8364;35,000 prize, as <a target="_blank" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2278198,00.html" title="the Guardian reported">the Guardian reported</a>.&nbsp; Our region has a strong contender in Oregon native <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_benjamin_percy/C39/L39/" title="Benjamin Percy'">Benjamin Percy&#8217;</a>s collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/there_will_be_blood_benjamin_percys_refresh_refresh/C132/L39/" title="Refresh, Refresh">Refresh, Refresh</a></I>, which will vie against books by such short fiction heavyweights as Roddy Doyle and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/apr/03/author-lahiri-celebrates-humanity/" title="Jhumpa Lahiri">Jhumpa Lahiri</a>.

University of Idaho creative writing professor <a target="_blank" href="http://brandonrschrand.com/" title="Brandon R. Schrand">Brandon R. Schrand</a> has received plenty of good news recently.&nbsp; He reports on his website that his essay &#8220;Eleven Ways to Consider Air&#8221; has been selected for this year&#8217;s <I>Pushcart Prize Anthology</I>.&nbsp; The essay was originally published in <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ecotonejournal.com/" title="Ecotone">Ecotone</a></I>, a magazine that describes itself as &#8220;a literary journal of place that seeks to publish creative work about the environment and the natural world while avoiding the hushed tones and clich&#233;s of much of so-called nature writing.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Schrand&#8217;s essay will also appear in the forthcoming <I><a target="_blank" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&amp;ISBN=9781597660419&amp;ourl=Borne%2Don%2DAir%2FPhil%2DDruker" title="Borne On Air: Essays by Idaho Writers">Borne On Air: Essays by Idaho Writers</a></I>, and his first book, published this week by the University of Nebraska Press, will be featured this summer in <a target="_blank" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Enders-Hotel/Brandon-R-Schrand/e/9780803217690" title="Barnes &amp; Noble's Discover Great New Writers">Barnes &amp; Noble&#8217;s Discover Great New Writers</a> program.&nbsp; Check back here Friday for my review of his new memoir, <I>The Enders Hotel</I>, about growing up in Soda Springs, Idaho.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.deannestillman.com/" title="Deanne Stillman">Deanne Stillman</a> recently interviewed Larry McMurtry in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laobserved.com/intell/2008/05/larry_mcmurtry_on_cormac_heave.php" title="LA Observed">LA Observed</a> on the occasion of his receipt of the Los Angeles Public Library Award.&nbsp; Among the insights: McMurtry sees the U.S. not as a &#8220;cowboy culture&#8221; but as a &#8220;suburban culture,&#8221; and he still doesn&#8217;t think the American West has produced a truly great book, though he allows that Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s <I>No Country for Old Men</I> is a &#8220;very good book.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Stillman&#8217;s new book, <I>Mustang: The Saga of the Wild Horse in the American West</I>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_1/C39/L39" title="which we excerpted here last year">which we excerpted here last year</a>, will be published by Houghton Mifflin next month.

Each month the group will feature a different book and hold events in Borders stores in eight states, including New Mexico and Utah.&nbsp; The group has announced its selections for the rest of 2008, which will kick off in June with a focus on Christina Garcia&#8217;s <I>A Handbook to Luck</I>.

		<p>Great roundup today Jenny, thanks. Sad news about Gary Hunt. Humans can be so hard. The world they make bleak. Yet a good man lives amongst us and we are the better for it. Now, with his passing, we are diminshed. Yet, his goodness still flows river like through his family and friends and beyond. His story our story. He will be missed and we will carry forward the decency and dignity of his life.</p>

							Near the top of Coloradoâ€™s 13,223 foot-high Mt. Audubon this weekend, the wildlife was abundant.  Columbines bloomed in every shade from white to blue to pink to yellow, and electric blue alpine forget-me-nots and purple aster dotted the mountainside.  Whistle Pigs (also known as yellow-bellied marmots) scurried in and out of their burrows underneath boulders, bounding between hideouts, looking fat, sassy and in good shape for their coming hibernation.  Rocky Mountain pikas, whose gray fur perfectly matched the granite rocks in which they make their homes, chirped and chittered and darted in and out of dens, gathering grasses to dry for a winter food stockpile, and baby pikas the size of mice, born between May and July, ventured out for a look at the world.  But according to several studies, this alpine idyll will likely be disrupted in the coming years.<br />
<br />
In the <i>National Geographic</i> September 2004 issue on <a target="_blank" href="http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0409/feature1/" title="global warming">global warming</a>, the plight of the pika was featured in the article â€œNo Room To Run.â€?  The pika is a small lagomorph, a mammal related to rabbits and hares, not rodents.  In North America, the pika is found only in the Western mountain ranges, especially in the high talus slopes of the Rocky Mountains, where the cold weather suits them and the rock-strewn mountainside provides them innumerable crevices to serve as dens.  As global temperatures increase, the pikas must move higher or perish (some pika varieties live at altitudes as high as 19,000 feet), but as most of them already hang out at around 13,000 feet, there isnâ€™t much real estate left for their relocation.<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://ice.ucdavis.edu/pika/pikapage.html" title="The Pika Project">The Pika Project</a>, initiated in 1989 by UC Davis professor Michael Gilpin and his student Chris Ray, found that â€œmany of the pika metapopulations that once thrived on mountaintops in the Great Basin have gone extinct.â€? USGS scientist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-12/wwf-lcf121504.php" title="Erik Beever">Erik Beever</a> found that â€œpikas appear to have been lost from nearly one-third of the Great Basin locations at which they have been historically recorded.â€?  A 2003 study published in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bioone.org/pdfserv/i1545-1542-084-01-0037.pd" title="Journal of Mammalogy">Journal of Mammalogy</a> showed that â€œnine out of 25 populationsâ€? studied have disappeared.  And the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/pikas/index.cfm" title="World Wildlife Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> says that â€œthe American pika may be one of the first North American mammals to fall victim to global warming.â€?<br />
<br />
Pikas are charming, industrious creatures, and I donâ€™t want to think about a future in which I wonâ€™t hear them chirping away and see their soft fur stirring in the breeze during my summer hikes.  Found in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, the pika is an emblematic Western species, and was voted among the <a target="_blank" href="http://worldwildlife.org/cutest/" title=""cutest" North American animals">"cutest" North American animals</a> in a World Wildlife Fund survey.  If the Rocky Mountain region is looking for a baby-seal-like poster child to spur its inhabitants toward limiting fossil fuel consumption, the pika is an ideal candidate.

		<p>doesn't it always seem that it is easiest to ignore the smallest of animals at risk and to focus our money and attention (as a society) on the "megafauna" that are so engaging--grizzly bears, or they are a species that have some commerical/hunting value--salmon, elk. Does anyone remember the airplane and rivits story from high school? A course analogy, but perhaps applicable in this situation.</p>

Greenpeace Decides Northern Spotted Owl 'Not Worth the Trouble Anymore'<br />
<br />
AMSTERDAMâ€”Citing "organization-wide disinterest in a truly mundane species of bird," Greenpeace announced Monday that it is ending its decades-long fight to save the endangered Northern Spotted Owl. "For some reason, we devoted more than 30 years to trying to save this unspectacular little owl," Greenpeace associate director Tomas Lindstrom said. "But somewhere along the way, I guess we just came to our senses and kind of lost interest." Lindstrom said the environmental group plans to shift its focus to "saving animals that people actually see every once in a while." <br />
<br />
let's save the unspectacular little pika, or at least not keep it from saving itself.</p>

		<p>theres no info, this is a HORRBLE! site!<br />
<br />
you have to put stuff on more solutions to save pikas! <br />
<br />
your so lucky im writing to you now!<br />
put more info!</p>

		<p>Hi Kyla,<br />
<br />
I'm glad the pikas have such a passionate advocate as you.  The solutions to save pikas aren't simple, as their endangerment has been caused by global warming, but the World Wildlife Fund has set up a special Pika fund that you can donate to:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worldwildlife.org%2Fpikas%2F">http://www.worldwildlife.org/pikas/</a><br />
<br />
There is a lot of good info on pikas on this webpage of a UC Davis research team, too:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fice.ucdavis.edu%2Fpika%2Fpikapage.html">http://ice.ucdavis.edu/pika/pikapage.html</a><br />
<br />
Other than that, anything you can personally do to limit the creation of greenhouse gases--such as riding your bike instead of driving--will be the best way to help pikas.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sally, 10-10-05</b>
		<p>I disagree with the kyla's comment that this is a horrible site.  This site is not all about pikas, nor is it all about environmental issues.  I am actually impressed with this level of pika information on a general website about living in the 'west'. If you are looking for more information on pikas, the 2 sites Jenny recommended are great-- not to mention there are plenty of reputable journals like the Journal of Mammology that explore the plight of the pika.</p>

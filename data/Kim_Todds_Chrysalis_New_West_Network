<I>Chrysalis: Maria Sibylla Merian and the Secrets of Metamorphosis</I>, a nonfiction book by Missoula writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kimtodd.net/" title="Kim Todd">Kim Todd</a>, sounds like a Victorian adventure novel: a fifty-two-year-old woman abandons her husband and European continent to study the metamorphosis of caterpillars in Surinam.&nbsp; But this was before the Victorians.&nbsp; In 1699, more than a century before Darwin, sixty-five years after Galileo&#8217;s prosecution, and a time when witch hunts were part of the recent past, Maria Sibylla Merian embarked on a journey of scientific discovery in the dangerous New World with only her daughter for company.&nbsp; While the male colonists grew sugar cane on their plantations, Merian&#8217;s slaves and servants helped her locate insects, reptiles, and plants for her to study and depict in her captivating watercolors.&nbsp; She trusted the natives&#8217; knowledge to assist her research, something that would be used against her reputation in the decades after her death.
</p>
<p>
By the time Merian stepped on that boat to Surinam, she was a mother of two, had published two books about the metamorphosis of caterpillars in her native Germany, and spent five years living with a Pietist religious sect in a castle in Amsterdam, where she argued successfully for a separation from her husband using the sect&#8217;s beliefs.&nbsp; At the time, a woman&#8217;s husband was her legal representative and the court ordered numerous women to return to their abusive husbands.&nbsp; But after Merian&#8217;s successful separation, she lived in Amsterdam and financially supported herself and her youngest daughter.&nbsp; Watercolors were her tool because &#8220;guild rules banned women from painting with oils.&#8221;  To get on that boat and to fund her scientific and artistic expedition, Merian sold her paintings and any unnecessary belongings.
</p>
<p>
Kim Todd who received the PEN/Jerard Fund Award and the Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing for her previous book, <I>Tinkering with Eden</I>, vividly describes the cultural, religious, and political time Merian lived in, as well as her artwork and scientific contributions, without overwhelming the reader.&nbsp; Todd also introduces other fascinating, accomplished women of the seventeenth century, and the new, exciting time of natural philosophers (the term scientist hadn&#8217;t been created yet, neither had biology, ecology, or any of the other &#8211;ologies).&nbsp; Spontaneous generation, the idea that creatures could be born from non-living sources, was a common belief during Merian&#8217;s time.&nbsp; Todd includes some of the recipes.&nbsp; My favorite is:
</p>
<blockquote><p>To get a bee &#8211;
<br />
Find a sunny space roofed with tile
<br />
Beat a three year old bull to death
<br />
Put poplar and willow branches under the body 
<br />
Cover it with thyme and serpellium
<br />
The bees will emerge
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In language as colorful as Merian&#8217;s paintings, Todd also describes the intricacies of metamorphosis and some of the insects that befuddled Merian and other natural philosophers.&nbsp; Through Todd&#8217;s gripping prose, I became excited about the tricky metamorphosis of the large blue butterfly (<I>Maculinea arion</I>).&nbsp; Trust me, that&#8217;s an accomplishment.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t believe insects and metamorphosis are interesting, you will feel differently after this book.&nbsp; To experience Merian&#8217;s life and what happened to her work and reputation after her death, you will need, and want, to read <I>Chrysalis</I>.&nbsp; One hint: Peter the Great is involved.

		<p>Wikipedia has a profile of Maria Sibylla Merian that puts a different slant on her history. Still, she was a remarkable person.<br />

		<b>Comment By Susan T, 10-09-07</b>
		<p>An excellent review that provides interested readers with enough detail to get a clear picture of what the book entails without giving away any of the secrets. In fact it leaves one with suspence, wondering how Peter the Great is involved!</p>

		<p>Thanks for the interesting review.  I"m always interested in tales of women who reinvented themselves mid-life, particularly single mothers who managed to thrive.</p>

							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonspongecake.com" title="Lemon Sponge Cake Contemporary Ballet">Lemon Sponge Cake Contemporary Ballet</a> has made its home in Boulder since 1999.  Founded by dancer and choreographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemonspongecake.com/bio.html" title="Robert Sher-Machherndl">Robert Sher-Machherndl</a> and his wife Jenifer Sher, who serves as the Executive Director and costume designer, the small company has been attracting attention from prominent members of the dance world. Recently, New Choreographers On Point Inc. selected Sher-Machherndl to present a dance in this year's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.balletbuilders.org/" title="BalletBuilders">BalletBuilders</a> showcase for the second consecutive year. Sher-Machherndl and Tessa Victoria will perform <i>Where Is The Love</i> this weekend in New York City at the French Institute/Alliance Fran√ßaise.  I recently asked Jenifer Sher a few questions about the award and Lemon Sponge Cake.<br />
<br />
<b>What does this award recognize?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b> BalletBuilders presents the works of talented emerging and established choreographers to audiences in New York City. They are selected in auditions before distinguished ballet professionals. <br />
<br />
<b>What was the application process for the award?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b> Open auditions are held in New York City every autumn. Choreographers wishing to participate in BalletBuilders audition before a panel of distinguished members of the dance community: choreographers, artistic directors and teachers. The panel evaluates one work, selected by the choreographer, presented either in live performance or on videotape. <br />
<br />
<b>Who will be in attendance at the performance?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b> Choreographers who participate in Ballet Builders gain exposure to an audience of ballet professionals, the artistic staff of ballet companies, critics, representatives of foundations and government funders, and a public that is knowledgeable about, investigates and supports the art of dance.<br />
<br />
<b>What has the award meant for past winners?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b>  Exposure to the New York dance community and reviews in the major New York dance press can be extremely important in opening up career opportunities for emerging ballet choreographers. Participation in Ballet Builders has led to commissions for new works, fellowships and funding, attention by the press, and the opportunity to have programs of their works produced.<br />
<br />
<b>Why did Lemon Sponge Cake choose to set up in Boulder?  Are audiences here supportive?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b>  Audiences are very supportive of Robert's work and have a loyal and growing following.  The company has received critical acclaim from national publications.  This is the second consecutive appearance at the<br />
BalletBuilders showcase.  <i>The New York Times</i> calls Robert "a choreographer to watch for."<br />
<br />
<b>Are there advantages to being so far away from the major centers of dance<br />
in this country?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b>  The advantage for Robert has been to develop an individual style of movement. Being in this part of the country has created much intrigue in New York, the world's dance capitol, about the type of new work he is creating.  At this point we have dancers from all over the country contacting us to dance with LSCCB. <br />
<br />
<b>What are the future goals for the company?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b>  The company plans on touring nationally and internationally.<br />
<br />
<b>Does Lemon Sponge Cake have any local shows planned?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Jenifer Sher:</b>  The next performance is the world premiere of <i>Mozart 250</i> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chautauqua.com/" title="Chautauqua Auditorium">Chautauqua Auditorium</a> in Boulder on August 19 and 20.  <br />

		<p>Jenifer and Robert's Lemon Sponge Cake Ballet company is surely one of the biggest and brightest among Boulder's (and the New West's) crown jewels. We're lucky to have them in our midst. If you haven't seen them yet, check 'em out--Lemon Spong Cake makes for the most romantic, enlightening evening out this side of la Seine.<br />

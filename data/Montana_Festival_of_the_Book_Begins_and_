Finally, I&#8217;ve previously mentioned the entertaining blog of the Boulder Book Store&#8217;s head buyer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/boulder_book_stores_buyer_blogs_columnist_arouses_ire_and_vegas_gets_the_li/C39/L39/" title="Arsen Kashkashian">Arsen Kashkashian</a>, and wanted to point out his informative <a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/" title="post from last week">post from last week</a>.&nbsp; The Boulder Book Store recently celebrated its 35th anniversary, and as a part of that brought several bestselling writers to town. Kashkashian analyzes three of those recent events, and discusses what went wrong and what went right.&nbsp; The Neil Gaiman reading hosted at the Unity Church was a huge hit, selling out the 600-seat venue (with $6 tickets), and the Book Store sold 285 copies of the book Gaiman was promoting, as well as &#8220;dozens of backlist books.&#8221; Kashkashian reports that a live screening of a Phillip Roth interview was a bust, however, as was a Philippa Gregory reading that they had to cancel due to lack of ticket sales.

		<p>Wildlands CPR, a local conservation non-profit, will have a table at Festival of the Book to promote our Collector's Edition book, "A Road Runs Through It: Reviving Wild Places". With a Foreword by Annie Proulx (The Shipping News, Brokeback Mountain), this passionate collection of essays features writing by Peter Matthiessen (currently nominated for a National Book Award), Barry Lopez, Janisse Ray, Edward Abbey and dozens of others. Together, they explore how roads and off-road vehicles have impacted wildlands, while also offering a restoration vision for these lands.<br />
<br />
Our Limited Edition Set consists of a leather-bound book signed by all 26 living authors including Annie Proulx, Peter Matthiessen and Barry Lopez. The book is accompanied by six woodcut prints by Montana artist Claire Emery in a matching leather clamshell box. We have 47 sets left for purchase.<br />
<br />
Wildlands CPR will be auctioning off one of these sets at their release party and raffle November 7, 2008 at Zootown Brew, 121 W. Broadway St. at 7:30pm.<br />
<br />
Attendees can purchase a raffle ticket for $50 now online, and at Festival of the Book. Attendance not required to win, only 250 tickets available.<br />
Thanks!</p>

							Witold Rybczynski, architecture critic for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/" title="Slate">Slate</a>, recently visited the Golden Triangle area in Denver and gave his two cents in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2145439/" title="a photo essay ">a photo essay </a> about the three prominent buildings in the area: the Michael Graves Denver Public Library, the Geo Ponti Denver Art Museum, and the Daniel Libeskind addition to the art museum.  In an article creatively titled "The Mile-High Club: Why experimental architecture isn't working out for Denver," Rybczynski tells readers exactly why this grouping of buildings makes an "interesting failure."  (Out-of-state journalists, no matter how erudite, just can't seem to give the Mile-High Club chestnut a rest when writing about Denver.  We Denverites didn't laugh at that joke the last eight hundred times, either.)<br />
<br />
His conclusion: "Ponti's iconoclastic design appears a little tired; some of the tiles have fallen off, and the sculpted top looks kitschy. Graves' colorful neoclassicism lacks gravitas; we don't know whether to be impressed or to smile. While it's too early yet to assess Libeskind's design, one wonders how it will look in 30 years. Will it still startle, as it does today, or will it merely make us sigh? Shock is delightful in an amusement park, but in a building it can only, in the long-run, prove an anticlimax."<br />
<br />
But it doesn't appear that Rybczynski actually went inside and used the buildings--he merely assesed how they looked from the outside.  This is the kind of architectural criticism that results in buildings that are beautiful but dysfunctional, such as the curvy Frank Lloyd Wright Guggenheim in New York and the I.M. Pei NCAR Mesa Lab in Boulder, which fits in wonderfully with the natural surroundings outside, but inside many of the offices have the feel of dark, windowless bomb shelters.<br />
<br />
The Liebskind building isn't open yet, but if Rybczynski had actually ventured into the Graves library, he'd have seen an uplifting example of bustling public library whose design is inviting and inspiring.  I used to live in a Capitol Hill apartment that turned so stifling in the summer that it reminded me of that metal shed that Alex Guinness was tortured in during "Bridge on the River Kwai."   So I'd walk down to the Graves library and spend the day in the air-conditioned comfort and pleasant surroundings.  <br />
<br />
All around the central atrium on several floors is an array of inviting study desks, each with a Graves-designed lamp.  The room that housed the magazines and periodicals has a huge picture window with a spectacular view, and plenty of comfortable areas for research.  The Western History department is a marvel--you feel that all the stories of the past are at your disposal there as you wander from looking at old maps of Denver to requesting newspaper clipping files on different historical topics.  (Clipping files: How quaint in this age of Google, yet how satisfyingly tactile for research.)  The children's section is appropriately whimsical.  The colors inside the building are bright enough to be remarkable compared the beiges and grays of typical government buildings, but not so bright as to be distracting.  <br />
<br />
This library is the most conducive to research, study, reading, and just hanging out as any I've ever been in, and the only other library that I've found as inspiring to work in is the Library of Congress, where I once spent a semester as a research assistant.  But whereas the Library of Congress' public room suggests august grandeur, the Graves library is populist and warm throughout.  You, too, can be a writer, reader, and scholar, it seems to say.  So what if it "lacks gravitas."  Apart from occassional harrassment by a homeless person (and well, that's populism for you), the Graves Denver Public Library is one of the most pleasant public spaces I've ever spent time in.<br />
<br />
So pick on the grouping of the three buildings in the Golden Triangle if you must, but it seems only fair to wait and see how the Libeskind addition functions as an art museum before we judge it.  Architecture critics from east-of-the-Mississippi publications are welcome to fly in for a day and assess the overall look of Denver's buildings, but the best judges will always be those who actually use the buildings.

		<p>I want to attend the August 30 presentation from 5:30 - 7:30pm by Daniel Liebskind at the Denver Convention Center of his Denver Civic Center design.<br />
<br />
Can I just walk in?  Where is it?  How can I register to attend with a friend?</p>

		<p>Hmmm... I click on visual arts and I get comedy/spoken word review. There's something lacking in this web site's basic understanding of genres and art.</p>

		<h1>Climate Researchers Hurl Insults at Boulder Conference</h1>

							Northern Colorado is a hotbed of weather research institutes, with NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research) and the Colorado State and University of Colorado meteorology departments.  With so many minds focused on weather in such close proximity, there are bound to be some turf battles, and yet it's relatively unusual for scientists to butt heads as publicly as a couple of them did at the 31st annual Climate Diagnostics & Prediction Workshop in Boulder yesterday.  According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5094006,00.html" title="an article ">an article </a>in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> yesterday, two scientists disparaged each other in interviews with reporter Jim Erikson.  The battle went like this:<br />
<br />
"Colorado State University's William Gray, one of the nation's preeminent hurricane forecasters, called noted Boulder climate researcher Kevin Trenberth an opportunist and a Svengali who 'sold his soul to the devil to get (global warming) research funding.'<br />
<br />
Trenberth countered that Gray is not a credible scientist.<br />
<br />
'Not any more. He was at one time, but he's not any more,' Trenberth said of Gray, one of a handful of prominent U.S. scientists who question whether humans play a significant role in warming the planet by burning fossil fuels that release heat-trapping gases."<br />
<br />
'He's one of the contrarians, some of whom get money to spread lies about global warming,' Trenberth said."<br />
<br />
At issue is whether or not hurricanes have been intensifying in recent years, and if so, whether global warming is to blame.  Perhaps only time--or a look at Beelzebub's sales receipts--will tell.<br />

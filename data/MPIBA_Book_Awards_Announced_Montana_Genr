I have only read one of the above books&#8212;Rinella&#8217;s <I>American Buffalo</I>, which I thoroughly enjoyed and felt certain would win some prizes because it was so entertaining and distinctive.&nbsp; Plus, who doesn&#8217;t like buffaloes?
</p>
<p>
The selection that interests me the most is the Adult Fiction winner, Craig Johnson&#8217;s <I>Another Man&#8217;s Moccasins</I>.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry to say I haven&#8217;t yet read anything by Johnson, and it&#8217;s interesting to note that this is the first time since the MPIBA started giving these awards in 1991 that this category has been won by a genre novel rather than a work of literary fiction.&nbsp; Some of the best contemporary books with Western settings have won this award&#8212;including Kent Haruf&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I>, Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s <I>All The Pretty Horses</I>, Larry Watson&#8217;s <I>Montana 1948</I>, Rick Bass&#8217;s <I>The Sky, the Stars, the Wilderness</I>&#8212;so I&#8217;m sure that Johnson&#8217;s work must rise above regular mystery genre conventions.&nbsp; Clearly I&#8217;ve been missing out.&nbsp; If there are any Craig Johnson fans out there, leave a comment and let me know what captured your attention in his books.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Johnson wrote a classy thank you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mountainsplains.org/Blog/post/Regional-Book-Award-Winner-2009-Craig-Johnson.aspx" title="on the MPIBA blog">on the MPIBA blog</a>, which begins, &#8220;All right, there are a few awards I figured I&#8217;d never get, and I got both of them this year&#8212;one was the Western Writer&#8217;s of America Spur Award and the other is the Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Bookseller&#8217;s Association (Regional Book Award - Fiction) Novel of the Year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Speaking of genre vs. literary novels, a while back <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/genre_writers_flourish_in_colorado_while_literary_types_type_in_montana/C39/L39/" title="I pondered why it seemed like there were more genre novels set in Colorado, and more literary novels set in Montana">I pondered why it seemed like there were more genre novels set in Colorado, and more literary novels set in Montana</a>.&nbsp; But lately a number of genre novels with Montana settings have come to my attention: 
</p>
<p>
The current <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13129743?IADID=Search-www.dailycamera.com-www.dailycamera.com" title="literary craze for all things zombie and vampire ">literary craze for all things zombie and vampire </a>has a counterpart in Montana: the werewolf novels of Butte native <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.patriciabriggs.com " title="Patricia Briggs">Patricia Briggs</a>.&nbsp; Briggs keeps busy writing several series of fantasy novels; her Alpha and Omega series is all about werewolves.&nbsp; The most recent is <I>Hunting Ground</I> (Ace, 304 pages, $7.99), which hit stores last week.&nbsp; A reviewer known as &#8220;Janine&#8221; of the romance novel review blog <a target="_blank" href="http://dearauthor.com/wordpress/2009/08/24/review-hunting-ground-by-patricia-briggs/" title="Dear Author,&#8230;">Dear Author,&#8230;</a>offered one of the first reviews, and she included a good summary of the werewolf duo at the center of the series, the Montana-based Charles, and his lady&#8212;er&#8212;dog love Anna:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Charles is an over two hundred year old, half Native American werewolf. He is dominant enough to be an alpha, but his pack has one werewolf who is even more dominant &#8212; Bran, Charles&#8217; father, an alpha of alphas, also known as the Marrok, or leader of all of North America&#8217;s werewolves&#8230;Anna, Charles&#8217; mate, is an omega werewolf, which means that she is outside the pack structure. She cannot be commanded by anyone, but she also lacks the alphas&#8217; aggressive tendencies. Instead, her presence has a calming influence on dominant wolves. Anna is a relatively young werewolf, only in her twenties. The pack Anna originally belonged to abused her and assaulted her sexually, and Anna&#8217;s recovery from those attacks is an ongoing process.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile, in the same state, but over in thriller land, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lisajackson.com" title="Lisa Jackson">Lisa Jackson</a> sets her new series featuring two female cops in the Montana wilderness near the fictional town of Grizzly Falls.&nbsp; Jackson recently described her series, including her new book, <I>Chosen To Die</I> (Zebra, 484 pages, $7.99), in an interview with the blog <a target="_blank" href="http://cherylsbooknook.blogspot.com/2009/08/if-you-love-them-let-them-go.html" title="Cheryl's Book Nook">Cheryl&#8217;s Book Nook</a>.&nbsp; Jackson said her editor suggested writing a book with two female cops, and initially she rejected the idea:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But, as is often the case, the idea grew on me and I saw not cops in the city, but two detectives in the raw Montana wilderness. Those detectives grew in my mind. the first was Regan Pescoli, a hard-as-nails single mother, who has trouble with her ex-husband, teenaged kids, and hot lover. Regan just can&#8217;t seem to be all places at once. Then there is her partner, Selena Alvarez, a transplant from Woodburn, Oregon who is wound tight as a bobbin in my mother&#8217;s old Singer sewing machine and has a lot of dark secrets of her own.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of emails about self-published books, which I don&#8217;t have time to cover for the most part, but heck, since it goes with the theme of this week&#8217;s Roundup, I&#8217;ll mention Eve Nielsen&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.booksurge.com/Operation-Eden/A/1439234620.htm" title="Operation Eden">Operation Eden</a></I> (BookSurge, 476 pages, $19.99).&nbsp; Nielsen, who grew up in Libby, Mont., and currently lives in Washington state, says that some of the book takes place in the Cabinet Mountains.&nbsp; She spoke with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thewesternnews.com/articles/2009/08/03/news/doc4a71edadbf65e140458148.txt" title="The Western News">The Western News</a> about her writing process, and sent me a description of the book in an email:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The basic premise is that an extremely wealthy and powerful group initiate a series of secret genetic experiments using randomly selected civilians, bypassing normal scientific protocol. The unwitting civilians are inoculated with specific-trait genes designed to enhance physical and mental characteristics, including ESP and longevity.&nbsp; The purpose of this attempt by members of the group would be to enhance their own abilities as well as to offer the genetic cocktail for profit, once the results are achieved.&nbsp; But some of their subjects discover what is happening and take steps to protect themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So, in the world of books at least, lots of strange, paranormal, violent things are going on up there in Montana.&nbsp; Which doesn&#8217;t surprise me in the least.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t let the werewolves bite, friends.

		<b>Comment By Tom Page, 9-02-09</b>
		<p>The appeal of Johnson's books is difficult to pinpoint, but one thing worth keeping in mind when you read his Walt Longmire series is that it seems more in keeping with Jack Schaefer, Dorothy Johnson (no relation...I asked.) or Vardis Fisher than it does with writers such as Annie Proulx or Tom McGuane.  <br />
<br />
I haven't read his most recent book, but the first three have a level of consistency that is unusual in crime series.  There are several of the standard crime novel elements (wounded detective, snappy sidekick, to name just two...) but it doesn't come off as hokey, at least to me.  Although, one of my bookseller friends who reads a lot read The Cold Dish after I recommended it, and she thought it quite silly. <br />
<br />
Mr. Johnson is also a gracious and pleasant signer - last year he sent me back my books within the week.<br />
<br />
And, since you linked to your Colorado genre fiction article, I'll suggest that you read Dan Simmons' (Longmont, CO) book Hyperion, if you should ever feel compelled to pick up a great SF book by a westerner.  I love Connie Willis' books, but only Doomsday rises to the level of Hyperion.  Something of a strange coincidence that two of the best in the game live in northern Colorado.  There are crime writers in MT, too - what about Mr. Crumley?<br />
<br />
PS - Did you get a chance to come up here for the Sun Valley Writer's Conference last week?  I'm a bit surprised that it never showed up here.  It's not everyday that Ian McEwan comes to town.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 9-02-09</b>
		<p>Thanks for all those insights, Tom.  Although I usually read literary fiction, of all the different genres, crime fiction is my favorite (I love Richard Price, for example), so I'm going to check out Craig Johnson's work soon.<br />
<br />
And sorry there were no reports from the Sun Valley Writer's Conference--I don't travel as much as I used to as I have two little kids.  Next year hopefully I can find somebody to write some posts about it.</p>

Tom Page hit the nail on the head. I would add that I love his dialog, sense of humor, and humanity. I was a bit of a literary fiction snob until I read Johnson's Longmire series. Now, I'm hooked. I've recommended him to a wide range of folks and, so far, they've all loved him. <br />

		<b>Comment By Richard Wheeler, 9-21-09</b>
		<p>Dear Ms Shank,<br />
<br />
I've been trying for years to find out how literary fiction differs from genre or popular fiction. Could you enlighten me? I'm looking for an authoritative, complete definition or set of criteria.<br />
<br />
Cordially,<br />
<br />
Richard Wheeler</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 9-21-09</b>
		<p>Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
That is a good question, because of course some fiction labeled "literary" has qualities of certain genre fiction, such as a mystery or romance element.  But this Wikipedia entry does a pretty good job of explanation:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FGenre_fiction">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre_fiction</a><br />
<br />
I especially think this part of the article is apt: "All fiction is essentially generic. But genre fiction is overtly and intentionally so, signaling its generic identity in the clearest possible terms. A horror novel, for example, makes it clear through its cover design, its blurb, the comments printed on the cover from other novelists, and so on, that it is a horror novel; and it will be shelved in the appropriate place in bookstores."<br />
<br />
Look at the book jacket on "Hunting Ground" above, which seems to me a classic horror or sci-fi type jacket.  The font and drawing signal to the reader that if they've liked this sort of thing before, they'll probably like this book.<br />
<br />
Another interesting note, however--a book that may be labeled as a certain genre by U.S. publishers and booksellers may be given another category in another country.  I think Craig Johnson is marketed as a mystery writer here, and more of a literary writer in France, for example.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</p>

		<p>Dear Ms shank,<br />
<br />
Thanks for steering me to Wiki. I found this passage quite telling:<br />
<br />
Literary fiction<br />
<br />
Literary fiction is a term in common usage since around 1970 to distinguish so-called "serious" fiction (that is, work with claims to literary merit) from other types of genre fiction. In broad terms, literary fiction focuses more on style, psychological depth, and character, whereas mainstream commercial fiction (the "page-turner") focuses more on narrative and plot.<br />
<br />
[edit] <br />
<br />
I grew up in the 40s, and recollect that there were no distinctions made in those days. It was all literature. Pulitzer Prizes were awarded to all sorts of novels that now would be classified as popular fiction, including Gone With the Wind, The Caine Mutiny, and Advise and Consent. A friend with a background in criticism from Columbia University said the change began about 1970, when academics began sorting serious fiction from "lighter" fiction, and Wiki seems to confirm that.</p>

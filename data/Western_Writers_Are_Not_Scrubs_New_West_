							<p>A few weeks ago, I was chatting with another mother at the Parenting Place in Boulder.&nbsp; I mentioned that I wrote book reviews, and she asked if I could read anything I wanted.&nbsp; I said that for some newspapers I was assigned books, and for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/books" title="NewWest.Net/Books">NewWest.Net/Books</a>, I got to choose anything I liked that was written about the West or by a Western writer.
</p>
<p>
She wrinkled her nose.&nbsp; &#8220;That must be hard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I wonder how many people who live in this region--especially those who have moved here from elsewhere--still think that culture must be imported from other parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>
This woman was an avid reader with good taste.&nbsp; She mentioned Richard Russo, Sue Miller, and Anne Tyler as being some of her favorite authors, who live in Maine, Boston, and Baltimore, respectively.&nbsp; I love those writers, too--I just raved about Russo&#8217;s <i>Bridge of Sighs</i> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/oct/05/recalling-glory-days/" title="for the Rocky Mountain News">for the Rocky Mountain News</a>.&nbsp; But a Colorado girl cannot live on East coast fiction alone, and it made me a little frustrated that a reader who lives here wouldn&#8217;t dream of picking up a book by a local author.
</p>
<p>
I didn&#8217;t get into it with her--I think one of her children started to howl and our conversation ended.&nbsp; But I&#8217;d like to say for the record that it&#8217;s not at all difficult to find good books that are written by regional writers.&nbsp; In fact, I have stacks of promising books published this year that people have sent me, more than I can possibly get to.&nbsp; I started editing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/books" title="NewWest.Net/Books">NewWest.Net/Books</a> in April, and I wondered if I&#8217;d be able to fill the page every week.&nbsp; But since I&#8217;ve focused on it, I&#8217;ve found a treasure trove of Western books, from major publishers and small presses alike. 
</p>
<p>
I might have been guilty of skipping the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_7409873?source=rss" title="Regional Fiction">Regional Fiction</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_7344624" title="Nonfiction">Nonfiction</a> column in the Denver Post before I started this gig.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s only because the tag &#8220;regional&#8221; seems to diminish the writing.&nbsp; A lot of the books I&#8217;ve read by Western authors this year have been world-class.
</p>
<p>
The apparently persistent idea that culture must be imported from elsewhere puts me in mind of Willa Cather&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/song_of_the_lark.html" title="The Song of the Lark">The Song of the Lark</a>, in which a young singer has to leave Colorado in order to fulfill her artistic dreams.&nbsp; This may have been true during Western settlement--the book was set in the early 1900s--but it&#8217;s just not anymore.&nbsp; Well, maybe it&#8217;s still true for opera singers.&nbsp; But not for books.&nbsp; So here&#8217;s my message to newcomers: if you really want to settle in here, folks, open your eyes.&nbsp; Read a book by an author who lives in the same state that you do.
</p>
<p>

		<b>Comment By Heather Sharfeddin, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>Excellent point, Jenny. And one that is near and dear to me. As an author of western fiction, I often get snubbed by bookstores and reviewers because I've called my work Contemporary Western. I blame it on too many B cowboy movies from the 70s. They've created a stereotype that has eclipsed the important contribution stories about the modern, rural west tell. How about these western authors: Craig Leslie, Claire Davis, Kim Barnes, Sherman Alexie, David Fromm, Larry Watson, Judy Blunt, Rick Bass... oh, and let's not forget Cormac McCarthy. Just to name a few.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Miller, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>Good point, but then there’s the confusion of whether something’s western literature or literature by a westerner. Some of the best works about the West, fiction and non-fiction, have been written by Easterners. Is David Quammen a western writer because he lives in Montana, or an international writer because his works draw on different continents? Ascribing geography to literature can be dangerous, still, often it’s a danger worth indulging in. <br />
Your move, pawn to K-4.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>Hi Tom,<br />
<br />
I agree that good writing about a place can be written by a writer who doesn't live there, and also that writers shouldn't to be confined to only writing about the geography in which they live.  <br />
<br />
I just don't agree with the attitude that I see sometimes that a book can't be good if it's local.  (It's funny that so many people can consider the West good enough to live in, but still culturally backward.) So I guess my argument is in favor giving a chance to "literature by a westerner" and also not to overlook things that are labeled "regional" literature.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By matguy, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>On the proliferation of the idea that a book "just can't be good if it's local:"<br />
<br />
It would help greatly if every local product (including some books) didn't get propped up on a pedestal just for its "localness."  I'm just tired of professing a love for some non-western food/writer/idea/product/activity and having some earnest Missoulian respond that "oh, but ____ is from Montana/you can ____ in Montana/  and it is just as good or better..."  It's not that I haven't given local stuff a chance, I have, and some of it is just as good or better than what comes from a broader pool.  <br />
<br />
But with local stuff, like most stuff from anywhere, some of it is good and most of it isn't.  I don't really have time to read a lot of junk, so sometimes it's easier to grab something that comes internationally recommended than it is to sort through yet another collection of poems or stories about fishing and horses, looking for a nugget somewhere.    <br />
<br />
So, perhaps some of that "can't be good if it's local" attitude is backlash from people like me.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>Who's a writer from the West and who's not? It's a fun way to while away a snowy Wyoming afternoon. Rick Bass isn't from Montana but he's written some of the best fiction and non-fiction about it. The stories in his first collection are all set in his old stomping grounds of Mississippi and Texas. If you're classifying writers by regions, he can be a Southern writer too. Southerner Richard Ford wrote a fine story collection called "Rock Springs" with many stories set in Montana and Wyoming. I'm fond of his novel, "The Sportswriter," set mostly in New Jersey. Annie Proulx says that all of her novels, including "The Shipping News" set in Newfoundland, were written in Wyoming. The stories in her two collections are all set in Wyoming. Does that make her a Western writer? I think it does, but some Wyo. natives vehemently disagree because she's from the dreaded East Coast. <br />
<br />
My favorite anecdote on this subject comes by way of Jackson's Tim Sandlin, another transplant from a non-West state. In an essay he wrote for the 2003 anthology I co-edited, "Deep West: A Literary Tour of Wyoming" (shameless plug), he recalled a Montana woman who asked William Faulkner why his fiction was so much better than the writers in her home state. She claimed that Montana writers loved Montana as much as Faulkner loved Mississippi, therefore the fiction should be just as powerful as his. Faulkner's answer: "Madame, I hate Mississippi."<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's hatred, or at least a jaundiced view of our home place, that makes for the best writing.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Miller, 11-21-07</b>
		<p>As for regional identity, nothing plagues a Latin American author more than the weighty boom generation “magical realism” label foisted on practically everyone whose last name ends in a vowel or a z. To counter this, a few years ago a group of ultra-talented young Mexican writers issued “The Crack Manifesto,” which was, essentially, a calculated break with the “magical realism” identity. Instead, it projected complexity in plot, style, and geography. Why can’t a Mexican set his or her novel in Scotland? Or a Brazilian in the Ukraine? This literary independence takes form in Revuelta, a terrific literary magazine from Puebla, Mex.; it’s a publication with a very international perspective and a wide cast of contributors. (The name: Octavio Paz and his disciples had a magazine Vuelta. This is Revuelta; get it?)<br />
<br />
All of which is to broaden the discussion about regional identity and literature. Back home, poor Ed Abbey was categorized a “Southwest writer,” a condescending but ultimately benign label that plagues those writing about the turf west of Louisiana and east of Los Angeles. He constantly groused that east coast editors didn’t understand his westerly writing, and used this to explain why he was never especially well received there. But he digressed.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Kirk Giloth, 11-23-07</b>
		<p>The question of regional identity in writing is unimportant to me as long as long as the writing is good and true. Jim Harrison lives in Paradise Valley, MT, winters in Patagonia, AZ and writes about his beloved upper peninsula of Michigan. Ivan Doig lives in Shoreline, WA an writes eloquently about his Two medicine country in Montana. Are they both Western writers? Or local writers?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By ethan miller, 11-24-07</b>
		<p>This is an old story. William Carlos Williams struggled to defend nativist American literature when Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Pound, and the rest were running around Europe. The truth is, there is some truth to it. Could Norman MacLean have written A River Runs Through It had he not spent 30 years as an academic in Chicago? Could AB Guthrie have written his novels if he hadn't spent 30 years in Kentucky working for a newspaper? Experiences in other places deepen our perspective of our home, perhaps even provide us with a national mood within which to compose an elegy to it. Westerners are notoriously insecure, because let's face it, the economic, political, and artistic centers of the country exist elsewhere. This makes it very difficult (though not impossible) to capture anything Western within a compelling national mood. Ironically, this is also why people love the West: it is "free" of the national mood.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bob Cherry, 12-20-07</b>
		<p>Ah yes, and lest we forget, Larry McMurtry [Pulitzer Prize winner] was once panned as "...a minor regional novelist..."<br />
<br />
He had that printed on a sweatshirt and wore it for several years to major literary functions and later became president of PEN International.  <br />
<br />
Cormac McCarthy, transplant to Texas and now New Mexico, is arguably our finest living writer, North, East, South OR West!  I believe he's written a book or two set in the West?</p>

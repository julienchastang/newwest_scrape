					<h4>A Thanksgiving Tradition</h4>

							A key part of Thanksgiving in Colorado is going to be missing this year: the annual excitement surrounding the CU vs. Nebraska football game.  Over the years, the Big 8 Championship was often on the line as these rivals squared off to end the regular season.  But with CU's record standing at 2-8, and Nebraska with a lock already on the Big 12 North title, there will be little at stake when the Buffs take the field in Lincoln Friday.  Growing up in Colorado with Nebraska transplant parents, the game was always the centerpiece of our Thanksgiving holiday--perhaps even more so than the turkey.<br />
<br />
When I was a kid, my dad was involved in an organization called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradans4nu.com/" title="Coloradans for Nebraska">Coloradans for Nebraska</a>, a group that caters to the football-watching needs of transplanted Nebraskans.  He even served as the president of this group one year.  During the '80s and early '90s, Coloradans for Nebraska always threw a blow-out pep rally the week of the game at the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_Hotel" title="Regency Hotel">Regency Hotel</a> in Denver--that's right, the infamous hotel with the golden dome you can see from I-25, that devolved into a drug den before its recent rehab into housing for students from Auraria Campus.<br />
<br />
The Nebraska band, mascot, and cheerleaders would make an appearance at the pep rally, as would a song-and-dance group called Scarlet and Cream, and everyone would gorge themselves on Valentino's pizza flown in from Nebraska.  My social life was limited in high school, so I convinced one of my friends to attend with me one year as a lark.  That was the year a blizzard prevented the entertainment from arriving, so instead of milling about with all the elderly Nebraskans eating pizza, my friend and I took a jar of cherries from the bar and practiced tying knots in the stems with our tongues.  When that grew old, we went to the pay phones in the lobby and tried to dial random 1-800 numbers to see who would answer.<br />
<br />
As for the game itself, I've attended many of them over the years, both in Boulder and Lincoln.  My loyalties were hopelessly divided, so I usually rooted for whichever team went into the game as the underdog.  My family would usually spend Thanksgiving in whatever state hosted the game that year.  The game is in Nebraska this year, but we're staying put, eating our bird at home.  With as dismal a season as CU's had, the thrill is gone, baby.  But wait 'till next year, right?<br />

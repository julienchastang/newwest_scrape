		<h1>Matson Jones Menaces with Cellos</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>

							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.matsonjones.net" title="Matson Jones">Matson Jones</a> is an intense young Ft. Collins quartet that makes the most of an instrument not normally associated with rock music: The cello. Although the band initially self-released its eponymous debut last year, it quickly excited a good deal of label attention based on its quirky, compelling live shows, earned a coveted invitation to perform at South By Southwest this year, and ultimately inked a deal with the indie Sympathy for the Record Industryâ€”the White Stripesâ€™ old labelâ€”who re-mastered and re-released the album nationally this month.<br />
<br />
Frontwomen Martina Grbac and Anna Mascorella share Matson Jonesâ€™ cello bowing and vocal duties, and judging from the songs on <i>Matson Jones</i>, they also share a dark bent. Their insistent, herky-jerky cello melodies, coupled with cryptic lyrics, crashing cymbals and the deep throbs of an upright bass create a predominant mood of menace that sometimes turns on sexual challenge, particularly in â€œN.E.S.F.T.O.,â€? where they insist: â€œThese knees wonâ€™t bend for anyone/I said these knees wonâ€™t spread for just anyoneâ€¦Daddy lock your girls upâ€¦Mama lock your boys up.â€?<br />
<br />
At times Mascorellaâ€™s pouting vocals progress to full-on hollering, as in â€œA Little Bit Of Arson Never Hurt Anyone,â€? and both on stage and in the recording studio, she sings into a Green Bullet microphone, originally intended for the use of harmonica players, so as to produce a distorted vibrato.  Thereâ€™s something about Mascorellaâ€™s singing that suggests mental fragility, making her arch, increasingly desperate question in â€œSympathyâ€?â€” â€œWhat have you done to the one I love?â€?â€”seem a fitting set-up for a scenario of gothic horror.<br />
<br />
Indeed, it is Matson Jonesâ€™ capacity to evoke fully-fleshed scenes in the listenerâ€™s head that suggests that this is a band that has the potential to endure.  They achieve this cinematic quality by defining a precise mood with their music and pairing it with lyric omission.  In â€œHe Means Nothing Dear,â€? when Mascorella moans â€œI donâ€™t think that heâ€™s murdered me dead yet/ so please, oh please keep him thinking fondly of me,â€? you canâ€™t help but wonder what the whole story behind this doomed love is, but itâ€™s up to the listener to fill in the blanks with dark woods, starless nights, a haunted Victorian house, or a rundown shack in the middle of a fetid swamp.<br />
<br />
<i>Matson Jones plays at the Westword Music Showcase Saturday, June 25, follows it with an afternoon barbecue performance at the Larimer Lounge on June 26, then heads to Colorado Springs on June 30 where the band will play at Hillside Gardens.</i>

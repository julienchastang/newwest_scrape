							We're kicking off a new feature for the <i>New West</i> Boulder page with a song by one of Colorado's most critically-acclaimed musicians, Otis Taylor.  Taylor has offered an MP3 of “Rosa Rosa�? from his 2003 album, <i>Truth Is Not Fiction</i>.<br />

In the midst of a career renaissance, Otis Taylor is single-handedly putting Colorado on the contemporary blues map. Beginning with 1998’s <i>When Negroes Walked The Earth</i>, Taylor has recorded six albums in eight years, each of them a nuanced, thought-provoking piece of art. His peers have recognized the important role his music plays in the future of the blues, nominating him for several W.C. Handy Awards (the top blues honor), including the one he won for Best New Artist in 2002. Taylor wasn’t exactly new to the game, however—he’d enjoyed a successful career as a sideman in the ‘60s and ‘70s before temporarily retiring from music in 1977 to become an antiques dealer and the coach of a professional bicycle team.<br />
<br />
Born in Chicago in 1948, Taylor and his family moved to Denver after the murder of his uncle (a disturbing event that he explores in 2001’s <i>White African</i>). Indeed, it’s Taylor’s reliance on harrowing family stories like this one for material that renders his music so raw and gripping.<br />
<br />

							<p>The Woody Creek Tavern, favorite hangout of the late Gonzo Hunter Thompson, was recently offered for sale by its owners, a move which occasioned a lot of hand-wringing on the part of longtime patrons.&nbsp; But as Al Lewis <a target="_blank" href="http://origin.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_5770943" title="reported in Sunday&#8217;s Denver Post">reported in Sunday&#8217;s Denver Post</a>, the matter is shaping up to be nothing more than a tempest in a teapot&#8212;or in Hunter Thompson&#8217;s case, a tempest in a bottle of Wild Turkey.&nbsp; John Colson of The Aspen Times <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20070420/NEWS/104200061/0/FRONTPAGE" title="reported the impending sale">reported the impending sale</a> of the Tavern earlier this month, and Lewis followed up, interviewing the buyer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The plan is to run it just exactly the way it is,&#8217; said Kevin Willson, who has owned the Wienerstube Restaurant in Aspen for decades and now has a contract to buy the tavern for an undisclosed price.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We have not changed the Wienerstube, and that&#8217;s our guarantee that we are not going to change Woody Creek.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Locals are skeptical. Woody Creek Tavern waitress Dianne Redfern told me a group of employees and regular customers approached actor Johnny Depp and asked him to buy it. &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t he want to buy it?&#8221; Redfern said. &#8220;He knew how important it was to Hunter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Depp, who portrayed Thompson in the 1998 film &#8220;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,&#8221; paid $2.5 million for Thompson&#8217;s extravagant send-off in 2005.
<br />
</p></blockquote>

Celebrities cited as The Woody Creek Tavern&#8217;s most famous patrons include Thompson, CBS reporter Ed Bradley, and disgraced Enron CEO Ken Lay, but as those three gentlemen are now deceased, the new ownership probably hopes some fresh faces will take their places at the bar.&nbsp; Earlier this month, Joseph Friedrichs wrote about the unique ambiance of the Tavern for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/from_bend_to_woody_creek_canyon/C426/L426/" title="NewWest.net">NewWest.net</a>.

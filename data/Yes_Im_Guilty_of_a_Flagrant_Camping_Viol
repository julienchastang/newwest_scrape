							When a ranger issues you printed instructions that tell you to set up your tent within 15 feet of the stake that marks a campsite, you damn well better.  I went backpacking in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nps.gov/romo/visit/index.html" title="Rocky Mountain National Park">Rocky Mountain National Park</a> this weekend, and returned from a hike to Lake Nanita to find our tent had been ticketed.  Weâ€™d set it up outside of the 15-foot radius, and apparently there are rangers tramping through the backcountry carrying rulers during the day to punish all rule-breakers.  <br />
<br />
The ranger seemed a little miffed; in addition to the official ticket, he left a handwritten note admonishing us to â€œ<u>move</u> your tentâ€? and â€œpick up your campsite when you leave.â€? As if we werenâ€™t going to!  Though our tent actions look shady, weâ€™re not that kind of campers, really! I noticed that the ranger had also destroyed a renegade campfire site that was set up by a previous camperâ€”he probably thought weâ€™d done that, too.  <br />
<br />
The ticket was for $25â€”a minor nuisance, but a little demoralizing because of the scolding he gave us.  I was happy to give $25 to the cause of sustaining such a wonderful national park, but suspiciously, we had to mail our fine to some government office in Georgia.  I hope the fine will benefit Rocky Mountain National Park, but it will probably go toward funding some unscrupulous senatorâ€™s pork barrel project. Live and learn: Next time youâ€™re backpacking in Rocky Mountain National Park, be sure to pack in a yard stick.

		<p>Jenny I had a similar experience this summer in Yellowstone.  All I wanted to do was float with my kids down a section of the river, not knowing this was against the rules. I took a pretty good dressing down from a volunteer, not even a real ranger.<br />
<br />
In their defense, after describing this incident to a friend of mine who is a ranger in Rocky Mountain National Park, he explained that the parks are under a huge amount of stress, including a $4.6 billion dollar backlog in maintenance (see <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coloradocollege.edu%2Fstateoftherockies%2F05ReportCard%2FNational_Parks.pdf">http://www.coloradocollege.edu/stateoftherockies/05ReportCard/National_Parks.pdf</a>).  And the number of visitors keeps on growing.  In response, the park service has taken somewhat draconian measures to ensure that the strict rules are followed, no exceptions.  In fact they won't even engage in a discussion about the rules - the standard answer from everyone I challenged about a rule was "I don't make the rules, I just enforce them".<br />
<br />
Our best bet is to continue as an indivivuals to buy our annual Parks pass, and to lobby for more funding.  Better yet, frequent the State parks in the Rocky Mountains, which are beautiful and a little less strict due to the lower visitor numbers.</p>

		<p>For what it's worth, as a former ranger (although not in law enforcement), I don't really see anything wrong w/ what he did in issuing you a ticket. Unfortunately there are a lot of backcountry idiots out there who will break every rule in the book and, as a result, end up not only severely impacting the backcountry, but also ruining other's experiences in the process. The individual ranger who issued your ticket had no way of knowing whether you were one of those individuals (nor do I). As such, I'd say it's better to err on the side of resource protection. And unfortunately that's exactly how we have to manage our public lands: for the lowest common human denominator.</p>

							A few interesting odds and ends have surfaced in the Colorado music scene recently:<br />
<br />
On Monday, Denverâ€™s primary representative in the national emo scene, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pmfs.net/" title="Planes Mistaken For Stars">Planes Mistaken For Stars</a>, announced that it has signed a new record deal with a California-based indie label, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abacusrecordings.com/" title="Abacus Recordings">Abacus Recordings</a>. The band was previously signed to No Idea Records, and that label will continue to release vinyl versions of the bandâ€™s recordings. PMFS plays raw, gut-bucket emo from the era before the genre was prettied-up for mass consumption by bands like Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional, but you donâ€™t have to take my word for it. Frontman Gared Oâ€™Donnell issued a typically abrasive missive about the label switch: â€œAbacus are good eggs and if anyone has a problem with any of this start your own band or eat s--t; either way try and have fun with it.â€?<br />
<br />
Last week, veteran Denver singer-songwriter Eric Shiveley announced that heâ€™s taking an unorthodox approach to the release of his new album, <i>El Diablo</i>.  Itâ€™ll be available for download exclusively from his website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericshiveley.com/mission%20bells.htm" title="ericshiveley.com">ericshiveley.com</a>.  He says he wonâ€™t be pressing any CDs, and fans can listen to all the songs for free. In email sent to area music journalists, Shiveley says that he decided to release the album in this way because heâ€™s been busy building a new house and studio in Alamosa. He also reports that his â€œband will be playing in the coming months, though Iâ€™ll be working much more getting music to college stations and looking for support from a small label.â€?<br />
<br />
Finally, on Tuesday Kati Llewellyn of Pitchfork Media reported a feel-good story (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/news/05-09/27.shtml" title=""The Hold Steady Not Too Cool for School"">"The Hold Steady Not Too Cool for School"</a>) involving New York indie scenesters The Hold Steady and Coloradoâ€™s very own Littleton High School.  Llewellyn writes: â€œOne of the Freshman Academy instructors, Thom Uhl, heard about the Hold Steady on NPRâ€™s <i>All Things Considered</i>, and thought that the bandâ€™s music and message would fit right in on Mental Health Mondays, a segment of the program directed at tackling various teen and social issues.  Uhl contacted the Hold Steady and, well, the rest is historyâ€¦â€?  The band will rock Littleton Highâ€™s gymnasium on October 25 during seventh period, which the thorough Llewellyn reports as being held from 12:40-2:10 p.m., and not a minute before or after!  The school is even holding a Hold Steady look-alike contestâ€”and Iâ€™ve got to be honest, music journalist though I am, I have no idea what they look like, but the kids will probably be more up on things.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully nobody will let local conservatives know that Littleton High is crawling with apparently liberal, NPR-listening educators spending tax-payer dollars on rock music and â€œMental Health Mondaysâ€?â€”theyâ€™d surely shut the party down and have kids praying instead if they knew. Those who graduated long ago and never want to set foot in a high school gymnasium again can catch the band later that day (October 25) at the Larimer Lounge, a fine, alcohol-serving venue in Denver.<br />

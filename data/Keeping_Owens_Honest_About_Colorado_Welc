							Last winter a controversy brewed in Colorado over whether to replace the classic "Welcome to Colorful Colorado" signs at the state's borders with a new design that is, in my opinion, egregiously lame.  (For the complete saga, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/4967/" title=""Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Colorful Colorado' Signs,"">"Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Colorful Colorado' Signs,"</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/5030/" title=""Beating Back the New 'Welcome to Colorado' Sign,"">"Beating Back the New 'Welcome to Colorado' Sign,"</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/5303/" title=""Governor Owens Pardons 'Colorful Colorado' Signs."">"Governor Owens Pardons 'Colorful Colorado' Signs."</a>) Today <a target="_blank" href="http://totemdenver.blogspot.com/2006/06/vintage-colorado-welcome-sign-will.html" title="blogger Andy Bosselman points out">blogger Andy Bosselman points out</a> that "Gov. Owens said heâ€™d cancel plans for the new signs if the legislature gave him $19 million to be spent on advertising intended to lure tourists. The legislature complied and Monday Owens signed that law into effect."  This should mean that the classic signs will be spared, but I noticed a disturbing photo in Tuesday's Rocky Mountain News that depicted a pro-tourism rally that took place at the 16th Street Mall Monday: In it, the banners behind the speakers are eerily like the Wal-Mart-esque design the artistic geniuses at Advancing Colorado developed to replace the "Welcome" signs.  <br />
<br />
Will the tasteless rapscallions at Advancing Colorado be content to use their lame design for banners and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.advancecolorado.com/branding/advancing-colorado.cfm" title="exciting clothing items">exciting clothing items</a>, or will they once again mount a stealth campaign to replace the beloved vintage signs?  They have apparently launched an elaborate "branding initiative" featuring the generic-looking logo with which they seem passionately in love.  Stay tuned...

		<p>Hey, they're gonna "infuse" the Colorado "brand"!!! I'd love to see the budget numbers and staff and consultant costs on this. Whew.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 6-08-06</b>
		<p>Update: The Rocky Mountain News reported today that Governor Owens has formally announced that the classic welcome signs will stay:<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockymountainnews.com%2Fdrmn%2Fother_business%2Farticle%2F0%2C2777%2CDRMN_23916_4758681%2C00.html">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4758681,00.html</a><br />
<br />
Roger Fillion writes that the proposal to change the signs "created an uproar among residents, editorial writers, politicians and bloggers."<br />
<br />
But Owens' term is up soon, so we still have to keep an eye on those sneaky Advancing Colorado branding folks once he leaves office.</p>

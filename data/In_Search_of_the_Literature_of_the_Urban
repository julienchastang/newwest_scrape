							<p>I recently received a question from a reader that stumped me.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://greatestshow.blogspot.com/" title="Michael Downs">Michael Downs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.umt.edu/journalism/news_pages/archives/April/April07/April1.07/michaeldowns.htm" title="a writer">a writer</a> and professor of Creative Writing at Towson University, wrote in to ask if I could suggest any literary nonfiction books set in a Western city (not a town) in which that city &#8220;seems to be or is a character&#8221; for a panel discussion he&#8217;s organizing on this topic.&nbsp; Downs says he&#8217;s found a number of such books set in the industrial northeast, and wants to balance the panel geographically.
</p>
<p>
My mind was totally blank, particularly about the cities he mentioned--Salt Lake, Denver, and Albuquerque.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve read a number of good histories of my hometown, Denver, such as those by Tom Noel and Phil Goodstein, but can&#8217;t think of a literary, narrative nonfiction book set in Denver.&nbsp; The best suggestion I could come up with was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tedconover.com/" title="Ted Conover's">Ted Conover&#8217;s</a> book on Aspen, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tedconover.com/whiteout.html" title="Whiteout: Lost in Aspen">Whiteout: Lost in Aspen</a></i>, but Aspen isn&#8217;t exactly a city.&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping that some readers will have some suggestions.
</p>
<p>
While I was thinking about Downs&#8217; nonfiction question, I realized that the same dearth applies to fiction set in the cities of the mountain West.&nbsp; As I&#8217;ve discussed before, there are hardly any novels set in contemporary Denver--characters in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Haruf" title="Kent Haruf's">Kent Haruf&#8217;s</a> last two novels have passed through the Mile High City, as did some characters in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Annie_Proulx" title="Annie Proulx's">Annie Proulx&#8217;s</a> last novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Old-Ace-Hole-Novel/dp/0743242483" title="That Old Ace in the Hole">That Old Ace in the Hole</a></I>.&nbsp; But these books are largely set elsewhere, and Denver is treated as the dirty, ominous big city, especially in Haruf&#8217;s books.&nbsp; Where&#8217;s the literary love for Denver?&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to reading a novel coming out this spring that&#8217;s set in Denver by a grad school friend of mine, Tara Yellen&#8217;s <i><a target="_blank" href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?r=1&amp;ean=9781932961485" title="After Hours at the Almost Home">After Hours at the Almost Home</a></i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unbridledbooks.com/" title="Unbridled Books">Unbridled Books</a>).
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve read some good Western urban literature set in Texas (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A81167" title="Dagoberto Gilb's">Dagoberto Gilb&#8217;s</a> charming, quirky first novel, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mej6lELKmM0C&amp;dq=dagoberto+gilb+last+known+residence+of&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=KtCMCAPnI7&amp;sig=OIJgYqCmW_EiFcnCCy0-poSrZ0U&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search?q=dagoberto+gilb+last+known+residence+of&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail#PPP1,M1" title="The Last Known Residence of Mickey Acu&#241;a">The Last Known Residence of Mickey Acu&#241;a</a></i>) and California (such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_alex_espinoza/C39/L39/" title="Alex Espinoza">Alex Espinoza</a>&#8216;s <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400065394" title="Still Water Saints">Still Water Saints</a></i>), but here closer to the Rockies where the air is thinner, the bookshelves of urban lit thin out too.
</p>
<p>
As I pondered this question further, I thought about the covers of the books in my recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/best_in_the_west_favorite_books_of_2007/C39/L39/" title="Best of 2007">Best of 2007</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/bes/C39/L39/" title="reading list">reading list</a>.&nbsp; And yes, I know you can&#8217;t judge a book by its cover, but I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that most of the covers feature an image of an animal, a rider, or a natural landscape.&nbsp; Do publishers refuse to publish anything set in the urban West, or are writers just not writing it?
</p>
<p>
I asked Michael Downs, and he wrote back: &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re right about most publishers being more interested in the rural West. I wonder if most writers share that same interest. For years I&#8217;ve sensed a romanticism to contemporary literature about the West, but couldn&#8217;t quite put my finger on it. The books I read didn&#8217;t treat their subjects romantically. Most are hard-core realism. But now I wonder whether there&#8217;s a kind of romanticism in the choice of that subject, no matter how the subject is treated. And I wonder whether the accumulation of so many writers and publishers choosing the rural West for subject matter (or the great Western landscape, or fly fishing, or whatever) constitutes its own kind of romanticism regardless of how the subject is treated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So what do you think?&nbsp; Am I overlooking some notable literature of the urban West (particularly that of the cities of the Rocky Mountain West), or is it just not out there?&nbsp; And do you agree that publishers and/or writers treat the West in the romantic way that Downs has suggested?&nbsp; I for one am stumped.

		<p>Drew Goodman, the General Books Sales Manager at the University of Utah's campus store emailed me with his thoughts on the literature of the urban West:<br />
<br />
"As I read your article, I too struggled to find literary fiction or non-fiction set in the American West.  I can think of quite a number of books that are set in the urban west, but most tend to fall into genre categories:<br />
 <br />
John Dunning (mystery)- Denver<br />
Stephen White (suspense)- Denver/Salt Lake City<br />
Judith Van Gieson (mystery)- Albuquerque/Santa Fe<br />
Gordon Campbell (legal mystery)- Phoenix<br />
Neil McMahon (thriller)- Helena<br />
James Grippando (mystery)- Boulder/Denver<br />
 <br />
Many books (not just the authors above) seem to fall into the mystery/thriller/crime categories.  I guess our urban west is great for mysteries and crime stories, but left lacking in settings for literary fiction."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Clayton, 12-28-07</b>
		<p>Jenny, I think part of the problem here is that we tend to define "The West" so as to exclude urban areas. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and L.A. have great urban lit but those of us in drier climes see them as a different culture. Same with Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. Indeed, from here in Montana I'm tempted to say that even Phoenix and Vegas are not part of the West -- in the same way Florida is not part of the South -- they are tourist/retiree cultures unto themselves.<br />
<br />
That may touch off lengthy debates about What Is The West... but my point is that many of us tend to define it as not-urban, and furthermore as a region where the major cities (Denver, SLC, and... ummm... Billings?) tend to be regional centers rather than self-contained urban cultures. Thus it's not surprising that the literature goes "to the source" of the rural life itself.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Talia, 12-28-07</b>
		<p>I agree.  I haven't read much that is like my experience.  I do interact with nature, I do ski and chop wood and carry water, but I live in an University town and I get to hang out with compassionate, educated people.  I get to go to a bar without barfights (or smoke!), I get to see the state poet laureate speak, go to gallery walks, and most of the people I know speak multiple languages.  It's not that I don't appreciate ranch culture.  Also I love our state's blue collar culture.<br />
<br />
It's just that when I want literature of the "local" areas, I just don't find writing about the things I love about living here.  When I read nature writing, I still go back to the classics with Farley Mowat, Gary Paulson and Ed Abbey.  I'm sure there are new greats out there, but I'll wait until one of my bookish friends recommends them: I've wasted my time on too many poorly-written (and depressing) duds that are cherished because they're "local."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mike Welsh, 12-28-07</b>
		<p>Perhaps the problem of the urban West's identity began with Henry David Thoreau's claim that the East represented all that was bad with civilization, but "westward I go free."  The oft-criticized historian Frederick Jackson Turner said little about the urban frontier as he glorified democracy's home in the American backwoods.  Hollywood celebrated this vision a century ago with films made in New Jersey about western train robbers, and tourism rarely includes the urban experience anywhere in the West.  Even the field of the 20th century American West, with its logical emphasis on cities and suburbs, gets little traction in textbooks that speak more to the small percentage of rural residents.  One might read the work of Gerald D. Nash to get a sense of the sameness and difference of the urban West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 12-29-07</b>
		<p>Jenny: As always, you bring up great topics of conversation (debate, even) about writing in the Rocky Mountain West. I think you and Michael Downs have stumped the panel on the question of distinctive creative nonfiction set in the urban West. There are some fine passages in "The Tender Bar" by J.R. Moehringer about growing up in Tucson, although most of the book takes place in the Northeast. I can't name any literary nonfiction books set in my hometown of Denver, or any of the "urban centers" of Wyoming, where I live. "Riding the White Horse Home" takes place in Laramie County, the most populous in the state, but mostly on Teresa' Jordan's family ranch north of Cheyenne. Same goes for James Galvin's "The Meadow," set on his ranch south of Laramie. Tim Sandlin has written some thinly-disguised satire about Jackson, more resort town than city. <br />
<br />
There are more examples in literary fiction, especially short stories. Richard Ford's excellent collection "Rock Springs" features the title story and "Great Falls." But "Rock Springs" is more about passing through than living there. Ron Carlson's story "Governor's Ball" is a day-in-the-life set in Salt Lake City. His recent how-to book about short story writing dissects that piece. He's also written fine stories set in Phoenix. Annie Proulx's stories focus on quirky rural life, but she has dropped into Casper and Cheyenne in some of them. I wish that Montana's Rick Bass would visit some of the state's cities occasionally. I loved what he did with Houston in some of his earlier stories. <br />
<br />
I'm a city boy from the West. My stories in "The Weight of a Body" are set in Denver, Salt Lake City, and Cheyenne. Last year I wandered out to my cousin Jimmy's ranch in Eastern Colorado for a branding and used it in a story, "Call me Robert," published last year in UW's Owen Wister Review. My cousin Jimmy said I got the details of the branding mostly right, but that I should stick to city life.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Downs, 12-30-07</b>
		<p>Thanks to all for your comments thus far on this topic. Sounds to me as if there might be an opportunity for good literary nonfiction about Western cities awaiting the ambitious Western writer (Jenny? Denver?). Perhaps few publishers would go for the manuscripts, but it sounds as if there might be a market if readers feel as some of us writers do: that there is a story to be told about the urban Rockies. Clearly, the growth and success of New West.net suggests such a possibility. If there is good journalism about the urban West, can good literary nonfiction in book form be too far behind?<br />
<br />
All of this came up for me, by the by, because I did write a book of literary nonfiction in which a city acted as a character: Hartford, Connecticut, which is my hometown. In the book, Hartford stood in contrast to Tucson, where I did much of my growing up. But I chose to write about Hartford and not Tucson. Part of that, I think, is because even though I lived in Tucson for 13 years, attended jr. high, high school, and college there, and worked a newspaper reporter there for a a few years, I still felt a visitor there, not connected, not rooted. Perhaps, given the largely transient population of the urban West, that transience itself is a story to be told.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 12-30-07</b>
		<p>"Transience" does seem to be the West's main theme. But you'd think that would be enough of a subject to hang a book upon. After all, most of "On the Road" takes place in the West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Rebecca Powell, 12-31-07</b>
		<p>Anaya has featured Albuquerque in many of his novels, though fiction.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Downs, 12-31-07</b>
		<p>And Deirdre McNamer featured Missoula in her novel "My Russian." I think there are plenty of examples of novelists featuring the urban West in their fiction (though not nearly as many as feature the rural West). But I'm still curious why the urban West has been so largely left out of narrative literary nonfiction. I'm enjoying the arguments made here, though, and look forward to reading other theories.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 1-02-08</b>
		<p>The December 24 & 31 issue of The New Yorker has a story by Raymond Carver that I think qualifies as a piece of Western urban lit—"Beginners," better known as "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."  "Beginners" is the longer version, before Gordon Lish's edits.  It's set in Albuquerque.  At first glance, it seems like the kind of story in which the setting doesn't much matter, as the action is confined to the two couples and their animated conversation inside a house.  It's mentioned that Herb's ex-wife "moved to Denver with the kids," and this might have been any semi far-away city.  <br />
<br />
But on rereading it, I noticed that the narrator keeps having these thoughts about and interactions with the natural landscape that's just outside the window.  The ending is especially rooted in the landscape:<br />
<br />
"The shower stopped running. In a minute, I heard whistling as Herb opened the bathroom door. I kept looking at the women at the table. Terri was still crying and Laura was stroking her hair. I turned back to the window. The blue layer of sky had given way now and was turning dark like the rest. But stars had appeared. I recognized Venus and, farther off and to the side, not as bright but unmistakably there on the horizon, Mars. The wind had picked up. I looked at what it was doing to the empty fields. I thought unreasonably that it was too bad the McGinnises no longer kept horses. I wanted to imagine horses rushing through those fields in the near-dark, or even just standing quietly with their heads in opposite directions near the fence. I stood at the window and waited. I knew I had to keep still a while longer, keep my eyes out there, outside the house, as long as there was something left to see."<br />
<br />
I don't remember if those nature-y parts are in the Lish-edited story or not—I have to dig up my copy of it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's one more story to add to the rather small list of Western urban lit:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ffiction%2Ffeatures%2F2007%2F12%2F24%2F071224fi_fiction_carver%3FcurrentPage%3D10">http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2007/12/24/071224fi_fiction_carver?currentPage=10</a><br />
<br />
I also thought of Katherine Anne Porter's "Pale Horse, Pale Rider," which is set in Denver during the 1918 influenza epidemic.  I just love this story.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jim Betsy, 1-11-08</b>
		<p>The Seattle-based NW art historian (and excellent performing and visual arts critic), Reiko Sundahl, has also published a series of experimental short fiction online under the collect-all title, "TALES OF MONTANA," as well as the full-length satiric road novel, "TANNER & RHEE." <br />
These TALES OF MONTANA are historic and contemporary, rural and urban, favoring none of these poles but implying how past and present, city and countryside, are inextricably woven through each other in any true Western (de-romanticized) outlook. Though the urban-landscape which portrays such Montana cities as Great Falls and Butte, is more psychological with Sundahl than literal, even so a hard place-based materiality is felt in her imagistic prose.<br />
Sundahl's (126 chapter, 400-page) novel, TANNER & RHEE, begins in Seattle and Los Angeles, but really does not get its engine fully revved until 10 chapters (25 pages) into the narrative, when the tale hits Billings. Albeit, a very fictionalized Billings that could be any number of medium-sized cities in the West. While the story (250 pages later) does meanders for awhile into rural Montana, it works its way back to Billings. That is where the title character, 15 year old Rhee (a modern day Huck Finn), 'finds' her true self. Her development as a human being is embedded in her engagement in the politics, history, and culture of that particular urban environment, at a particular juncture in its history (1997).<br />
Both TALES OF MONTANA and TANNER & RHEE can be tasted at the 'Culture & Politics' forum at Artdish.com (Seattle's preeminent art-crit site where I too post criticism and aesthetic theory), with Sundahl's tales (posted May 2007 - October 2007) starting on or near this page: <br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artdish.com%2Fubbcgi-bin%2Fultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dforum%26f%3D7%26hardset%3D1000%26start_point%3D200">http://www.artdish.com/ubbcgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum&f=7&hardset=1000&start_point=200</a> <br />
Few Western writers grapple as thoughtfully with how landscape and urban perspectives interweave, and shape individual identity, in our corner of this planet. Reiko Sundahl is a rare one. Her prose, in this and other ways, steps into a new frontier.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jim Betsy, 1-11-08</b>
		<p>p.s.<br />
The first of Reiko Sundahl's tales, "Dead Piegan Creek - 1900, May 29," while rural, acutely sets up the rural-urban byplay that characterizes these "tales." It's direct link is:<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artdish.com%2Fubbcgi-bin%2Fultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dget_topic%26f%3D7%26t%3D000228">http://www.artdish.com/ubbcgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=7&t=000228</a> <br />
<br />
And the satiric novel TANNER & RHEE begins here:<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artdish.com%2Fubbcgi-bin%2Fultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dget_topic%26f%3D7%26t%3D000239">http://www.artdish.com/ubbcgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=7&t=000239</a> <br />
And ends here, Chapter 126 (about 400 book pages in):<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artdish.com%2Fubbcgi-bin%2Fultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dget_topic%26f%3D7%26t%3D000411">http://www.artdish.com/ubbcgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=7&t=000411</a> <br />
<br />
And a characteristic, though particularly resonant, 3-page Sundahl chapter from TANNER & RHEE (Chapter 82, 'Long Shadows') can be tasted here:<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artdish.com%2Fubbcgi-bin%2Fultimatebb.cgi%3Fubb%3Dget_topic%26f%3D7%26t%3D000345">http://www.artdish.com/ubbcgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=7&t=000345</a></p>

		<p>Speaking of literature of the urban west--I've been trying my hand at writing it.  My novel "Mile High," set in Denver, is a semi-finalist in this American-Idol type contest sponsored by Amazon.com, so now I am shamelessly trolling for people to review a chapter of it so I can advance in the competition.  If you're willing, check it out here (It's under my fiction writing name, J. Alicia Shank):<br />

<br />
I'd really appreciate the feedback.</p>

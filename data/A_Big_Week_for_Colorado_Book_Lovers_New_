							Yesterday, Denver mayor John Hickenlooper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4505876" title="announced the third selection for the One Book, One Denver program">announced the third selection for the One Book, One Denver program</a>:  <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i> by John Nichols.  The critically-acclaimed novel,  published in 1974 and made into a feature film in 1988, should please most participants in the program, now in its third year.  Past selections were <i>Peace Like a River</i> by Leif Enger and <i>Caramelo</i> by Sandra Cisneros.   The only drawback of <i>Milagro</i> as a selection is that for the third time, the committee has decided to go with a novel that isn't set in Colorado and wasn't written by a Colorado author.  Still, it's regionally relevant, set in New Mexico, and it's clear from the three selections so far that the people behind One Book, One Denver are more interested in selecting a book that can appeal to the widest possible audience than they are in promoting the work of local authors.  A number of One Book, One Denver events are scheduled for the coming months, including a Tattered Cover  appearance by Nichols  on November 14.<br />
<br />
Tonight the 15th Annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradocenterforthebook.org/Colorado_Book_Awards.htm" title="Colorado Book Awards">Colorado Book Awards</a> will be held at the Seawell Grand Ballroom  in the Denver Center for Performing Arts (5:30 p.m., $65-$75).  The event is sponsored by the Colorado Center for the Book, and the price of admission includes a copy of one of the finalist's books.  It will be a Colorado star-studded event, with Nick Forster of E-Town serving as the M.C., and Nick Urata of DeVotchKa performing.  <br />
<br />
The finalists for this year's book awards are as strong as they've ever been.  In fiction alone,  there's an acclaimed  World War II novel, <i>Articles of War</i> by <a target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~nickarvin/home.html" title="Nick Arvin">Nick Arvin</a>, who recently published a story in the <i>New Yorker</i>,  a strong small press contender in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laurapritchett.com/" title="Laura Pritchett">Laura Pritchett</a>'s  <i>Sky Bridge</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/3840/" title="which I reviewed here last year">which I reviewed here last year</a>),  a book of literary historical fiction, <i>The Wild Girl</i>, by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jimfergus.com/" title="Jim Fergus">Jim Fergus</a>, and an entry by perennial Colorado favorite, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamhouston.net/" title="Pam Houston">Pam Houston</a>.  I found the book <i>Sight Hound</i> heartfelt yet cheesy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insidedenver.com/drmn/books/article/0,1299,DRMN_63_3485479,00.html" title="when I reviewed it">when I reviewed it</a> for the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> last year, but Houston could still pull off a win based on her reputation for incisive, amusing short fiction.<br />
<br />
Stand-outs in other categories include J.R. Moehringer's  <i>The Tender  Bar</i> in creative nonfiction (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,1299,DRMN_63_4065743,00.html" title="which I gushed over in a review last year">which I gushed over in a review last year</a>), and <i>Comeback Wolves</i>, an anthology of essays on the reintroduction of wolves in Colorado.  Plus, there are plenty of books that are just plain useful,  including hiking guides, local histories, and wildlife books.<br />
<br />
Bookish Coloradoans have enjoyed a literary feast this October, with the One Book, One Denver announcement, the Colorado Book Awards, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp;jsessionid=ag6EDWML34Qdqvm-x5?s=storeevents" title="a packed slate of national authors">a packed slate of national authors</a> visiting the Tattered Cover.  Francine Prose and Janet Fitch have already swung through Denver this month, and still to come is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jenniferegan.com/" title="Jennifer Egan">Jennifer Egan</a>, whose new novel, <i>The Keep</i> is a terrific, smart, page-turner.  She'll appear at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&eventId=332072" title="the Colfax Tattered Cover">the Colfax Tattered Cover</a> on October 25 at 7:30 p.m. <br />

							This weekend, I found my regular grocery storeâ€”the Boulder Safeway on 28th and Irisâ€”in a state of organizational upheaval, and my shopping took twice as long as usual as I wandered through the store, trying to figure out where theyâ€™d moved everything.  It made me think about how strongly I identify particular grocery stores with periods of my life and places I have lived.  When I first lived in Boulder during grad school, I frequented the Safeway on Arapahoe and 28th Street. Then I moved to Capitol Hill in Denver and for four years shopped at the King Soopers on Clarkson, a store popularly known as â€œQueen Soopersâ€? because of its proximity to the stateâ€™s largest concentration of gay people, and for the interesting, often androgynous characters to be found roaming its aisles, especially after ten p.m. <br />
<br />
When I moved back to Boulder in 2004, I found that my old Safeway on Arapahoe no longer suited my post-college life. It looked dingy and drab, its produce uninspiring, a store best left for students wandering down from campus to stock up on their Doritos and Twinkies.  But then the new Safeway opened on Iris, and it was the Shangri-La of Safeways, with aisles so wide and lights so bright it could be the inhabitant of an impoverished countryâ€™s dream vision of an American supermarket. I was briefly tempted to switch to the King Soopers on Arapahoe, which offers double coupons (a real enticement, as I am my motherâ€™s daughter), but the sunny new Safeway drew me away.  <br />
<br />
Safeway offered shopping serenity, especially compared to the jam-packed Whole Foods Market, where aisles are small and customersâ€™ tempers shortâ€”this weekend, a ridiculous spandex-wearing man there flew into a rage at me about who was next in line for a table in the chaotic dining area.  No wonder they offer massages and herbal stress aids at Whole Foodsâ€”after shopping there, you need them.<br />
<br />
Once youâ€™ve frequented a particular grocery store for a few months, you begin to know its layout so well that you can fly through it quickly.  So this weekend when I found Safeway rearranged, I felt that disorienting, almost dream-like sensation that comes from visiting an unfamiliar grocery store in another town.  <br />
<br />
The first sign of disorder were the huge bins of discounted items that had been belched forward from the aisles during the reorganizing process. Strange hosiery, hair products, low-carb bars, experimental oils, and snack foods whose advertising campaigns had failed them were on offer at deep markdowns, and as I glanced at them I felt like I was looking at an assortment of odd deep sea creaturesâ€”who knew these bizarre things were hiding out there?<br />
<br />
Then I noticed that the aisle Safeway has decided to call â€œHispanic Foodsâ€? had been moved forward to a more prominent location.  Could this be a sign of a demographic shift in the neighborhood, or just an indication that in Boulder, white folks like their tamales?  The bulk of one aisle is now devoted exclusively to bottled water and water-like products alone.  The snake oil medicine men have clearly won now that itâ€™s suddenly no longer okay to drink tap water.  I also noticed that Safeway has moved the shampoo and conditioner out of the aisle of sundry unmentionables (tampons, condoms, pregnancy tests, Rogaine), perhaps to alleviate the innocent shampoo-buyerâ€™s embarrassment over walking down that aisle of shame. <br />
<br />
Feeling a bit lost and unmoored, I looked for some sign that this was still my Safeway.  I found it in my favorite checkout clerk, Ludmilla.  Ludmilla is a statuesque, blue-eyed redhead with a Russian accent who does her job efficiently and cheerfully, never failing, as some other cashiers do, to mention whatever promotion Safeway has going on (â€œWould you like to donate one dollar for the Breast Cancer?  No? Okay fine.â€?)  Ludmilla is the woman you go to when youâ€™re buying something from the aisle of shame, because sheâ€™s so clearly not squeamish or judgmental.  She works so quickly that she can be a little rough with the merchandise, taking no more care with eggs or bananas than she does with anything else, pounding it all down on the conveyor.  <br />
<br />
I go to Ludmilla specifically for such chastisement of my produce.  After all, I have never had to endure a three-day-long wait in line at a Soviet grocery store where the only goods on offer were limp cabbage and moldy pork chops. This weekend she thumped my bananas down as if to shame me for my silly, internal complaints about the storeâ€™s reorganization.  I should be thankful that I live in a country with such nice supermarkets.  Even if the â€œHispanic Foodsâ€? have migrated east, itâ€™s still a damn good grocery store.  Ludmilla is right to punish me.<br />

<b>Night Drive on I-80</b>
</p>
<p>
by Peter Anderson
</p>
<p>
Remember when you were headed west out of Wamsutter 
<br />
measuring the after midnight miles with a half-emptied sixpack
<br />
and you had the hammer down and nothing but empty up ahead?
</p>
<p>
Remember, somewhere west of Bitter Creek, you stopped 
<br />
for that roughnecked renegade leaning into the wind, who told 
<br />
you he was so hungry he could eat the ass off a skunk?
</p>
<p>
Remember the eatum-up truck stop neon, blazing like Christmas 
<br />
with the voltage cranked and all those big buckets of bolts 
<br />
blowing diesel in the parking lot?
</p>
<p>
Remember how your roughneck pal went silent over chicken fried steak, 
<br />
and you picked at a piece of pie from the Pleistocene, but the cat-eyed 
<br />
waitress called you &#8220;hun&#8221; and made it all ok?
</p>
<p>
Remember dropping your new friend off at daybreak&#8212;highway 189 
<br />
north to Diamondville&#8212;and how he told you to keep the shiny 
<br />
side up and the greasy side down, and how you said &#8220;fer sure&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
and how it was easier to believe, back then, that everyone 
<br />
was a good buddy just waiting to happen?
</p>

<b>Climbing after a Fall</b>

I hold back, feel the pull 
<br />
of gravity through my boot. 
<br />
Mac says it will be easy 
<br />
scaling the vertical 
<br />
rock face full of cracks 
<br />
and quarter-inch ledges. 
<br />
I climb and granite 
<br />
turns to flat gray. 
<br />
Handholds visible from below 
<br />
vanish at a certain height. 
<br />
Everything is gone&#8212; 
<br />
summer grass, Mac&#8217;s red car 
<br />
gleaming from the road, 
<br />
green silhouette of tamarack 
<br />
against blue sky, screech 
<br />
of a redtail hawk. All gone&#8212; 
<br />
even the wind that blew 
<br />
dust across the dirt 
<br />
road when I took my first 
<br />
look at the wall. 
<br />
All that is left 
<br />
is rock, my body pressed 
<br />
against it like a lover,
<br />
the pull of gravity
<br />
seductive.

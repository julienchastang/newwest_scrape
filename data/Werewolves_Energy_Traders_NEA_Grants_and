							<p>You may recall New West&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_benjamin_percy_part_1/C39/L39/" title="recent interview">recent interview</a> with Oregon native Benjamin Percy about his first novel, <I>The Wilding</I>.&nbsp; The book has drawn raves from just about every publication that reviews books, and though it&#8217;s only been out for a couple of months, Percy is already looking ahead to his next book, <I>Red Moon</I>, a novel that recently sold at auction to Grand Central/Hachette for publication in the Fall of 2012.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/27XsBx/www.variety.com/article/VR1118027901/r:t" title="Variety reported">Variety reported</a> last week that the Gotham Group has optioned the film rights to <I>Red Moon</I>.

&#8220;[<I>Red Moon</I> is] described as an alternate history tome, story is set in a post-9/11 world of xenophobia in which the long-persecuted Lycans live among humans. Story kicks off with a Lycan uprising that results in a clash of civilizations.&nbsp; Book proposal was acquired in a pub house bidding war by Grand Central. Lit deal is pegged at $500,000.&#8221;

<p>
That is some actual money right there.&nbsp; Author and philosopher Jay-Z might even call it &#8220;cheddar.&#8221;  Congratulations to Benjamin Percy on all his success.&nbsp; I told you so.&nbsp; Remember two years ago when I ordered you to check out his story collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_benjamin_percy/C39/L39/" title="Refresh, Refresh">Refresh, Refresh</a></I>?

&#8226; The National Endowment for the Arts recently announced its <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/11grants/litFellows.php " title="2010 Literature Fellowships">2010 Literature Fellowships</a>, and two Denver poets were lucky winners.&nbsp; Jennifer Denrow, who is pursuing her PhD at the University of Denver, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/English/faculty/facpages/carr.shtml" title="Julie Carr">Julie Carr</a>, who teaches at the University of Colorado, will each receive $25,000.&nbsp; Rebecca Lindenberg of Salt Lake City also received the prestigious grant.

&#8226; A few months ago I mentioned that Idaho State MFA student <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/university_of_idaho_students_poem_to_run_in_the_new_yorker/C39/L39/" title="Ciara Shuttleworth's poem "Sestina" was accepted for publication in The New Yorker">Ciara Shuttleworth&#8217;s poem &#8220;Sestina&#8221; was accepted for publication in The New Yorker</a>. Luke Baumgarten wrote a great profile of Shuttleworth for <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.inlander.com/spokane/article-15909-succinct-not-pithy.html" title="The Pacific Northwest Inlander">The Pacific Northwest Inlander</a>.&nbsp; Shuttleworth&#8217;s poem appears in the November 29 issue of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/poetry/2010/11/29/101129po_poem_shuttleworth" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a>.&nbsp; Baumgarten describes the poem in this way:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The poem that Shuttleworth transcribed, halting and elliptical, tells the story of a person who once felt loved, and who now feels betrayed &#8212; and also, in a sense, culpable &#8212; while being unsure what to do about those emotions. The whole thing, read aloud, is over in maybe 15 seconds.&#8221;
<br />

&#8226; Denver&#8217;s Cortright McMeel is getting ready to celebrate the release of his first novel, <I>Short</I>, with the help of the Lighthouse Writers Workshop, where he teaches fiction writing.&nbsp; McMeel will be the star of <a target="_blank" href="https://lighthousewriters.org/page/view/id/64/" title="Lighthouse's December Writer's Buzz">Lighthouse&#8217;s December Writer&#8217;s Buzz</a> on Saturday, December 11 at 910 Arts (910 Santa Fe Boulevard), 7 p.m., free.&nbsp; McMeel recently moved to Colorado from Baltimore, where he founded the crime fiction magazine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.murdalandmagazine.com/backissues/issue1/notesoncontributors.html" title="Murdaland">Murdaland</a>.&nbsp; McMeel also worked for several years as an energy trader, an experience that inspired his novel.&nbsp; Look for more on the book here soon.

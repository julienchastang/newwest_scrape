		<h1>Authors Hustle to Promote Books &amp; Oregon Seeks New Poet Laureate</h1>

							<p>By Jenny Shank, 1-27-10</p>
			
			
							<p>In her article &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_14242262" title="Authors go it alone in new literary landscape">Authors go it alone in new literary landscape</a>&#8221; for the Denver Post Sunday book section, Colleen Smith wrote about Tama Kieves and John Thorndike, two authors &#8220;with Denver ties&#8221; who have thrown themselves into promotion for their books.&nbsp; (Smith doesn&#8217;t mention what those ties are for Thorndike; Kieves lives in Denver, and Thorndike lives in Athens, Ohio).
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.awakeningartistry.com/contactUs.php" title="Tama Kieves">Tama Kieves</a> originally self-published her self-help book, <I> This Time I Dance!: Creating the Work You Love: How One Harvard Lawyer Left It All To Have It All</I>, and Smith writes: &#8220;Kieves keeps up constant efforts, including speaking at conferences and to congregations. &#8216;I travel like crazy on my own dime because speaking in front of people has been the best exposure for the book,&#8217; she said. &#8216;I&#8217;m the face of that book and the voice of that book. I will usually make money through workshops and book sales, but I&#8217;m always taking that risk.&#8217;&#8221;  Smith continues, &#8220;four months after self-publishing her book, Penguin Tarcher signed her with a $75,000 advance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
John Thorndike demonstrated equal hustle, traveling across the country for his last book and contacting hundreds of people he thought might be interested in the topic of his latest book, <I>The Last of His Mind: A Year in the Shadow of Alzheimer&#8217;s</I>.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Smith&#8217;s contributor&#8217;s note at the end of the article reveals that she&#8217;s not a disinterested party to the topic she discussed.&nbsp; She will self-publish her first novel, <I>Glass Halo</I>, this spring.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
What interested me about her story is that according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fridayjonespublishing.com/Friday_Jones_Publishing/Meet_the_Author.html" title="Q&amp;A on her website">Q&amp;A on her website</a>, Smith attended the Iowa Writer&#8217;s Workshop, which seems like it must be the magic ticket to traditional publication.&nbsp; But not for everyone, apparently.&nbsp; Smith writes, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a flack, a hack, a bluestocking, a blogger, and have done just about every other writerly job in between.&#8221;  She writes that she decided to self-publish after she began blogging:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Something started to shift.&nbsp; I realized I could walk through these doors rather than playing &#8216;Captain May I?&#8217; with the typical gatekeepers.&nbsp; There was no word count.&nbsp; No editing&#8212;which is good and bad.&nbsp; It felt like working without a net, but I found it liberating.&#8221;  Smith will publish <I>Glass Halo</I> this year after having worked on it for 26 years.
</p>

&#8226; Oregon Cultural Trust is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonpoetlaureate.org/" title="currently seeking nominations">currently seeking nominations</a> for the state&#8217;s next poet laureate.&nbsp; And the Oregon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.literary-arts.org/pim/" title="Poetry in Motion">Poetry in Motion</a> program, which &#8220;brings poetry into the everyday lives of commuters by placing artfully designed poem cards on public buses and trains,&#8221; is hosting an online vote to determine which poems will be featured next.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitefishreview.com/" title="Whitefish Review">Whitefish Review</a> will host a reading and slideshow presentation with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jonturk.net/" title="Jon Turk">Jon Turk</a> at Crush Wine Bar in Whitefish on Tuesday, January 26 (7 p.m., slideshow begins at 8 p.m.).&nbsp; Turk has lived for many years in Darby, Montana, and his third book, <i>The Raven&#8217;s Gift: A Scientist, a Shaman and Their Remarkable Journey Through the Siberian Wilderness</i>, was just released by St. Martin&#8217;s Press.

		<b>Comment By Colleen Smith, 2-21-10</b>
		<p>Thanks for this piece, which I found by accident today while trying to find an old article I'd published. As for John Thorndike's links to the Denver area, he lived in Boulder for years; and his son is still in the area, so he returns frequently.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 2-22-10</b>
		<p>Thanks for the info, Colleen, and good luck with your novel.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Colleen Smith, 2-22-10</b>
		<p>Jenny, if you're in the Facebook cult, please join us, if you will, as a fan of Friday Jones Publishing. Lots of bits about books, authors, publishing. (And dogs!) Again, thanks for what you're doing on behalf of books and writers.</p>

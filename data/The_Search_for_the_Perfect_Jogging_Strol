							The other day an acquaintance mentioned that he'd seen me jogging on the Goose Creek Path in Boulder.  "Were you having a particularly bad run?" he asked.  "It looked like you had gone out too far."  I've never been a very graceful or skilled runner—just a persistent one—but at least now I can blame my awkwardness and theatrical grimaces on the fact that I'm six months pregnant.  I can't really call what I do now running, or even jogging—<i>slogging</i> is perhaps the most accurate term.  Yes, I'm an ugly runner.  But that doesn't mean I don't enjoy running, and as I get older I've been catching up with the other runners in my age category in the Bolder Boulder 10K through sheer attrition.  Just give me until I'm 70: I could be a contender.  <br />
<br />
With a baby arriving in a few months, I knew I had to find the proper equipment to allow me to continue running.  I thought it would be easy to find an affordable, high quality, used jogging stroller—but I live in Boulder, a town swathed in bike paths and swarming with supremely motivated in-shape people, and my search for a jogging stroller in this competitive market became a daunting quest.<br />
<br />
I wanted to find a sturdy stroller, one able to withstand my 5-jog-a-week habit, and tolerate the occasional dirt trail foray.  I found a helpful website, <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/www/family/jogging-strollers/index.html"title="ConsumerSearch">ConsumerSearch</a>, which summarizes and compiles the reviews of various magazines and websites.  This helped me immeasurably, because the names of jogging strollers alone are confusing (one recommended model is called the Kool Stride Senior, which sounds like an orthopedic shoe for women of a certain age).  I learned from the website's research that the ultimate in jogging strollers is something called the "BOB Sport Utility D'lux Stroller."  According to the website, "<a href="http://outside.away.com/outside/gear/gearguy/200407/20040702.html" title="Outside Magazine">Outside Magazine</a> says this is one of the few jogging strollers that does well on dirt trails; writer Gretchen Reynolds especially likes the front fender, which keeps dirt away from your baby."  The only problem: a new BOB stroller retails for around $350-$375. I've lived in apartments where the monthly rent was less.<br />
<br />
But now that I'd zeroed in on the best model for Boulder running, I figured I'd be able to find a used one for sale in the area.  My first stop was <a href="http://denver.craigslist.org/bab/" title="Craig's List">Craig's List</a>, where I posted a plea for the stroller.  I received a few responses, including one from a Georgia woman who offered her used BOB for $225 and sagely observed, " I don’t think there are as many people here in Atlanta that care about a BOB stroller as there are out West."  Others wanted $250, not including shipping.  <br />
<br />
I checked out <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?cgiurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.com%2Fws%2F&fkr=1&from=R8&satitle=bob+sport+utility+stroller+ironman&category0=" title="eBay">eBay</a>, where many new and used jogging strollers were selling briskly—but the bidding usually seemed to push their sale price up to between $210 and $270, not including $40 in shipping.  I listlessly bid on a few auctions, but the price always climbed higher than I was willing to pay.  I don't have the gambling spirit and obsessive monitoring skills that promote eBay triumphs.  Most of the strollers on the site sold for a cost that was barely discounted from their retail price, whether they were used or not, demonstrating that this product has such cachet among running parents that it retains its value better than the average used car.<br />
<br />
In January, I discovered that the nearby <a href="http://www.rei.com/category/9686093.htm" title="REI">REI</a> store was offering two of last year's floor models—a design called the BOB "Ironman"—for $275.   I hesitated.  The strollers were brand new, in a sporty yellow shade, the canopy embroidered with an "Ironman" logo that was sure to appeal to hyper competitive Boulderite dad types.  Personally, I would feel a little self-conscious slogging behind a product that proclaimed my athletic prowess in that way.  The front of my stroller should bear the motto: "Jes' doin' my best!" On the back it should read: "I'll be coming up on your right, bye and bye."  Still, I worried that if I didn't take the Ironman at that price, someone else would snap it up.  I ended up visiting the strollers three times before I decided $275 was just too much. <br />
<br />
Next, I found a local used kids sporting goods store called <a href="http://www.trail-kids.com/" title="Trail Kids">Trail Kids</a> that allows you to put your name on a wish list for certain items.  After about two months on the wait list, someone from the store called and said they had received a gently used BOB stroller.  I went to visit it—it was the current model, in very good condition, with only a few spots of dirt.  The store was asking $200 for it.  Still a lot of money.  But the salesclerk let me take it on a jog around the block, and it felt good and sturdy, a device that would surely help me return to running 10Ks in no time.   He patiently showed me how to fold it, take off its wheels, put its wheels back on and unfold it.  I was so tired of caring about jogging strollers.  I decided to end the quest right there, and bought it.  I know next week I'll see a BOB for $150 somewhere.  But that's okay.  I'm on to the next problem: How the hell am I supposed to buy a crib?<br />

		<p>Great story, Jenny. We are all now suitably intimidated at the mere thought of buying a jogging stroller! Modern motherhood isn't for the faint of heart. I'm sure your crib purchase will be equally entertaining...</p>

		<p>I recently had a baby and have been going through your EXACT same search! I CAN NOT believe how pricy these strollers are and how very few people are willing to depart with them once they own one. I finally sunk in and purchased the new 2007 sport utility, with it's rugged tires for all terrains. It's an awesome stroller, HOWEVER DO NOT plan on using this with your infant car seat in it, it makes the stroller so heavy and unmaneuvarable. I also found it for a decent price brand new from a running stroller.com--DO NOT EVER PURCHASE A STROLLER FROM THIS WEBSITE. It was promised to arrive in 5 days and took 3 weeks. The customer service was horrible, PHONE CALLS WERE NEVER RETURNED and emailed responses took at least 2 days.<br />
<br />
All in all BOB strollers are awesome, but you need to be patient and wait for the right time to buy one at a local store (usually around november when they're trying to get rid of their current years model in order to make room for the new years.)</p>

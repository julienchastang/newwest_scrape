							If we were better people, we’d be too busy reading <i>The Economist</i> or <i>The New York Review of Books</i> to care that Boulder’s big Hollywood moment will arrive this weekend. But, let’s face it, we’re not immune to the charms of the famous, and we shouldn’t feel bad about that, because neither is the institution that is supposed to keep us thinking highbrow, literary thoughts: the Boulder Public Library.  From Sunday, July 24 to Saturday, July 30, the main branch of the Boulder Public library will <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulder.lib.co.us/general/parking.html" title="yield the bulk of its parking lot">yield the bulk of its parking lot</a> to the Hollywood film crew shooting scenes for the Jennifer Garner vehicle <i>Catch And Release</i>.  A rather giddy FAQ that the library has been issuing to patrons explains that “Because of new revenues the film is expected to generate the film company is not paying for the use of the parking lots, however, the film company is making a donation to the library!"  Get a hold of yourself, Boulder Public Library—that exclamation point only makes you seem desperate.  It certainly sounds like the Boulder Public Library is smitten with a certain fetching Mrs. Affleck.<br />
<br />
According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0395495/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8dHQ9MXxmYj11fHBuPTB8cT1jYXRjaCBhbmQgcmVsZWFzZXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=1;ft=9" title="IMDB">IMDB</a>, <i>Catch And Release</i> concerns a young, hot widow (Garner) who “struggles to accept the death of her husband and the secrets he kept from her as she rebuilds her life." Odds are that the deceased was hot, too.  The film also apparently also features “Maureen," played by Juliette Lewis, “Sam" played by Kevin Smith, and “Boulder, Colorado," played by Vancouver, British Columbia.  With the bulk of the filming happily completed in bargain Canada, the crew will be in Boulder for a week to film a few shots that will give the movie that Boulder-y fresh look.<br />
<br />
All this movie business has Boulder hearts a-flutter. One man I spoke to—who wished to remain anonymous for reasons known only to him—claimed that some movie people asked if they could use his downtown office to allow Jennifer Garner to nap between shooting scenes. Others speculated about whether the fact that Garner is currently pregnant with Ben Affleck’s baby and will be spending some time during the baby’s gestation in our fair state will mean that the baby is something of a Coloradoan?  We’ll have to ask <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tancredo.org" title="Tom Tancredo">Tom Tancredo</a> about that one.  And still others wonder where the best places to spot a star might be--NoBo?  Frasca?  I don’t know--I have a feeling that the safest bet might be waiting for Juliette Lewis to stumble into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesundownsaloon.com/" title="The Downer">The Downer</a> one night.

		<p>Why the apologia, Jenny?  Obviously, this thoughtful and important discussion of economic outsourcing in the film industry, and about the proper role of our cultural non-profit institutions and public spaces, is very welcome in these pages!<br />
<br />
Is it too much to hope that you will be blogging from the scene?</p>

							Angela Ashby and Kimberly Hornsby recently released <a href="http://www.adventurepassports.com/" title="Passport to Ski Areas of Colorado">Passport to Ski Areas of Colorado</a>, the latest in their series of Colorado "passports" that allow outdoor enthusiasts to record their conquests of area ski resorts and peaks. The duo's first two passports—<i>Adventure Passport for the 14ers of Colorado</i> and another one for the 13,000 footers—have proved enormously popular, flying off the shelves of such retailers as the Boulder Book Store, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon.com. The booklets provide space for users to detail their adventures, including spaces for the date, weather, trail conditions, and general memories of the journey. The passports seem to provide a perfectly benign, fun way to keep track of hikes and ski trips, but although their website enjoins users to "recreate responsibly," I wonder if these booklets might encourage some gung-ho hikers to summit at any cost.<br />
<br />
Growing up in Denver in the '80s and '90s, I didn't know anyone who treated forays into nature as a way to prove one's physical superiority.  No one looked down on you for "car camping" instead of packing your way into the back country, and don't remember hearing anyone boast about how many peaks they'd summited that summer.  As I understood it, the competitive instinct was reserved for sports like football, basketball, tennis, track, and other games in which a score is kept or a time recorded.  Outdoor recreation was strictly a leisure activity—sure, maybe you'd go on a longer, tougher hike one day than another, but you didn't feel you had to reach the top of the mountain at all costs.  <br />
<br />
When I moved to Boulder for grad school, one of the many puzzling aspects of Boulderites' behavior to me was their tendency to turn what I considered laid-back sports (such as hiking and cycling) into extremely competitive endeavors that demanded specialized equipment and extensive training.  This was especially confusing to me because most of the people acting like this were grown-ups who were not professionals in their chosen sports.  Of course, Boulder has its share of professionals interspersed among the amateurs: I once met a man briefly when I was out with a mountain-oriented friend, and later recognized him on a PBS documentary about climbing Mt. Everest.  Perhaps the close proximity of pros like this stokes the weekend warriors into setting strenuous goals for themselves, such as summiting every fourteener in Colorado.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad goal, and it's certainly more healthy than a goal of, say, watching every <i>Star Wars</i> movie back-to-back in one session, but I wonder if missions like this ever drive people toward risky behavior.  There are always several cases of hikers who go missing each season, and in many instances during this past summer, the missing hikers started out with a partner, but became lost after one of the pair felt too exhausted to make it to the summit and the other of the pair decided to press on.  <br />
<br />
Ashby and Hornsby's latest guide to ski resorts doesn't seem to encourage competitive behavior; all you need to do to fill the booklet out is merely visit each ski resort. Once you're there, you can ski greens all day if you want.  But the duo and some friends have started a new blog on the <a href="http://www.coloradoski.com" title="Colorado Ski Country">Colorado Ski Country</a> website in which they will fill out the passport at a breakneck pace. According to the rules they've set for themselves, "All 25 resorts must be skied in the 2005-2006 season, despite the fact that the blogging team holds down nine-to-five jobs and is bootstrapping travel costs."<br />
<br />
Sheesh.  That <i>Star Wars</i> marathon doesn't sound so bad after all.<br />

		<p>Good story. But don't think competitive outdoors-i-ness was invented only recently. I lived in Jackson Hole in the 70s and the memory of what was expected on rivers and trails back then still has me reaching for the Advil.</p>

		<p>Ironically, Jenny Shank and I have identical viewpoints on recreation in Colorado. However, instead of commenting on our "Passport", she chose to comment on our marketing campaign. Our "race" to ski all 25 Colorado resorts is a public relations campain designed for a product in its infancy, intended to get the word out to both resorts and the public. The Passport is about love of the outdoors. I am a 41 year old exhausted corporate employee, who lives the week dreaming of Ed Visteurs style weekends. I proudly car camp, and have climbed a whopping 5 14ers. Refusing to let my dreams (and memories) fade, I created the Passport for 2 reasons. Inspiration and giving back. It allows all of us - creators and customers - to support all those organizations who maintain trails and clean up after all of us weekend warriors are back at the office. That is what its entirely about.</p>

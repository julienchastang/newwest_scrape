		<h1>Peter Hessler&#8217;s Take on Life in Southern Colorado</h1>

							<p>After reporting on the AWP Conference for a couple of weeks, I have accumulated a lot of odds and ends for this week&#8217;s Roundup.&nbsp; Shall we dive in?

<p>
&#8226; Peter Hessler, the China correspondent for The New Yorker, has a delightful account of his one-year move to rural Colorado in the April 19 issue.&nbsp; After living in China since 1996, Hessler and his wife Leslie decided to move home to the United States for a year to work on book projects.&nbsp; They chose, almost at random, to make their new home in Colorado.&nbsp; Hessler writes in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/19/100419fa_fact_hessler" title=""Go West: Scenes from an American Homecoming"">&#8220;Go West: Scenes from an American Homecoming&#8221;</a>:

<p>
&#8220;I liked the big bright landscapes, the way the mountains caught the alpenglow in late afternoon, and I liked the heavy-named towns that sat in the valleys: Granite, Bedrock, Sawpit, Crested Butte.&nbsp; In southwestern Colorado, we followed the Uncompahgre River for miles; just seeing that name on a sign made me happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Hessler and his wife rent a house in Ridgway for one year, and throw themselves into the life of the town, attending rodeos and high school football games.&nbsp; (If you haven&#8217;t read Hessler&#8217;s <I>River Town</I> or other books, you are missing out.&nbsp; Reading Hessler&#8217;s inquisitive and insightful writing helped me understand a lot more of what I was witnessing when I traveled to China several years ago.)

&#8226; I recently reviewed Louisville, Colo.-based author Adriana Lisboa&#8217;s elegant novel, &#8220;Symphony in White,&#8221; for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/books/ci_14847409" title="the Boulder Daily Camera">the Boulder Daily Camera</a>.&nbsp; Lisboa grew up in Brazil.&nbsp; Her novel won the Jos&#233; Saramago Prize in 2003, and it has just been released in an English edition, translated from the Portuguese by Sarah Green.

		<p>I agree,  Peter  Hessler's article in the New Yorker was great,so much so that I was compelled to read it aloud to my husband. He is a very funny and insightful author,who makes his stories come alive. I can't wait to read his new book,Country Driving.I have given my copy of River Town to many,and all have enjoyed it. I have travelled to many countries,but have never been to China. I  feel like I have,though,thanks to Hessler.</p>

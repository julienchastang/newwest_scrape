							<p>Happy New Year, everyone.&nbsp; Now back to work, right?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve got a backlog of Western book news to share today, so here we go: 
</p>
<p>
&#8226; A few weeks ago, the <a target="_blank" href="  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/us/12montana.html?_r=3&amp;ref=books" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> discussed the Montana writer Annick Smith&#8217;s efforts to block &#8220;Imperial Oil, a Canadian subsidiary of ExxonMobil&#8221; from moving &#8220;its oversize oil-processing equipment from a port in Idaho to Canada, along a path that includes some of the nation&#8217;s most scenic highways.&#8221;  Other writers are joining the fight&#8212;David James Duncan and Rick Bass have written a book, <I>The Heart of the Monster</I>, and the proceeds will go to a group called All Against the Haul.&nbsp; (Steve Bunk summarized the court battle over megaloads on Highway 12 recently for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/megaloads_court_battle_looks_like_a_close_call/C618/L618/" title="New West">New West</a>.)  My new favorite website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwbooklovers.org/tag/the-heart-of-the-monster/" title="Northwest Book Lovers">Northwest Book Lovers</a>, recently caught up with Bass and Duncan to discuss the project. Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/AllAgainstHaul" title="All Against the Haul's Twitter">All Against the Haul&#8217;s Twitter</a> feed for more information.

&#8226; I was lucky enough to have my essay, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pw.org/content/why_we_write_the_hamandegger" title=""The Ham-and-Egger,"">&#8220;The Ham-and-Egger,&#8221;</a> about the process of writing my forthcoming novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jennyshank.com/the-ringer" title="The Ringer">The Ringer</a></I>, published in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pw.org/content/januaryfebruary_2011" title="January/February issue of Poets &amp; Writers">January/February issue of Poets &amp; Writers</a>, the annual &#8220;Inspiration Issue&#8221; of the magazine.&nbsp; I discovered that I&#8217;m not the only writer from this region featured in the issue&#8212;there is lots of great stuff, including Cathie Beck&#8217;s essay &#8220;The Online Book Launch: Self-Publishing Your Way to a Book Deal.&#8221;  Beck, the author of the memoir <I>Cheap Cabernet: A Friendship</I>, lives in Denver and like me was a Rocky Mountain News book reviewer for many years.&nbsp; This issue of Poets &amp; Writers also mentions The Whitefish Review and Missoula&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.submishmash.com/" title="Submishmash">Submishmash</a>, which provides software that allows electronic submissions.&nbsp; The debut poets roundup features Salt Lake City&#8217;s Shira Dentz,  Missoula&#8217;s Keetje Kuipers, and Denver&#8217;s J. Michael Martinez.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve always said&#8212;you Rocky Mountain writers are very inspiring.

&#8226; Arielle Eckstut and David Henry Sterry will be at the Tattered Cover (LoDo) on January 10 at 7:30 p.m.&nbsp; Eckstut and Sterry are the authors of <I>The Essential Guide to Getting Your Book Published</I>, and they will be presenting a session of Pitchapalooza, which I wrote about a few months ago in my report on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/booksellers_tell_writers_like_it_is_at_new_conference/C39/L39/" title="Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association Writers' Conference">Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association Writers&#8217; Conference</a>.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re an aspiring author who has written a book and you want to figure out how to sell the darn thing, I highly recommend you attend.&nbsp; Aileen Jacobson recently wrote for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/nyregion/12artsli.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> about Eckstut and Sterry&#8217;s Pitchapalooza session in Huntington, New York.

		<p>Way to go All Against the Haul! It would be wonderful to have the energy and support of progressives in Missoula and Bozeman on board in the fight against NorthWestern Energy's Mountain States Transmission Intertie (MSTI), an equally environmentally dangerous boondoggle, land grab, etc. Please visit <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fkeepitrural.net%2F">http://keepitrural.net/</a> and <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.concernedcitizensmontana.net%2F">http://www.concernedcitizensmontana.net/</a> to learn more.</p>

		<h1>Harvard Longevity Study Finds Colorado Methuselahs</h1>

							Bill Scanlon reported in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4985878,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> yesterday about a new Harvard longevity study that "puts seven high-county Colorado counties in the top 10 in the nation, with an average lifespan of 81.3 years."  The title of longest-lived county in the U.S. is shared by Clear Creek, Eagle, Gilpin, Grand, Jackson, Park, and Summit counties (as well as two counties in Iowa and one in Maryland).  Besides the top seven slots, Colorado boasts nine other slots in the top fifty.  <br />
<br />
The study, entitled <a target="_blank" href="http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:icGNZ0dbBLcJ:www.globalhealth.harvard.edu/documents/MurrayAmJPrevMed2005.pdf+Eight+Americas:+Investigating+Mortality+Disparities+Across+Races,+Counties+and+Race-Counties+in+the+United+States&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1&client=firefox-a" title=""Eight Americas: Investigating Mortality Disparities Across Races, Counties and Race-Counties in the United States," ">"Eight Americas: Investigating Mortality Disparities Across Races, Counties and Race-Counties in the United States," </a>found significant differences in lifespan among Americans of different races, with chronic disease being the lead cause of early mortality.  This suggests that there's a lot of clean living folk in these rural and mountain counties in Colorado, but that begs the question, why Colorado and why not Utah?  All those (herbal) tea-totaling Mormons surely are in fine health.  Maybe it's the altitude.  Scanlon interviewed several residents of the longest-lived counties and Colorado's chief medical officer and they attributed their longevity to hard work, a low smoking rate, a low obesity rate, and an active lifestyle.

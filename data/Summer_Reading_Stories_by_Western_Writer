		<h1>Summer Reading: Stories by Western Writers in The Atlantic and The New Yorker</h1>

							<p>	This week fans of short stories with Western settings are in luck.&nbsp; The New Yorker published a story by a young New Mexico writer, Kirstin Valdez Quade, in its July 27 issue, and the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908" title="summer fiction issue of the Atlantic Monthly">summer fiction issue of the Atlantic Monthly</a> is out now.&nbsp; The Atlantic has always featured plenty of fiction by Western writers, and this issue is no exception, with stories by Montana&#8217;s Rick Bass, Ouray, Colo.-based Kent Nelson, and Oregon State University teacher <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908/harrison-least-resistance" title="Wayne Harrison">Wayne Harrison</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoyed all the stories, but Kirstin Valdez Quade&#8217;s &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2009/07/27/090727fi_fiction_quade" title="The Five Wounds">The Five Wounds</a>&#8221; especially stands out for its vivid imagery.&nbsp; In it, a 33-year-old man named Amadeo Padilla is going to portray Jesus in a Good Friday reenactment of Christ&#8217;s passion in a small New Mexico town where this is an annual event.&nbsp; She captures the excitement of the townspeople as they gather to watch Amadeo drag a wooden cross up a hill.&nbsp; She writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is no silky-haired, rosy-cheeked, honey-eyed Jesus, no Jesus-of-the-children, Jesus-with-the-lambs. Amadeo is pockmarked and bad-toothed, hair shaved close to a scalp scarred from fights, roll of skin where skull meets thick neck. You name the sin, he&#8217;s done it: gluttony, sloth, fucked a second cousin on the dark bleachers at the high school.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The story then takes a step back in time, to the prior week, when Amadeo is preparing for his role as Jesus, a role he hopes will redeem him from his going-nowhere life.&nbsp; His hugely pregnant 15-year-old daughter Angel turns up on the doorstep of the house where he lives with his mother.&nbsp; He abandoned Angel when she was a baby, and now he must confront her.&nbsp; The whole thing culminates in a rush of complex emotions, gore, and religious imagery.&nbsp; I loved Valdez Quade&#8217;s hard-bitten, deadpan voice, such as this description of Amadeo&#8217;s mother Yolanda: &#8220;Yolanda still cooks for him, pushes one plate across the table at him and another at whatever man she&#8217;s got with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I look forward to reading more from her in the coming years.&nbsp; I learned from a contributor&#8217;s note in the summer 2008 issue of the <a target="_blank" href="http://coloradoreview.colostate.edu/cr/back.htm" title="Colorado Review">Colorado Review</a>, which published Valdez Quade&#8217;s first story, that she is from northern New Mexico.&nbsp; She graduates from the University of Oregon with an MFA in creative writing this year, and she&#8217;ll be a Wallace Stegner fellow at Stanford from 2009 through 2011.
</p>
<p>
Kent Nelson&#8217;s story &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908/nelson-alba" title="Alba">Alba</a>&#8221; goes along well with Valdez Quade&#8217;s &#8220;The Five Wounds"&#8212;while hers captures the darker side of New Mexico life, including the cycle of teen pregnancy, poverty, and despair, Nelson&#8217;s portrays the positive side with its story of a scrappy, intelligent immigrant named &#218;ltimo Vargas who makes his way from Mexico to Hatch, New Mexico, where his entrepreneurial spirit helps him advance in life.&nbsp; It begins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#218;ltimo Vargas had been in Hatch, New Mexico, only six months, since March, and already he owned his own business to compete with Netflix, delivering DVDs and video games to ranchers and people who lived within 20 miles of town. He had worked out a deal with Se&#241;ora Gaspar, who owned the video store, to pay him 90 percent of the delivery fee, and if he took out more than 50 videos in a week, a premium on the extras.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Even when misfortune strikes, Vargas lands on his feet, eventually parlaying his business savvy and the goodwill he&#8217;s cultivated among the townspeople into an opportunity to become a chile farmer.&nbsp; &#8220;Alba&#8221; reminds me of another great story-- Daniyal Mueenuddin&#8217;s &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2007/08/27/070827fi_fiction_mueenuddin" title="Nawabdin Electrician">Nawabdin Electrician</a>,&#8221; which similarly follows a poor man who works hard enough to raise himself above the poverty of his Pakistani town, also through the aid of a moped.
</p>
<p>
(By the way, what&#8217;s up with talented fiction writers named Kent living in the Salida/Ouray area of Colorado?&nbsp; Kent Haruf lives there too.) 
</p>
<p>
Rick Bass&#8217;s story, &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908/bass-fish" title="Fish Story">Fish Story</a>,&#8221; set in Texas, has that glimmer of evil and disquietude that his Texas stories from his last collection had.&nbsp; The narrator is the son of the owner of a gas station in a rural area west of Fort Worth.&nbsp; A poor man who owes his dad $67 for gas gives the narrator&#8217;s dad a huge catfish in lieu of payment, and the boy is told to keep the fish wet and alive until it&#8217;s time for a big fish fry his father is hosting that evening.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not such an easy task, as the fish has an ominous air:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;All day long that Friday&#8212;in late August, school had not yet started&#8212;I knelt beside the gasping fish and kept it hosed down with a trickle of cool water, giving the fish life one silver gasp at a time, keeping its gills and its slick gray skin wet: the steady trickling of that hose, and nothing else, helping it stay alive. We had no tub large enough to hold the fish, and so I squatted beside it in the dust, resting on my heels, and studied it as I moved the silver stream of water up and down its back.
</p>
<p>
The fish, in turn, studied me with its round, obsidian eyes, which had a gold lining to their perimeter, like pyrite. The fish panted and watched me while the heat built all around us, rising steadily through the day from the fields, giving birth in the summer-blue sky to towering white cumulus clouds.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
To make it worse, the boy is beset by the teenage son and the drunken wife of the man who caught the fish, who try to take it away.&nbsp; There&#8217;s some striking, creepy imagery throughout the story, particularly at the end when the drunken woman returns and dances with the fish&#8217;s cast-off skin.&nbsp; I really loved Rick Bass&#8217;s most recent nonfiction book, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/dad_in_the_woods_rick_basss_the_wild_marsh/C39/L39/" title="The Wild Marsh">The Wild Marsh</a></I>, but this story reminds me why I prefer his fiction above all the other things he writes.
</p>
<p>
Harrison&#8217;s story &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200908/harrison-least-resistance" title="Least Resistance">Least Resistance</a>&#8221; is the only one of the four not set in the West--it&#8217;s set in an auto mechanic&#8217;s shop in Waterbury, Connecticut, though Oregon does have a cameo role, as a clean, well-lighted place from which the shop&#8217;s owner and his wife have come.&nbsp; A young mechanic-in-training starts up an affair with the wife of the shop owner, and notices pictures of Oregon on their home&#8217;s walls:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Rolling waves were framed by miles of Sahara-like dunes. A lake inside a dead volcano, white mountain peaks, lava fields that looked like the face of the moon. Nick and Mary Ann came out East when Nick inherited the shop from an uncle who had died of emphysema. I imagined that arriving here, in run-down Waterbury, from such a place as Oregon, must&#8217;ve been like waking from a dream.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
And I have one book event to report this week: the 25th Annual Rocky Mountain Book and Paper Fair will be held at the Denver Merchandise Mart on Friday, July 31, (5 p.m.-9 p.m.) and Saturday, August 1 (10 a.m.-5 p.m.).

		<p>it's CHILE not chili<br />
here in New Mexico.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-30-09</b>
		<p>Hi Susan,<br />
<br />
Yes, you're right!  And the author had it spelled in the conventional New Mexico fashion in his story, so I've changed it above.</p>

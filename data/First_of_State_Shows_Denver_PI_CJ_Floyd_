</p>
<p>
<I>First of State</I> is the eighth book in the CJ Floyd series, but chronologically it&#8217;s a prequel to the other books, beginning when Floyd is a young man returning to Denver in 1971 after serving in Vietnam.&nbsp; Fighting flashbacks and nightmares, Floyd comes home to live with the man who raised him, his uncle Ike, who is &#8220;the first black bailbondsman on the city&#8217;s notorious Bail Bondsman&#8217;s Row.&#8221;  Although CJ would rather kick around in antique stores and revisit his favorite past haunts in Five Points, the historically black neighborhood in northeast Denver, Ike is faltering physically, and he&#8217;s determined to train CJ to take over the family business.
</p>
<p>
	As the book opens, CJ bonds at an antique shop with World War II Veteran Wiley Ames over their mutual appreciation of vintage license plates.&nbsp; Shortly after CJ meets Ames, he and a Chinese musician named Quan Lee Chin are murdered, and CJ determines to figure out who did it.&nbsp; There are few leads, as Chin and Ames didn&#8217;t have many friends or relatives interested in seeking justice for them.&nbsp; But CJ feels a responsibility to Ames as a fellow veteran, and he never stops working on the case, no matter how many times the trail runs cold.&nbsp; <I>First of State</I> spans the six years CJ spends unraveling the mystery, while learning the trade of being a bailbondsman and solving a couple of other murder cases along the way.
</p>
<p>
	Shortly after Wiley&#8217;s murder, Ike&#8217;s girlfriend&#8217;s son is murdered, and CJ quickly gets to the bottom of that case in part because it&#8217;s an inside Five Points job.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easier for CJ to connect the dots between the murdered man and his murderer when all the relationships he needs to investigate are confined to this neighborhood that he knows well.&nbsp; In the case of Wiley&#8217;s death, however, CJ must leave his comfort zone and visit Wiley&#8217;s hostile niece in Sterling, Colorado and track down Chin&#8217;s associate who plays for the Denver Symphony Orchestra, among other forays.
</p>
<p>
	<I>First of State</I> will especially appeal to readers who live in Denver or know it well.&nbsp; I enjoyed reading <I>First of State</I> in part because I went to school in Five Points in the early &#8216;90s when the neighborhood was riddled with gang violence.&nbsp; Greer carries readers back to a Five Points that was rough, but not wrecked, a neighborhood in which everyone knew each other, and people looked out for one another.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t get enough of scenes like this one, in which CJ visits &#8220;Nobby&#8217;s, a Welton Street restaurant, bar, and pool hall&#8221;:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;Across the room [CJ] could see that Leander Moultry, longtime Five Points pool shark and hustler, was in what Ike would have described as a cesspool of trouble again&#8230;This time Leander had beaten flashy-dressing, slow-thinking Billy Larkin at five straight games of eight ball and taken him for a thousand dollars; then, gloatingly squeezing his testicles in typical 1971, in-your-face, baddest-brother in-the-&#8217;hood fashion, he&#8217;d called Billy a jelly-headed, sissified, tit-sucking mamma&#8217;s boy.&nbsp; Leander was in trouble, all right.&nbsp; Trouble enough to threaten the five-foot-six, bird-faced little pool hustler&#8217;s life.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Squeezing another man&#8217;s testicles was a &#8220;typical&#8221; form of gloating in 1971?&nbsp; Calling someone &#8220;jelly-headed&#8221; was a prime insult?&nbsp; Tell me more.&nbsp; Scenes like these, in which Greer visits bars, soul-food restaurants, antique shops, or flea markets and brings them to life with a full cast of characters are the strength of <I>First of State</I>.&nbsp; As in this passage, Greer occasionally piles up so many adjectives and adverbs in one sentence that a reader can trip over them, or he reiterates similar descriptive terms several times in the space of a few pages, but at least they&#8217;re interesting adjectives and adverbs.
</p>
<p>
Greer&#8217;s characters&#8212;such as fetching Mavis, a Boston college business student being groomed to take over her father&#8217;s many Five Points businesses, and CJ&#8217;s best buddy Roosevelt &#8220;Rosie&#8221; Weeks, a strapping man who runs an independent gas station and garage&#8212;are unique and complicated.&nbsp; Many dozens of these characters make appearances in <I>First of State</I>, and leave before the reader is ready to part company with them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a good thing for readers like me who are new to the CJ Floyd series that there are seven more books in which to read up on their exploits, and <I>First of State</I> is an excellent place to start.

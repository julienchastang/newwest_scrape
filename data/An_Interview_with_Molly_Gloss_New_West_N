							<p><I>Portland novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mollygloss.com/" title="Molly Gloss">Molly Gloss</a>&#8216;s new book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mollygloss.com/hearts.html" title="The Hearts of Horses">The Hearts of Horses</a>, is the affecting yet unsentimental story of a young woman named Martha Lessing who rides into the Oregon countryside during World War I.&nbsp; She begins to train a group of ranchers&#8217; horses in her careful, gentle way on a &#8220;circle ride&#8221; that brings her regularly to each neighbor&#8217;s home.&nbsp; I recently spoke to Molly Gloss about her new novel, publishers&#8217; biases against the West, her other career as a science fiction writer, how her husband&#8217;s death from cancer affected her writing, and how the book&#8217;s ending honors him. Gloss will discuss her novel in Portland on November 27 (Broadway Books, 7 p.m.) and 29 (Annie Bloom&#8217;s Books, 7:30 p.m.).</I>
</p>
<p>
<b>New West:&nbsp; How did you come up with the large cast of characters in <I>The Hearts of Horses</I>?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Molly Gloss:</b>  Well, I knew I wanted to send Martha on this circle ride, and that there would be a cast of characters that she would encounter, and I just did a lot of thinking about that and making notes.&nbsp; Also, early on, I reread <I>Black Beauty</I> because I thought I would have Martha reading it, and Beauty encounters quite a cast of characters in his story.&nbsp; There were some characters that he encountered that had personality profiles that I could make use of.&nbsp; So some of those people probably come from <I>Black Beauty</I>--I&#8217;m not really sure which ones.&nbsp; I guess probably the Romers, the alcoholic husband.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been at least five years since I&#8217;ve read the book, but I would say some of the broad outlines of their story at least a few of the characters came from <I>Black Beauty</I>.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; How did you create Elwha County, the fictional county in which the book takes place?</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I originally thought I would set the novel in Wallowa County, which is in the far northeastern corner of Oregon and is a beautiful place.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t want to be stuck with the real history of Wallow County, with the particular events that happened there.&nbsp; And Wallowa County is bigger than Elwha County, and I didn&#8217;t think I wanted to have to deal with a canvas that large.&nbsp; So that&#8217;s why I decided to create a fictional county, but I used a shrunk-down version of Wallowa County as the model for it, and I just shoved aside some other counties in Oregon and plopped down Elwha where I wanted it to be, south of Pendleton and north of John Day, and pushed other things aside to make room for it there.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; So you envisioned the geography, and then you must have taken things from Oregon history that you wanted to include? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Pretty much I envisioned the geography of Wallowa County, but on a smaller scale, because it has mountains on two sides and a valley down the middle and little towns down the middle.&nbsp; And the history things, I made use of what I knew had in fact happened in Oregon and in the West in 1917.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; You mentioned Martha&#8217;s favorite book <I>Black Beauty</I>, and in your essay &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.powells.com/essays/gloss.html" title="Desperado">Desperado</a>&#8221; you wrote that you also &#8220;had a thing for horse books&#8221; growing up.&nbsp; What other horse book were your favorites? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> I did read <I>Black Beauty</I> and <I>The Black Stallion</I>, that whole series that [Walter Farley] wrote.&nbsp; I can even remember the plots of a couple of them, but I can&#8217;t remember the titles.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; I used to like that series that included <I>Misty of Chincoteague</I> and <I>Stormy, Misty&#8217;s Foal</I>, with the big picture of the horse&#8217;s face on the cover.</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Oh sure, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Henry" title="Marguerite Henry">Marguerite Henry</a>.&nbsp; Absolutely--I still have one of those books, Marguerite Henry&#8217;s <I>Album of Horses</I>.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a large format book about different horse breeds, and each breed has a page of text and a full-page painting that she did of that horse and its environment.&nbsp; I read and reread that book.&nbsp; Oh gosh, the pages are practically worn thin.&nbsp; And I still have it.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Did your renewed interest in horses come about from writing <I>The Hearts of Horses</I> or did your interest in horses prompt the writing of the book? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I think probably the former.&nbsp; I had grown up with horses when I was a kid.&nbsp; I never owned one but I was around them a lot when I was young.&nbsp; But I hadn&#8217;t been around them for probably twenty or twenty-five years when I began to think about writing this book.&nbsp; As soon as I got serious about writing, I went out and got reacquainted, so I guess it was the writing itself that prompted me to get reacquainted.&nbsp; But now that I&#8217;m done with the book, the bug has hit, and I&#8217;m still riding every week and hanging out with horses.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Do you think you&#8217;ll write more horse books? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still stuck on them and around them a lot.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if the focus will be on horses so much as it is with this book, but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d write a book that didn&#8217;t have horses in it.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW: Many of the main characters in your novels have been readers, as Martha is, or writers, as the protagonist of <I>Wild Life</I> is.&nbsp; Why do put that quality into your characters? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Well, to write about writers is a natural thing that a lot of writers do as a way to procreate aspects of their life that they&#8217;re familiar with in their work.&nbsp; So in <I>Wild Life</I>, writing about a writer was a natural thing to do.&nbsp; Readers--I guess I don&#8217;t mean it to be didactic, but I do like to show those characters as models, people who read.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a tendency to think people in the rural West aren&#8217;t readers, and I think that&#8217;s very wrong.&nbsp; There are perhaps more people reading in the rural West than in the cities, at least now.&nbsp; So I think it&#8217;s just an honest thing to do, to portray people as readers, and I suppose there&#8217;s the added benefit that you hope your book will be read by people who like to read, and they&#8217;re going to see some aspect of themselves in a character that likes to read.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Do you see your idea that people don&#8217;t perceive Westerners as readers reflected in the publishing industry in what they are willing to print?</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Absolutely.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the short answer.&nbsp; The publishing industry is mostly focused in the East, and it&#8217;s always been a problem for Western writers to attract the attention of eastern publishers.&nbsp; Western writers have long complained about that.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t really complain about [my publisher] Houghton Mifflin, because their backlist, their focus for decades and decades has been the work of western writers.&nbsp; They were the publisher of A.B. Guthrie, Jr., and Willa Cather.&nbsp; They have a really strong women&#8217;s West backlist.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re not in New York, they&#8217;re up in Boston.&nbsp; But I think there is a tendency among New York publishers to think not only that there aren&#8217;t as many readers in the West but that the books that they should publish should focus on the East because they think that&#8217;s where their readers are.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; There might be a saturation of eastern-focused books, though.</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Well, I know as a reader that I&#8217;m not very attracted to urban dysfunctional fiction.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just not.&nbsp; And I think there are probably a lot of readers like that.&nbsp; That kind of fiction often has not much story involved in it, and I think there&#8217;s a great yearning among us all for novels that have story.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Martha has some of the qualities of a typical Western hero, such as her desire to wander and be outside and be unhindered, but she seems to be thrust into a nurturing role a lot of times, to help the sick and injured or chat with socially-isolated ranch wives.&nbsp; When you were writing this, did you find that you couldn&#8217;t make a woman who was totally free of women&#8217;s roles during this time period? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I guess I didn&#8217;t think of it quite that way.&nbsp; I thought of Martha as somebody a lot like I was when I was nineteen.&nbsp; When I was nineteen I was caught up in wishing that I was a cowboy.&nbsp; Now at this age, and knowing as much as I do about the destructive side and the dark side of the cowboy hero, I wanted to write a novel in which a young woman like that comes to realize that there are other kinds of heroism, and maybe what Shane should have done instead of killing the bad guys and then riding out of the valley, maybe he should have hung around and become part of the community.&nbsp; That was something that I wanted Martha to begin to realize.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t deliberately thinking at all in terms of her feminine side.&nbsp; It was more that she was coming to realize that settling into a community can be the bravest thing a cowboy can do.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; The dialogue of the characters is precise and unique and it immediately put me into the historical setting.&nbsp; How did you accomplish that?</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I guess some of it&#8217;s instinct.&nbsp; Some of it&#8217;s that my dad was Texan and I grew up hearing certain types of syntax and turns of phrase that come from his childhood in Texas.&nbsp; A lot of it comes from my reading of fiction that was written around that time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my usual pattern of research early on, when I&#8217;m writing historical fiction, is to read the novels that were written during that time.&nbsp; So I read a number of novels that were published in the 1910s.&nbsp; In that way you get a sense of the syntax, the way people talked, the way they organized their sentences.&nbsp; The vocabulary comes through in those novels.&nbsp; The way you write fiction has changed over the decades, because modern writers use modern syntax and writers from the 1910s write the way people talked then.&nbsp; So I just sort of absorbed that--it seeps into me and then it can come out on the page when I&#8217;m writing.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; You&#8217;ve written and spoken about your love of western genre novels when you were growing up.&nbsp; It seems that western genre novels are disappearing, but that western literary novels are thriving.&nbsp; Do you agree with that, and if so, how do you account for that? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I do agree with it.&nbsp; There was a period of time when the only western fiction being published was pretty much by Louis L&#8217;Amour.&nbsp; I guess there&#8217;s others being published now, but what I most often see on racks in the supermarket and places like that are the sort of soft porn Westerns, the Longarm series and that sort of thing which are all about grotesque violence, violence against women and overt sexuality and really soft porn in a western disguise.&nbsp; I think that in some ways that trend in western fiction has destroyed the market for genre westerns, such as cowboy novels.&nbsp; I also think that the reader for that kind of a novel has gotten older and that whole generation of people who read those kinds of books is dying off, and nobody is publishing them because there&#8217;s not much of a market for people to read them.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, people like me who grew up reading them and then went on to read the better western literature&#8212;Guthrie and Mari Sandoz and Willa Cather, and <I>The Ox-Bow Incident</I> and all the great novels of the West.&nbsp; Those of us who grew up on that literature, if we&#8217;re still writing about the West, we&#8217;re trying to write along that model, the western literature model, which I think is why that field is kind of thriving right now.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; I read that when you first began writing, you were interested in writing western settings, but the market was dead, so you started to write science fiction.&nbsp; When did the interest in western literature pick up, and do you ever think you&#8217;ll go back to writing science fiction? </b> 
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Well, I wrote <I>The Jump-Off Creek</I> which is a western, in the 1980&#8217;s and it was published in 1989.&nbsp; When I wrote it, there was still a dearth of westerns out there, and I didn&#8217;t think it would ever get published, I didn&#8217;t think my agent would want to handle it.&nbsp; Instead it was well received and Houghton Mifflin took it.&nbsp; I remember in particular my editor writing me a letter that said, &#8220;We&#8217;re planning to publish this as a literary novel--is that okay with you?&#8221;  She recognized it as a western, but she planned to publish it as mainstream fiction.
</p>
<p>
I was very surprised by that and surprised by its reception&#8212;it was a Penn/Faulkner nominee that year.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a really prestigious American fiction prize that doesn&#8217;t usually recognize anything from the West.&nbsp; So I guess I would say from my personal point of view that it began to pick up around then.&nbsp; I felt like at that time when I wrote the book that nobody was writing western literature, even good western literature.&nbsp; I had read it for years but nobody was writing anything new. But in the years since then there have been quite a few.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Cormac McCarthy started writing western books instead of southern books around that time, and Kent Haruf&#8217;s career started taking off.</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  You&#8217;re right, I would say in the last fifteen to twenty years there has been quite an upsurge in fine western novels by really good writers, and it&#8217;s been nice to see.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; I was very moved by your portrait of the Kandels in the book, the family in which the husband is dying of cancer. Was that difficult to write? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> Yeah, pretty hard.&nbsp; I knew from the beginning that I wanted to do that.&nbsp; I wanted to write about somebody who was dying of cancer, a family with a wife and a husband and a child, because I wanted a place in that book for me to write about my personal experience.&nbsp; In part that was because when my husband died of cancer in 2000, I actually felt fairly betrayed by the literature and the films that I had been exposed to over my lifetime that dealt with death and especially death by cancer.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t think I ever read in anybody&#8217;s novel or had ever seen in anybody&#8217;s film an honest portrayal of what that experience might be like.&nbsp; What you see are these sanitized and sweet moments with the person on their death bed, completely coherent and clean, saying their last loving words to their beloved as they&#8217;re clasping hands.&nbsp; And then the moment of death is when the hand loosens and falls away onto the clean bed sheet.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
That was so not my experience--it was not anywhere even remotely like my experience--that I really felt betrayed by it.&nbsp; I wanted to write honestly about what was like, at least what that was like for me.&nbsp; I think that I came close.&nbsp; I was not able to do what I initially wanted to do, because I realized there were things I couldn&#8217;t write about because they would have been a betrayal of my husband.&nbsp; A betrayal of his privacy.&nbsp; It was not as honest a portrait as I initially thought I would do, but it&#8217;s as honest as I can make it and still have it out there for people to see.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; It reminded me of <I>The Year of Magical Thinking</I> by Joan Didion, which is so honest in the same way.</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Although she had a very different experience.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Right, because it was not a prolonged illness.</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  But she wrote scathingly honestly about the grief process.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW: What are you working on now? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> I&#8217;m not working on a long project at the moment.&nbsp; I&#8217;m writing some poems and I did write a short story and I&#8217;m thinking about another one.&nbsp; I have another long project composting in the back of my mind.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW: Have you written poetry before? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> I started writing poetry after my husband died.&nbsp; It was one of the things I tried to do in order to jump start my writing, because I didn&#8217;t write at all for three years after he died.&nbsp; I took up the poetry hoping that that would pull the plug.&nbsp; And it did work that way.&nbsp; I wrote, as you can imagine, lots of poems about love, grief, death.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still writing poems and they&#8217;re not all now about those things.&nbsp; They&#8217;re about all kinds of things, including my cat.&nbsp; I belong to a poetry critique group and we each bring a couple of poems each time we meet, once a month.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m writing two or three poems a month at this rate.&nbsp; I&#8217;m enjoying it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not trying to publish poems at this point--just sort of honing my craft and trying to get better.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW: Is it humbling or invigorating to try a new genre after you&#8217;ve been so successful at another one? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  It is, both of those things.&nbsp; It was scary and hard, and I recognized that I had a pretty steep learning curve, especially at first.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also pushed me to read a lot more poetry.&nbsp; I realized when I began to write it that I had not been reading much poetry and didn&#8217;t have the education in that way that many other writers have had.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Whose poetry have you enjoyed? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> I really like Gregory Orr, his book that is about grief and loss, <I>Concerning the Book that Is the Body of the Beloved</I>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been a fan of some semi-local poets from the Northwest and the West.&nbsp; Charles Goodrich, Dorianne Laux--these are Oregon poets.&nbsp; Judith Barrington I like a lot.&nbsp; Her book is called <I>Horses and the Human Soul</I>, and it&#8217;s got a wonderful poem in it by that title.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; Do you think you might publish a collection of short stories? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  Oddly enough--and this gets back to an earlier question you had--most of my short stories are science fiction.&nbsp; I never have quit writing science fiction; it&#8217;s just that I only write short stories.&nbsp; My long works have been western stories.&nbsp; I have a book-length collection of science fiction short stories, but I&#8217;m not planning to publish it any time soon.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to distract readers from who they think I am.&nbsp; If I came out with a collection of science fiction stories, they&#8217;d probably be baffled by it.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; The heyday of science fiction short story magazines has passed, but are there still good venues that are publishing them? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  There are, interestingly enough, which is why I still write it, because you can still  market it.&nbsp; Asimov&#8217;s Magazine and Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction are still there, and there are a number of online paying markets that publish science fiction.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW: I want to ask a question about the ending of <I>The Hearts of Horses</I>, so this should serve as a spoiler warning for anyone who hasn&#8217;t read it yet.&nbsp; Why did you decide to have Martha get married after all, even though she&#8217;d been set against it? </b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B>  I knew Martha would get married from the get-go.&nbsp; I knew before I even started the book that this book would be, among other things, a romance.&nbsp; That was mostly determined by the fact that I wanted this book to honor my husband, and he was such a sentimentalist.&nbsp; He&#8217;d always complained to me that he wished I would let one of my girls fall in love and get married.&nbsp; So I just set out deliberately to write a book that included that.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But I also knew that I had to be true to my own feelings about that, and that&#8217;s why I wanted to have Martha lay down the rules about what she would and wouldn&#8217;t do if she got married.&nbsp; Also, I had seen that sort of thing in some of the memoirs and journals that I had read of women in the West.&nbsp; Many of them stuck to their guns about that kind of thing&#8212;about &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work outside and I&#8217;m not going to become a stay-at-home housewife.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
We also have sort of a false idea about that.&nbsp; In truth the image we have about women who stayed inside and gave up an exciting outdoor life really is very recent, and dates from the 1950&#8217;s mostly.&nbsp; Before that, it would have been very common for a ranch wife especially to be working outside with her husband and not be relegated to the kitchen.&nbsp; So I didn&#8217;t think I was making her give up her exciting life to be a ranch housewife.
</p>
<p>
<B>NW:&nbsp; And for a book that ends in a marriage, it&#8217;s about as unsentimental as you can get.&nbsp; I love the description of her husband as being &#8220;a long way from handsome.&#8221;</b>
</p>
<p>
<B>MG:</B> Good, I&#8217;m glad.&nbsp; One of the things I worried about with that book was that people would call it sentimental, and I certainly hope I avoided that.
</p>
<p>
<I>Gloss will discuss her novel in Portland on November 27 (Broadway Books, 7 p.m.) and 29 (Annie Bloom&#8217;s Books, 7:30 p.m.).</I>

		<p>Do any Free Reverse Cell Phone Directories exist? <br />
<br />
Many people ask this question when searching for a free reverse cell phone directory online.  However, no such thing exists! A small fee is to be expected if you're looking to receive complete and accurate information. <br />
<br />
You may find some free websites which claim to offer a free reverse trace of a cellphone number, but you'll find most of these will only inform you of the phone's service or the location at which the phone number was issued, never the current owner of that number. <br />
<br />
Why Doesn't A Free Reverse Cell Phone Directory Exist? <br />
<br />
So, the big question is, why isn't there such a thing as a free reverse cell phone directory, especially once people realize one does not exist yet? There do exist, after all, many free reverse lookup directories for traditional land line phone numbers. So why is it different for cell phones? <br />
<br />
Well, the information behind cell phone numbers and land line numbers are classified differently. It's long be true that your home phone number is considered public domain. After all, does the phone book need your permission to list your home phone number? In fact, you often have to pay money simply to keep your number from being listed! <br />
<br />
Cell phone services providers charge for every phone call you receive, it's because of this that the numbers are considered more private. This also makes these numbers harder to trace. <br />
<br />
411 Wireless Directory <br />
<br />
A public reverse cell phone directory was in the talk some years ago. The various cell phone service providers would have placed the numbers of their customers in this directory and it would be publicly available. Concerns over privacy and invasion from telemarketers put a stop to this idea, at least for the time being. <br />
<br />
However this doesn't mean such a directory is impossible. It can, and already has, been done! These directories take a lot of time and effort to organized, they require information from millions of records to be added manually. Such a gargantuan effort simply can't be offered for free. However, even many directories which carry such a fee do not possess a complete database of information. <br />
<br />
However, by far the most complete and accurate reverse cell phone directory is Trace Cell Number. Search Trace Cell Number on Google and you'll soon see it's often touted as the highest ranking reverse cell phone directory available on the internet. <br />

		<p>From what I've heard, their cards compared in price and performance are total trash. The 5850 and the GTX285 are priced the same. However, the 5850 supports DX11 and it doubles the performance of the GTX285. I think Nvidia is based on greed with little to no real quality in their products. I've also heard that Nvidia is having a lot of trouble in their fabrication process. They are just not producing working chips at all. It's like their scientists are at their limit in terms of innovation. Nvidia's business troops are probably their only strong points. Going around and making deals building up a name for them in the PC business but with little to no actual future. But, I'm not sure exactly what the TRUE story is. So far I've read from fanboys on either sides. I've checked it out though, turns out that someone has done the math and Nvidia's failure to produce a heavy hitter to counter ATI is because they just can't and probably won't be able to any time soon. What's your verdict?<br />

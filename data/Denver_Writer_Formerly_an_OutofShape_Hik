							<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_13775893" title="The Denver Post reported">The Denver Post reported</a> this weekend that Denver writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.markobmascik.com" title="Mark Obmascik">Mark Obmascik</a>&#8216;s <I>Halfway to Heaven: My White Knuckled and Knuckleheaded-Quest for the Rocky Mountain High</I> won this year&#8217;s outdoor literature prize from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.noba-web.org/books09.htm" title="National Outdoor Book Awards Foundation">National Outdoor Book Awards Foundation</a>: &#8220;The book is about climbing Colorado&#8217;s 14,000-plus foot mountains, all 54 of them, in one summer. The problem, though, as Obmascik points out in this humorous work, is that he&#8217;s completely out of shape.&#8221;  Obmasik was the lead writer for the Denver Post team that won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Columbine shootings. He will discuss his book at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.markobmascik.com/events" title="REI in Boulder">REI in Boulder</a> on November 30 (7 p.m.).

&#8226; John Jurgensen&#8217;s insightful<a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704576204574529703577274572.html" title=" interview with Cormac McCarthy"> interview with Cormac McCarthy</a> ran in the Wall Street Journal last week in advance of the opening of the film version of <I>The Road</I>.&nbsp; Their discussion ranges all over the place in subject matter, from the movie versions of McCarthy&#8217;s films, to fatherhood, to his writing process.&nbsp; Jurgensen writes,  &#8220;McCarthy shuns interviews, but he relishes conversation.&#8221;  One subject that McCarthy cycles back to several times is the apocalypse, something that he frequently discusses with his friends at the Santa Fe Institute.&nbsp; One highlight: Jurgensen asked McCarthy why he ended up in the Southwest, and McCarthy replied:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I ended up in the Southwest because I knew that nobody had ever written about it. Besides Coca-Cola, the other thing that is universally known is cowboys and Indians. You can go to a mountain village in Mongolia and they&#8217;ll know about cowboys. But nobody had taken it seriously, not in 200 years. I thought, here&#8217;s a good subject. And it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The whole interview offers some insights into the philosophy and working process of the great novelist.

							Four three years, <a href="http://www.tarantellamusic.com" title="Tarantella">Tarantella</a>â€™s only recorded output was a four-track 2002 demo (<a href="http://smoochrecords.com/bands/tarantella.html" title=""Extra Fine Macaroni Gragnano Style"">"Extra Fine Macaroni Gragnano Style"</a>) and a song on the second volume of the <i>Radio 1190 Local Shakedown</i> compilation. These early recordings piqued the interest of fans of Denverâ€™s Western-gothic music scene (whose loosely-affiliated members have included 16 Horsepower, The Kalamath Brothers, The Denver Gentlemen, Woven Hand, Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots, and others).  Last month, Tarantella finally released its debut full-length <i>Esqueletos</i> (<a href="http://www.alternativetentacles.com/" title="Alternative Tentacles Records">Alternative Tentacles Records</a>), an album that is distinguished by frontwoman Kal Cahooneâ€™s haunting, mournful vocals and multi-instrumentatlist John Rumleyâ€™s languid, surprising compositions.<br />
<br />
Tarantellaâ€”named for an Italian folk dance which was an imitation of the agonized hopping that was characteristic of tarantula-bite victimsâ€”plumbs the folk music traditions of Latin America and the Western U.S. on <i>EsquelÃ©tos</i>.  The band began as a collaboration between Calhoone and Rumley, and later incorporated violinist Kelly Oâ€™Dea, bassist Shane Trost, drummer Chad Johnson, and guitarist Bob Febrache (best known as the recording engineer behind Absinthe Studios, the hotbed of Denver music activity that has produced albums by 16 Horsepower, Slim Cessnaâ€™s Auto Club, DeVotchKa, and many others).<br />
<br />
Sounding world-weary as she sings in Spanish and English, Kal Calhoone brings to mind La Llorona, the weeping woman of Mexican and Mexican-American folklore, a lovelorn, morbid figure.  On the title track, Calhoone sings of â€œnuestros esqueletos de amor/ que bailan sobre las piedrasâ€? (â€œOur skeletons of love/ that dance over the stonesâ€?) and most of the songs contain similarly fraught declarations of love with dark overtones provided by Calhooneâ€™s tortured voice.  <br />
<br />
The album is consistent in its Edward Gorey-meets-Zane Grey mood, yet varied in its evocation. â€œDark Horse,â€? a fiddle and accordion confection, is jaunty enough to serve in a vaudevillian act. â€œSouthern Crossâ€? features drawn-out violin strains and ringing organ chords that create a woozy, ominous atmosphere. â€œMisa Gringaâ€? is a twangy Western set in the Northeastern Colorado plains that could have fit right in on the soundtrack to <i>Gunsmoke</i> were it not for Calhooneâ€™s delightfully unhinged vocals and the bouncy blasts of what sounds like a didgeridoo.  â€œOh have you seen the Pawnee Buttes/ And the cemetery there?â€? Calhoone asks, managing to find a dark cloud even in lands (such as the Pawnee Grasslands) that boast the bluest skies.  <br />
<br />
Tarantella has never toured and doesnâ€™t play many live shows because its members split time with other projects (such as Wovenhand, Polytoxic, and Bad Luck City), but the release of <i>EsquelÃ©tos</i> should finally bring the bandâ€™s odd, compelling brand of Western noir to more listeners.

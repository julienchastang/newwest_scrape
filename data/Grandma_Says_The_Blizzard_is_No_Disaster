							As the snow continued to fall last night, Colorado Governor Bill Owens declared a statewide disaster emergency.  Although this is a bureaucratic designation designed to make resources available, the phrase "disaster emergency" couldn't be further from what those of us who are safe inside with plenty of food and roofs that are holding up (for the moment) are experiencing.  I have lived in Colorado during three of the state's largest blizzards--the Christmas blizzard of 1982, the storm that started on St. Patrick's Day in March of 2003, and now this Christmas week dumping--and I have nothing but happy memories of these times, despite some roof leaks and mild cabin fever.  I long ago learned the rule for dealing with blizzards from my Nebraska prairie ancestors: if the weather outside is frightful, just stay put.  <br />
<br />
There's nowhere you have to be that badly, no matter what plans you might have made.  One year when I was a kid, I found that this rule, incredibly, extended to Christmas mass.  I had never seen my devout Catholic grandmother skip mass on Sunday or a Holy Day of Obligation.  But she didn't want any of us going out on the roads.  So the rule of snow trumped the rule of God that Christmas, and we stayed home in my grandparents' eastern Nebraska farmhouse and watched Pope John Paul say mass on TV.  <br />
<br />
I remember sneaking glances at the adults as they watched the TV, a little giddy to have gotten out of church in Ulysses and the bad singing of the old ladies in the choir.  I expected my grandmother and my aunts to remember themselves at any moment and herd us off to mass.  But my grandmother had almost lost the first three of her nine children in a prairie blizzard when they were in elementary school, and that memory still held sway.<br />
<br />
My mom has told me about that blizzard, the most frightening memory from her childhood.  It was in the 1950's, and she was perhaps six or seven years old, walking home with her older brother and her younger sister from the one-room schoolhouse called Happy Hillside, two miles east of their farm near Ulysses, Nebraska.  Their father usually came to fetch them from school when the weather turned bad, but he wasn't there that day when school let out.  They decided to venture home before it was too late.  The storm hit suddenly, and came on so strong that they couldn't see to move ahead.  They took shelter by a neighbor's bale pile, the only object they could make out, and their father found them before it was too late.  My mom read with interest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Childrens-Blizzard-David-Laskin/dp/0060520752" title="<i>The Children's Blizzard</i>"><i>The Children's Blizzard</i></a>, David Laskin's recent account of the 1888 blizzard on the Great Plains that hit in the afternoon and killed many children on their way home from school, thinking of what might have happened to her and her siblings.<br />
<br />
My mother said she'd never seen her mother so angry at her father as she was that day.  Now that I have a child of my own, I know that mothers sometimes need to make somebody else the whipping boy for the peril of their children.  Anger can help mask the sheer terror.  My six-month-old is 28 inches tall now, and the snow that has fallen outside our home is just about equal to her height.  There's nowhere we have to be, and when the snow stops this afternoon, I plan to blow off whatever work I was supposed to do today, bundle her in her snowsuit, and take her outside to enjoy the aftermath of her first blizzard, taking care not to venture too far from home.<br />

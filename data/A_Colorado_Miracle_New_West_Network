							The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4974258,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News reported today">Rocky Mountain News reported today</a> that the Denver Archdiocese is investigating a miracle attributed to "an 18th century Spanish missionary, Junipero Serra."   A Colorado couple claims that prayers to Serra on the behalf of their daughter Kayla Rebecca Kellog cured her of "severe fetal deformaties."  Serra, who did missionary work in Mexico and California, was beatified by Pope John Paul II, but needs to rack up some miracles to become a saint.  The process is a long one, though.  According to the <i>Rocky</i>:<br />
<br />
"In October, the doctors, as well as Kayla's parents, will meet with Buelt and other church officials to begin the inquiry. The Denver portion should be done by the end of the year. What follows will be a lengthy process that will involve multiple medical teams and ultimately a decision by the pope."<br />
<br />
This isn't the first claim of a miraculous occurrence in Colorado, though.  Pilgrims have long flocked to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.den-cabrini-shrine.org/" title="Mother Cabrini shrine ">Mother Cabrini shrine </a> near Golden, where it is said the waters have curative properties.  According to the book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0762739789?v=glance" title="<i>Colorado Curiosities</i>"><i>Colorado Curiosities</i></a>, in 1997 in the little town of Holly, Colorado, an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on a wall in a woman's home.  And there's the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.santafetrailscenicandhistoricbyway.org/sitetrin.html" title="Ave Maria Shrine">Ave Maria Shrine</a> in Trinidad, built in honor of an apparition of the Virgin Mary that Dr. John Espy claims he saw in 1908.<br />
<br />
As for the Serra miracle, the Colorado team of spiritual investigators is currently in the information gathering phase, and ultimately the Vatican will make a decision about whether or not the miracle is valid.  But don't hold your breath for the outcome--the process can take years.

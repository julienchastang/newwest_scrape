							<p>Artist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ashleymaskharris.com/" title="Ashley Mask Harris">Ashley Mask Harris</a> will perform a piece entitled &#8220;Dear Mr. President&#8230;&#8221; at the Boulder Book Store on March 14 (12-4 p.m.).&nbsp; She&#8217;ll set up with a typewriter and transcribe any message that passersby wish to send President Obama, then mail all the letters to the White House, &#8220;using the age-old tradition of letter-writing as the physical manifestation of American democracy.&#8221;  Several of Ms. Mask Harris&#8217;s friends will perform the same feat simultaneously in locations across the country.

<p>
The University of Idaho sent word that Creative Writing Professor Kim Barnes has sold her third novel to Alfred A. Knopf.&nbsp; The book will be called <I>American Mecca</I>.
</p>
<p>
I discussed this novel-in-progress with Ms. Barnes when I<a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_kim_barnes_part_two/C39/L39/" title=" interviewed her a few months ago"> interviewed her a few months ago</a> about her novel <I>A Country Called Home</I>.&nbsp; She said the forthcoming book is based on the experiences of her aunt and uncle, who took a job as a derrick foreman in an oilfield in Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
According to a press release about the new book: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The story is set in the 1960s in a gated compound of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), where the couple takes up residence in a seemingly utopian society as adopted members of the Aramco &#8216;family.&#8217; The corporate family is comprised of largely American and European professionals and Arab, Pakistani, Indonesian, Indian, Italian and Spanish laborers. As they occupy a new life of unprecedented luxury, the narrator&#8217;s husband is accused of killing a young Arabian woman. That tragedy, and the intrigue surrounding it, take place in a time of political and social upheaval in Saudi Arabia, when definitive features of an idealized American culture, transported to a foreign desert, collide with centuries-old values.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Barnes will share her writing process with her students at the University of Idaho. &#8220;Because I&#8217;ve placed this book on proposal, I&#8217;m just in the beginning stages of discovering and developing my characters inside this story,&#8221; Barnes said. &#8220;I have months and months of research, writing and revision ahead of me. Inviting my students to observe my process teaches them that writing is not about magic and immediate gratification &#8211; it&#8217;s about learning the craft and trusting the process. Writing is not a hobby or even a job &#8211; it&#8217;s a discipline that I will practice every day for the rest of my life. This may be the most important thing that we can teach our students.&#8221;

According to <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20090210/OPINION01/902100310/1014/OPINION" title="the Coloradoan">the Coloradoan</a>, Jane Tester, the owner of The Old Corner Book Shop in Fort Collins, closed the store Friday because of her recent stroke, but hopes to find a buyer for the store, a 50-year-old shop which she purchased in 1975.&nbsp; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/nview.jsp?appid=411&amp;j=626701" title="Shelf Awareness">Shelf Awareness</a>.)

		<p>Sadly, it is not the first book shop to close in our town. The Stone Lion bookstore closed many years ago and whenever in old town, I still see the stone lion on the side of the building and mourn the loss of a great bookstore. How about an article on the great bookstores of the west. Bozeman, Moab, Boulder, Jackson are just a few of the towns with great bookstores that could be featured. These stores are important. I hope they can hang on in these hard tiimes.<br />
Also, I'd like to give a shout out to the Clark City Press for continuing to publish great literature and understanding that reading books is a tactile experience. I wear their hat with pride.<br />

		<p>Thanks for the suggestion Michael.  Every once in a while I come across a great independent bookstore that still seems to be doing well, like Hamlet's Bookshoppe in Breckenridge.  It's in a Victorian house with a careful selection of books and a section on Western writers (at least they had this when I was there last year).  I've been to the bookstores in Moab and Boulder of course, but I'll have to make a trip to Bozeman and Jackson someday.</p>

		<h1>Wyoming Writers Roll On &amp; Western Heritage Awards Announced</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>

							<p>And now the moment we&#8217;ve all been waiting for: two weeks ago I asked New West readers to vote on what book I should review next.&nbsp; I was delighted and relieved when several people voted.&nbsp; The winner, with four votes, is <I>Staking Her Claim: Women Homesteading the West</I> by Marcia Meredith Hensley.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll review it next Monday.&nbsp; And since the voting was so tight, I plan to review the runner-up, <I>How it Looks Going Back</I> by Doris Knowles Pulis, in a few weeks as well.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As for the other two books: they&#8217;ll go back on my guilt pile, and I&#8217;ll get to them as soon as I can.&nbsp; Every time I open the cabinet where I keep my un-reviewed books, the books scream, &#8220;Pick me!&nbsp; Pick me!&#8221;  I&#8217;m okay with it, but it frightens the kids.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://wyofile.com/" title="Wyofile">Wyofile</a> has an in-depth feature by Susan Gray Gose on Wyoming <a target="_blank" href="http://wyofile.com/2010/03/wyomings-mystery-man-c-j-box-on-top/" title="mystery and thriller novelist C.J. Box">mystery and thriller novelist C.J. Box</a>.&nbsp; Gray Gose writes that Box &#8220;cranks out 1,000 words a day,&#8221; &#8220;publishes two books a year,&#8221; and that one of his novels could be adapted into a screenplay soon:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;The producers of <I>About Schmidt</I> (the 2002 New Line Cinema comedy) bought the rights to <I>Blue Heaven</I>. While many optioned books languish, this one seems to be moving forward. It&#8217;s received financing, and actors Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin and Joe Pesci have signed on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&#8226; In the past few weeks I&#8217;ve reviewed a cavalcade of books by Wyoming authors Alyson Hagy, Mark Spragg, and Laura Bell.&nbsp; (We&#8217;ll have a review of C.J. Box&#8217;s new thriller, <I>Nowhere To Run</I>, one of these days, too.)  I thought I was finished with Wyoming for a while, but then I learned that a new story collection by University of Wyoming creative writing teacher <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uwyo.edu/mainenglish/displayfaculty.asp?facultyid=3949" title="Brad Watson">Brad Watson</a>, <I>Aliens in the Prime of Their Lives</I>, will hit bookstores next week.
</p>
<p>
Watson boasts some major accomplishments: Last year <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/hard_times_at_the_university_of_new_mexico_press/C39/L39/" title="I mentioned his story "Visitation,"">I mentioned his story &#8220;Visitation,&#8221;</a> which appeared in The New Yorker.&nbsp; And Watson&#8217;s first novel, <I>The Heaven of Mercury</I>, was a finalist for the 2002 National Book Award.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure if Watson was in Wyoming when he published that book, but now that he&#8217;s been drinking the Laramie water for a while, his literary output can only get better, right?&nbsp; (And could somebody send me a bottle of that stuff?&nbsp; I could use the writing mojo.)

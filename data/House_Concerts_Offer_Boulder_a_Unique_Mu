		<h1>House Concerts Offer Boulder a Unique Musical and Literary Event</h1>

							<p>Last Saturday I attended a house concert and literary reading at the home of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.acousticrosh.com/" title="Brian Rocheleau">Brian Rocheleau</a>, a local musician who has been organizing these events for several months.&nbsp; The concert featured <a target="_blank" href="http://www.janetfeder.com/" title="Janet Feder">Janet Feder</a>, a Denver musician who directs the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naropa.edu/academics/undergraduate/music/faculty.cfm" title="Music Program at Naropa">Music Program at Naropa</a>, and my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/sasc/sub-scribe_s06/poetry/cat_altman/index.html" title="Cat Altman">Cat Altman</a>, a writer who teaches at the Student Academic Services Center of the University of Colorado and was a founding editor of the online literary magazine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/sasc/sub-scribe/" title="Sub-Scribe">Sub-Scribe</a>.&nbsp; Altman is currently working on a nonfiction book about the time she spent with Theravada Buddhist nuns in Thailand.
</p>
<p>
There were about two-dozen attendees seated around the perimeter of the concert room when Feder began to play.&nbsp; Feder is a composer and guitarist who has performed around the world and collaborated with such musicians as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boomkat.com/artist.cfm?a=13255" title="Fred Frith">Fred Frith</a> and Mike Keneally.&nbsp; She specializes in a technique called &#8220;prepared guitar,&#8221; or as she puts it, &#8220;adding things to my strings.&#8221;  She attaches a bit of metal, string, or other object to her guitar strings, which causes surprising effects in her compositions.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Because Feder alters her guitar for each song, she has to tune between every one, and she&#8217;s developed a winning on-stage patter to entertain the audience meanwhile. She began with a song that she said was about the heater in her practice room. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m supposed to write songs about my boyfriends and my cats,&#8221; she joked.&nbsp; At one point she asked if there were any classical guitarists in the audience, and said, &#8220;my friend has a specially reserved name for classical guitarists.&nbsp; He calls them classholes.&#8221;  Feder admitted to being a classhole herself for many years before she started adding objects to her strings, which she said made people laugh, &#8220;And I thought, oh, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been missing.&#8221;  Her songs have a meditative quality, combining repetition and variation with haunting effects such as the groan of a slide on the mournful song &#8220;Shouting Valley.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
After a brief break, the second act of the concert began, with Cat Altman reading her short story &#8220;The Beautiful People,&#8221; a fanciful tale about people who have to unbutton their chests and massage their hearts to avoid freezing.&nbsp; Feder played throughout Altman&#8217;s reading, and the music enhanced the fiction, picking up on the emotions of the story&#8217;s themes as well as the other-worldly atmosphere.&nbsp; Altman&#8217;s heroine, Maybelle, is a rebellious girl, and the story somehow combined the feel of science-fiction, coming-of-age narrative, and children&#8217;s literature, with a touch of horror-story gore thrown in.
</p>
<p>
Feder and Altman lingered to chat after the concert, and the evening was a wonderful way to enjoy the work of some local artists.&nbsp; Rocheleau will be continuing the house concert series (he offers information about how to attend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.acousticrosh.com/" title="on his website">on his website</a>), and he seems to have hit upon the perfect, cozy-up-to-the-artists offering to fill in a gap in Boulder&#8217;s entertainment scene.

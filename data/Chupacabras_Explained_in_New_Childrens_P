	I&#8217;ve been interested in southwestern folklore ever since I was a first grader soaking up the frightening tales of <I><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_llorona" title="La Llorona">La Llorona</a></I> my classmates told out on the playground.&nbsp; Since then I&#8217;ve asked everyone to share their version of the <I>La Llorona</I>  ("the weeping woman") story, including my Guatemalan guide in Tikal, who began his tale&#8212;as the best storytellers do&#8212;with: &#8220;My uncle saw her once.&#8221;
<br />
  
<br />
Besides <I>La Llorona</I>, the most charismatic figure in southwestern folklore has got to be the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra" title="Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a>, whose name means &#8220;goat sucker,&#8221; and is described by Wikipedia as a  &#8220;legendary cryptid rumored to inhabit parts of the Americas.&#8221;  In their picture book <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fairy-Chupacabra-Those-Marfa-Lights/dp/0979839157/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219350120&amp;sr=8-1" title="The Fairy and the Chupacabra">The Fairy and the Chupacabra</a></I> (for children aged four to eight), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefairyandthechupacabra.com/" title="James A. Mangum and Sidney Spires">James A. Mangum and Sidney Spires</a> have portrayed the Chupacabra as a winged beast with green, purple-polka-dotted skin and pointy teeth who is &#8220;the most misunderstood of creatures.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	As the Chupacabra explains to a fairy named Javier, he doesn&#8217;t suck the blood of goats, as popular accounts would have it.&nbsp; Instead, he merely enjoys watching them.&nbsp; &#8220;To <I>chupas</I>, watching goats is like humans watching television.&nbsp; It is sheer entertainment.&#8221;  And far from being a bloodsucker, he&#8217;s a vegetarian, using his long fangs for &#8220;sucking the nectar out of the <I>sotol</I> flower.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Set in West Texas, the book features Mangum&#8217;s charming, colorful illustrations of regional flora, landscape, and fauna, such as the javelinas that Javier likes to ride, and big-eyed pronghorns, or &#8220;fluffy bottoms.&#8221; <I>The Fairy and the Chupacabra</I> is sprinkled with Spanish throughout, words that are easy to understand from the context and that are also defined in a glossary in back.
</p>
<p>
	Javi and Marisol are the children of a fairy family named de Veras that lives in the Glass Mountains near the village of Marathon.&nbsp; Their father is <I>el rey de las hadas</I>, the king of the fairies, and their mother is the queen.&nbsp; Javi is mischievous, and likes to go out riding pronghorns and javelinas, and one day he encounters a Chupacabra, who detains him long enough that his family begins to worry.&nbsp; The responsible Marisol sneaks out to retrieve her brother.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The story concludes in a big party, with the glowing fairies dancing and singing songs about Chupacabras, and their luminance produces the &#8220;Marfa lights.&#8221;  I hadn&#8217;t heard of these before, but <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfa_lights" title="according to Wikipedia">according to Wikipedia</a>, &#8220;The Marfa lights&#8230;are unexplained lights (known as &#8216;ghost lights&#8217;) usually seen near U.S. Route 67 on Mitchell Flat east of Marfa, Texas.&#8221;  Thus, the book serves to explain to little ones and render benign two mysterious regional phenomena&#8212;the Marfa lights and the legend of the Chupacabra.
</p>
<p>
The only drawback to <I>The Fairy and the Chupacabra</I> is that there is a lot of exposition and explanation that delays and is interspersed with Javi&#8217;s adventure.&nbsp; But apparently this is the first book of <I>The Fairy and the Chupacabra</I> series, so hopefully the adventures will move along at a faster clip in books to come now that the characters and settings have been established.

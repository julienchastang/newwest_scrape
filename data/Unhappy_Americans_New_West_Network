							I selected a panel discussion to attend on the opening day of CU's 58th annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/" title="Conference on World Affairs">Conference on World Affairs</a> almost at random, and it turned out to epitomize everything that makes the conference a unique, lively forum that is beloved by many.  The panel topics are sometimes broad ("Africa: Reclaiming its Future"), sometimes specific ("www.god.org: How the Internet is Changing Religion"), and the panelists are usually experts in fields that are not necessarily relevant to the topics to which they're assigned.  I headed for "Define Happiness" at the UMC on CU Campus.  The panelists included <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=557&year=2006" title="Achim Köddermann">Achim Köddermann</a>, a philosophy professor, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=523&year=2006" title="Kate Lehrer">Kate Lehrer</a>, a novelist, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=699&year=2006" title="Thomas Lewis">Thomas Lewis</a>, a psychiatrist, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=687&year=2006" title="Cathryn Weller">Cathryn Weller</a>, a storyteller, and they eagerly dived into the topic of "Happiness," seemingly undaunted by the philosophical nature of this question.<br />
<br />
Köddermann began by remarking that in various polls of Americans, only 30% describe themselves as happy, even though we are one of the wealthiest nations on the earth.  He believes that we have defined happiness as property in America, and that's what's making us unhappy.  He also described other countries, such as Bhutan, who have much less material wealth but whose citizens report themselves as being happy at a much higher rate.  People who become richer, he said, don't report becoming happier.<br />
<br />
Thomas Lewis drew the distinction between pleasure and happiness, saying, "In my practice, I treat people who are not happy, but can experience pleasure."  He then described the evolution of the brain, beginning with the reptile brain, which governs animal lives that are solitary and asocial, free of bonding or loyalty.  Mammals, he said, evolved with a different style of brain that enabled nurturing, loyalty, and affiliation.  The centers of pleasure are located in the reptile brain, but what makes people happy "by and large is connectedness with other people."  Happy people enjoy relationships that function for them and are embedded in a family and a community.  <br />
<br />
Lewis supported Köddermann's idea that there is no correlation between happiness and wealth, something he didn't believe until he treated a man who had 100 million dollars and was terribly unhappy.  "He kept talking about how his neighbor had a billion dollars, and worrying about how he was going to make a billion dollars." Lewis theorized that the U.S. ranks low on happiness rating lists because we increasingly lack connectedness, and that happy, poorer countries have a style of living that emphasizes family and community connectedness.<br />
<br />
Cathryn Wellner said that she believed that happiness has a lot to do with story, and gave as an example the defining stories of the two countries where she's lived, the U.S. and Canada.  She said that the U.S. story is individualistic, that it emphasizes conquering frontiers, and the Horatio Alger myth of people picking themselves up by their own bootstraps.  She explained Canada's founding myth as being more about connection.  "We didn't kick the British out, we came from here and went north because we were British loyalists." <br />
<br />
Audience participation is a large part of most Conference on World Affairs' panels, and at "Define Happiness," <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=656&year=2006" title="Patch Adams">Patch Adams</a>, a Conference participant who was sitting in the audience, was the first to speak up when Köddermann segued from the topic of happiness to the question: what is a joke?  Adams said, "A joke is the juxtaposition of something you expect with something you do not expect."  Adams is a doctor who founded the Gesundheit! Institute, a medical treatment center that emphasizes unorthodox methods.  He went on to declare that "happiness can be a choice.  At the age of 18 I decided only to be happy for the rest of my life," and reported that he's succeeded so far.<br />
<br />
The conversation wandered to a discussion of France, and its recent employment-law protests.  Lewis observed that it seemed like the protesters "want to be in a system where if you behave decently for a few years, they can't get rid of you," which he said is the definition of a family.  "The French have the idea that corporations should act like a family, an idea that is past its prime in America."  <br />
<br />
Audience members came and went throughout the panel discussion. This is typical of Conference panels, as there are often a number of different panels running simultaneously, and attendees can be anxious to see what they're missing one door over.  Streams of people began leaving when it was time for the audience question and answer period, while others eagerly queued up for the chance to question the panel.  Many of those who left early appeared to be CU students who had been assigned to attend and write about a panel; "Define Happiness" turned out to be a lively discussion that probably especially pleased attendees whose college years were long behind them, giving them a chance to relive the sort of intellectual debate that universities foster.<br />

		<p>Jenny, thanks for the great article. <br />
<br />
There has been so much mean spirited talk about old people on New West lately!!!  When I read the name Patch Adams in your article it was such a breath of fresh air. I hope our generation can remember a time before so many of our parents cashed out their ideals for a Lexus. <br />
<br />
Please, lets hear more.</p>

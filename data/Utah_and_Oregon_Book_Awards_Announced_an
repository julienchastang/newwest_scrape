Last week, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pw.org/content/two_celebrated_emerging_writers_win_oregon_book_awards" title="Poets &amp; Writers">Poets &amp; Writers</a> covered the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.literary-arts.org/awards/" title="Oregon Book Awards">Oregon Book Awards</a>, which went to poet Matthew Dickman for <I>All-American Poem</I>,<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Raymond" title=" Jon Raymond"> Jon Raymond</a> in  fiction for <I>Livability: Stories</I>, and state attorney general John Kroger in creative nonfiction for <I>Convictions: A Prosecutor&#8217;s Battles Against Mafia Killers, Drug Kingpins, and Enron Thieves</I>.&nbsp; I recently <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/graphic_novel_features_an_oregon_town_whose_fathers_have_gone_to_war/C39/L39/" title="wrote about some Western short-story-to-film adaptations">wrote about some Western short-story-to-film adaptations</a>, and Poets &amp; Writers mentioned that two films based on Raymond&#8217;s short stories have been produced:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Raymond&#8230;has two film credits to his name, both based on stories from the book. Wendy and Lucy, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008, was adapted from his story &#8220;Train Choir,&#8221; and Old Joy, a 2006 Sundance feature starring innovative musician Will Oldham, finds its origins in the story of the same title. Raymond is also the author of a novel,<i> The Half-Life</i> (Bloomsbury, 2004).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&#8226; The Center of the American West at the University of Colorado will be involved in two notable events this week.&nbsp; On November 5, center director Patricia Nelson Limerick will discuss the topic &#8220;Immigration and the Practical Majority?&#8221; with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_helen_thorpe/C39/L39/" title="Helen Thorpe">Helen Thorpe</a>, author of one of my favorite recent books, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/growing_up_illegal_in_denver_helen_thorpes_just_like_us/C39/L39/" title="Just Like Us">Just Like Us</a></I>.&nbsp; In her riveting book, Thorpe, the wife of Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, follows four Mexican teenage girls as they finish high school and college.&nbsp; The research for the book took Thorpe to some unusual places, such as a Mexican dance club in Denver, and to rural Mexico to visit one of the girl&#8217;s mothers. The discussion, sponsored by CU-Boulder&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/ArtsSciences/CHA/" title="Center for Humanities and the Arts">Center for Humanities and the Arts</a>, will take place in the British Studies room on the 5th floor of Norlin Library on the CU Campus (4 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
On November 12, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org/events/index.php" title="Center for the American West">Center for the American West</a> will mark the publication of a new book, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/BOOKS/bid2074.htm" title="Remedies for a New West">Remedies for a New West</a></I>, with a reading and discussion (Room 250, Eaton Humanities, 7 p.m.).&nbsp; According to a press release, the book is a &#8220;wide-ranging collection of essays&#8230;intended to provoke both thought and action&#8230;exploring a variety of issues facing the American West&#8212;disappearing Native American languages, deteriorating air quality, suburban sprawl, species loss, grassland degradation, and many others&#8212;and suggest steps toward &#8216;healing.&#8217; More than &#8216;dealing with&#8217; or &#8216;solving,&#8217; according to the editors, healing addresses not just symptoms but their underlying causes, offering not just a temporary cure but a permanent one.&#8221; Patricia Nelson Limerick, Andrew Cowell, and Sharon K. Collinge edited the book, and several contributors will be on hand to discuss it.&nbsp; Look for our review of <i>Remedies for a New West</i> soon.

		<p>Congrats on selling your novel, Jenny! Can't wait to read it.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By zambonir, 11-04-09</b>
		<p>those adaptations aren't "in the works,"</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-04-09</b>
		<p>Allen--thanks!<br />
<br />
And zambonir, you're right.  I've fixed the sentence above.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By burgy, 11-05-09</b>
		<p>Congrats on your book deal but it also makes me sorta cringe to see a books "editor" use this site to self-promote her own book Casts some serious doubt on your journalistic integrity, don't you think???</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-06-09</b>
		<p>Burgy,<br />
<br />
Don't worry, I won't be promoting my book here.  There are lots of other great books to mention every week.  There certainly won't be any review of my novel on New West when it comes out--with all the regional book reviews that have disappeared over the last few years, I'll be lucky to get a review anywhere, frankly.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to let people know about my novel because many of the readers of NewWest.Net/Books over the years have asked me via email and comments about when I might be publishing a book.  So there's the answer, and now I'll shut up!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Richard Wheeler, 11-07-09</b>
		<p>Congratulations. I had a look at the Permanent Press website, and discovered it is a distinguished small press in Sag Harbor that focuses on fiction. It says it is less interested in plot than in the grace with which the story is told. So I'll promote your novel a bit here: it was selected for the elegance of its writing.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By mbartley, 11-09-09</b>
		<p>Jenny,<br />
Wow, how wonderful. Congratulations. Beyond, your fine work here, I read your story in the Amazon contest and have looked forward to reading your stories ever since. As to Burgy's comment, shout it Jenny shout it from Flagstaff to the grasses rolling east and to the shining mountains soaring west. Shout it sing it and keep that mile wide smile that I am sure lights your face. Again, congratulations and good luck on your storytellers journey.<br />

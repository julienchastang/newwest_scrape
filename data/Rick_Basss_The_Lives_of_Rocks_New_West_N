	Rick Bass is best known for writing that features nature prominently, often focusing on his home territory in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yaakvalley.org/helpus/" title="Yaak valley">Yaak valley</a> of Montana, but in his fifth collection of short stories, <I>The Lives of Rocks</I> (which came out in paperback this month), he stretches out, setting his tales in many of the other places he&#8217;s lived, including Houston and Mississippi, where some of his earliest fiction took place.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
All of Bass&#8217;s stories involve characters engaging with the natural world in some way, whether they live in the woods or in the suburbs, so the Montana stories still sit comfortably alongside the Gulf Coast ones.&nbsp; Several stories feature people doing what you&#8217;d expect from Rick Bass characters--hunting and preparing meat, hiking, and generally being efficient, competent, and outdoorsy.&nbsp; And sure, Bass can describe the gutting of a carcass as well as any writer working today.&nbsp; But throughout Bass&#8217;s fiction, there runs an undercurrent of weirdness and magic that surfaces several times in this collection and makes for some true surprises.
</p>
<p>
	Two of the strongest pieces, &#8220;Her First Elk,&#8221; and &#8220;The Lives of Rocks,&#8221; feature the same woman, Jyl, about whom we don&#8217;t learn much, apart from the fact that her father died three years before the first story begins and that she lives alone in the Montana wilderness.&nbsp; In the first story, she shoots a massive elk that she does not realize is on the private side of a fence.&nbsp; The owners of the land, two elderly brothers who have protected the elk herd, drive up to investigate the shooting, but when they see the hunter is an inexperienced young woman, equipped with nothing but a pocket knife to clean the animal, they melt, and touchingly lead her through the entire process.
</p>
<p>
	The next time Jyl appears, in the title story, she is the elder character.&nbsp; Still fairly young, Jyl is suffering from an unnamed cancer from which the doctors tell her only five percent of patients survive.&nbsp; She is alone in her cabin in the mountains, and her strength is diminishing as winter is approaching.&nbsp; &#8220;She slept at least as much as she had when she was a baby,&#8221; Bass writes.&nbsp; &#8220;Some days it was all she could do to get to the hospital for her daily treatment.&#8221;  She watches the activity of her closest neighbors, &#8220;a Fundamentalist Christian family&#8221; with five children.
</p>
<p>
	&#8220;From the Workman&#8217;s cabin came the sounds of industry at all hours of the day: the buzz of chain saws, the crashing of timber, the splitting of wood, the jingle-trace rattling of mules in chains pulling stumps and stoneboats to care out ever more garden space in the side of the rocky hillside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Jyl decides to send her hard-working young neighbors presents, whittling wooden boats, loading them with messages that tell a sequential story, and floating them downstream.&nbsp; Two of the children eventually respond to the boats, traveling to her house to help her with chores, such as woodcutting, that she is no longer able to do.&nbsp; The boats continue, and Jyl begins to long for the children&#8217;s visits--for the first time in her life since her father&#8217;s death, she finds she needs human companionship.&nbsp; When the children show an interest in her books, she teaches them from her father&#8217;s geology texts:&nbsp; &#8220;No rock is ever finished,&#8221; she reads, &#8220;all stones are continually being remade, until they vanish from the face of the earth.&nbsp; And yet, even then, once reduced to windblown dust, they are reforming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	This story is deeply felt, beautifully described, and in those little wooden boats has the element of magic that much of Bass&#8217;s best work shares.&nbsp; Even in some comparatively slight stories in the collection, such as &#8220;The Canoeists,&#8221; the quick tale of two young people spending their first flush of love canoeing on rivers and streams, Bass demonstrates his ability to describe a striking image from the natural world that has metaphoric implications for the characters&#8217; relationships:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The sides of their green canoe would be smeared with the wind-crushed bodies from the swarms of fireflies they&#8217;d driven through, some of them still glowing gold but becoming dimmer, as if cooling, and it made the canoe look special, and pretty, like a float in some parade, and people in the bar would come to the doorway and stare for a moment at it thus decorated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
One story, &#8220;Fiber,&#8221; is plainly different from all the others in the collection, and it was the lone tale to stick in the craw of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/books/review/Turrintine.h.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review&amp;oref=slogin" title="a few ">a few </a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401523.html" title="reviewers">reviewers</a> when the hardback was published last year.&nbsp; In this story, a character who resembles Bass gives up writing to become an activist.&nbsp; The story gradually loses any sense of plot as the narrator rails against &#8220;the brutality of supply and demand, and the omnipresent hyper-capitalism here at postconsumer century&#8217;s end,&#8221; and takes to task the Sierra Club, President Clinton, and the Nature Conservancy for their environmental failings.&nbsp; Though &#8220;Fiber&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make for great fiction, the anger Bass displays in it is bracing, and bodes well for his continued creative vitality.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes activism can ruin art, turning characters into polemics instead of people.&nbsp; When artists become overtly political, the first thing to go is usually their senses of humor, but Bass appears to be safe from this fate: the story &#8220;Goats&#8221; is probably the funniest thing he has ever written.&nbsp; In &#8220;Goats,&#8221; two teenage boys growing up in suburban Houston decide to become cattle barons.&nbsp; The narrator&#8217;s friend, Moxley, lives with his mentally declining grandfather &#8220;on forty acres of grassland about ten miles north of what were then the Houston city limits.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
They pool their money and start to buy deficient calves on the cheap from livestock auctions, and put them in a pasture of Moxley&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s farm.&nbsp; &#8220;We had attempted,&#8221; Bass writes, &#8220;in typical adolescent half-assed fashion, to shore up the fence with loose coils of scrap wire.&#8221;  All the calves escape, one after another, but the boys are not deterred.&nbsp; Eventually they are old enough to get their driver&#8217;s licenses and start buying stock from a decrepit livestock operation, ruinously carrying a knocked-out baby bull home in the back of their car.&nbsp; By the end of &#8220;Goats,&#8221; Bass manages to pair the overt comedy of the tale with a note of genuine regret, which makes it more resonant than a simple lark would be.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Lives of Rocks&#8221; won&#8217;t disappoint Bass fans who have come to expect sensitive, nature-based stories, but for as long as Bass has been at work on this task, his stories haven&#8217;t become formulaic.&nbsp; Rather, there is plenty that&#8217;s wild left in them, and in their author, apparently, too.

		<p>This is an excellent review. Thanks for writing it. I am going out to buy the book in Bozeman. Keep writing!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 11-01-07</b>
		<p>Bass has long been one of my favorite writers. Friends and I have seen him occasionally at different forums and the art vs. activism arguments that have followed have been interesting and passionate. What happens when a writers activism begins to negatively impact their writing? As some folks feel has happened with Bass. How does a writer achieve balance between their lives (that must infuse their work) and their writing? Can writers separate life from work? I am curious.<br />
Let me just add that I don't believe Rick Bass has lost anything as a writer. The Lives of Rocks is my exhibit A. Extraordinary stories. And, the two stories of Jyl that you highlight are two of the best I have read in a long time. Both moved me to tears. Jyl as a centerpiece of a novel would be exciting. Also, Where The Sea Used To Be is one of the most underrated novels I have ever read. Stonewalls and coffins will never be the same.</p>

Instant Karma: The Heart and Soul of a Ski Bum takes place entirely in Colorado and primarily on the slopes of Wolf Creek Ski Area, the Great Sand Dunes National Monument and the plains of this vast and beautiful state. Denver&#8217;s Ghost Road Press recently published this memoir by Colorado-based author Wayne K. Sheldrake, a self-proclaimed ski bum and a man who seems to have as many lives as a cat. Instant Karma follows Sheldrake&#8217;s life from troubled angry youth to self-actualized skier&#8212;with multiple near-death experiences, powder days and sand skiing in between. This is a book that will make ski patrollers wince, fellow ski bums shout out &#8220;Amen&#8221; and literary types pick up and put down the book in both annoyance and appreciation. 
</p>
<p>
Like many self-motivated, troubled youths, Sheldrake&#8217;s sport saves his life and keeps him alive, though it is also skiing which nearly kills him. He had bad luck in the growing up department and witnessed a lot of domestic violence. He catches his father beating up his third wife and wakes up in the middle of the night as his mother&#8217;s boyfriend threatens her with a knife. The only good thing that came out of his mother&#8217;s abusive relationship with that ski instructor was the pair of skis he left behind. 
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake admits to a bunch of dishonest deeds throughout his childhood including faking his own electrocution, stabbing a bully in the eye with an Exacto-blade and stealing. For Sheldrake, &#8220;stealing had little to do with the stuff I got. I loved the risk of stealing. I loved getting away with it. Skiing fulfilled the same obsession. Facing danger and getting away with it was deeply fulfilling.&#8221; Skiing has long been the savior for many troubled, yet talented people and I imagine Bill Johnson, gold medallist in downhill in the &#8217;84 Olympics, and one-time car thief from Southern California, shared a lot of Sheldrake&#8217;s feelings and fulfillments.
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake spends a good portion of the book dodging death at Wolf Creek Ski Area (where he was fired and rehired for the ski school multiple times) and suffers through a gamut of ailments including a heart attack, open-heart surgery, numerous broken bones, a shattered pelvis and a collapsed lung. Because of this, he writes, &#8220;everything common&#8212;the road, the stars, driving&#8212;had the intensity and newness of a miracle.&#8221; Sheldrake is a reckless skier&#8212;hucking himself off of various objects and skiing alone in blizzards. Why take so many risks? Sheldrake says, &#8220;the answer is simple. The stab of adrenaline already had its sharp, cold blade in me&#8230;I was proud to live with high-risk everyday. It defined me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake demonstrates a bit of the hubris that Chris McCandless has in Jon Krakauer&#8217;s <i>Into the Wild</i>. And if you&#8217;ve read the book or seen the new movie, you know that doesn&#8217;t always work out so well. This may have been the reason Sheldrake wrote Instant Karma. He recognizes that he&#8217;s one lucky bastard to be alive.
</p>
<p>
Form following function as it often does, Sheldrake&#8217;s writing sustains as many bumps and bruises as he does on the slopes. His footnotes early on in the book are strange, like having the last word in an argument with oneself. Later on he quits the footnotes and just explains ski terms that non-snowsliders wouldn&#8217;t understand. There are some places where Sheldrake gets too detailed, like a friend bragging about his athletic endeavors after one too many drinks. But stick it out because the stories are entertaining.
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake peppers his prose with metaphor after metaphor and some crash and burn but just as he hits glorious powder stashes with complete euphoria and blissfulness, so does he succeed with some of the analogies in the book. Sheldrake gets particularly poetic when talking about snow and this is where his writing shines. His metaphors for snow are as numerous as the words that Inuits have for it. For instance, &#8220;the snow came like dump trucks of Slurpies chucked into a merry-go-round of jet turbines,&#8221; and &#8220;flakes the size of potato chips descended like dragon flies, and snow stacked up in my front yard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake&#8217;s earlier influences say a lot about his style. He read Steinbeck, Hesse, Hemingway and Vonnegut. You can hear it in lines such as: &#8220;The skis came alive with their own pendulous consciousness. This happens sometimes. You feel like the skis know more than you do, as if they&#8217;re possessed of their own tactile sentience, infused with their own sixth sense. You let them go and follow.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
He&#8217;s insightful and creative. He says the improvisational aspect of skiing powder &#8220;makes skiing as sad as jazz. When the memory goes, it&#8217;s gone. You can never go back&#8212;not exactly.&#8221; He&#8217;s able to put a finger on the feeling that religious zealots and hardcore athletes experience at their own alters: &#8220;In the face of the first snowflake, I see the face of God, and in those who follow lesser but infinite gods, bringing mundane existence to a freezing halt, and I feel convincingly that I&#8217;ve arrived in exactly the place at exactly the time I was meant to be.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Sheldrake is reserved with whom he shares his soul&#8212;and powder stashes. It&#8217;s his gargantuan ego that gets him into trouble multiple times. As a fellow skier, I wouldn&#8217;t want to fight for untracked powder with him; I think he&#8217;d pass me a little too close, head down, intense focus in his eyes. He&#8217;d be going further, faster that any other, epitomizing the skier&#8217;s creed, &#8220;no friends on a powder day.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Some parts of the book make is seem as if powder days aren&#8217;t the only days Sheldrake prefers to fly on his own. But he does go through a small transformation throughout the book, as one would hope and expect to happen in a memoir. In rare moments with his wife Vreni and a handful of friends, he has a special reserve of intimacy. For Ted, a mentor during Sheldrake&#8217;s turbulent early years, his way of saying &#8220;thanks&#8221; is to share his joy of bottomless powder. &#8220;I wanted him to feel the wild, white undertow and the psychic cocoon of wide-eyed, amniotic awareness that cast the rest of the world in a distant, irrelevant light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Describing an out-of-control skier, Sheldrake says, &#8220;he looked like a calf roper vaulting out of his stirrups, red hair flaring.&#8221; That kind of description makes me shiver in my ski boots. The kid collides with the author, slamming Sheldrake into a tree and sending him to the hospital with a shattered pelvis. Sheldrake admits that he learns the hard way and that some of his accidents were probably Karma or payback for what he did wrong, like poach so many lift tickets. He reflects back upon the winter of &#8217;88 as a defining moment: While he lay recovering in the hospital, eleven skiers just like him died in Colorado. They were all &#8220;young, fit, confident, male&#8230;I felt lucky.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
I hesitate to recommend this book to my ski patrol friends who have an involuntary anger reflex against ticket fraud and asinine antics on the slopes. But I would recommend this book to anyone who is a ski bum or always wanted to be; or to those who enjoy reading authors who are so apt at explaining their passion that it makes you want to &#8220;ski to die, live to tell&#8221; as Sheldrake does. If you&#8217;re the kind of person who can learn from other&#8217;s mistakes, be a safer skier than he&#8217;s been. I hope that young skiers who stumble upon this book realize the irony of the title, which refers I believe to the lyrics in John Lennon&#8217;s song, &#8220;Instant Karma (We All Shine On):&#8221;
</p>
<blockquote><p>Instant Karma&#8217;s gonna get you,
<br />
Gonna knock you right on the head,
<br />
You better get yourself together,
<br />
Pretty soon you&#8217;re gonna be dead,
<br />
What in the world you thinking of,
<br />
Laughing in the face of love,
<br />
What on earth you tryin&#8217; to do,
<br />
It&#8217;s up to you, yeah you.</p></blockquote>

		<p>FYI, just a minor thing: It's Chris McCandless, not Alex.  Alex was Chris' name he gave on the road.</p>

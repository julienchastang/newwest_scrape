							<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ghostroad.wordpress.com/" title="Ghost Road Press">Ghost Road Press</a>, the Denver-based publishing outfit founded by Matthew Davis and Sonya Unrein, recently announced its intention to become a non-profit organization.&nbsp; In a message to Ghost Road fans, Davis wrote that the switch &#8220;will allow us to continue to publish the type of literary work that we most believe in.&#8221;  Davis noted that &#8220;there is no quick monetary payoff for our fiction and poetry collections,&#8221; and that &#8220;my father always says to me, &#8216;you just need that One Big Book!&#8217; But we know differently. We understand that the work we are most in love with--the work that we live to publish--is a slow and steady road whose dividends will pay off over time.&#8221;

This Roundup has been Colorado heavy, so I thought I&#8217;d mention an upcoming Montana event.&nbsp; Missoula-based author <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanities-mt.org/gregpatent.htm" title="Greg Paten">Greg Paten</a>t will present his new cookbook, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bakers-Odyssey-DVD-Celebrating-Time-Honored/dp/0764572814" title="A Baker's Odyssey">A Baker&#8217;s Odyssey</a></I> at Hamilton&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://chapter1.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp" title="Chapter One Book Store">Chapter One Book Store</a> on February 7 (7 p.m.).&nbsp; Patent won the prestigious James Beard Award for his previous book, <I>Baking in America</I>, so you know his family eats well.&nbsp; For those on the fence about whether to go to Paten&#8217;s reading or not, here&#8217;s the clincher: according to <a target="_blank" href="http://chapter1.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&amp;eventId=368238" title="Chapter One">Chapter One</a>, &#8220;Yes, we will have baked goods here for those who show up to hear &#8216;Food Guy&#8217; Greg Patent talk about his new book.&#8221;  So eat while the eating&#8217;s good!

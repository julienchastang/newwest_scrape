							<p>Every year since 2005, John W. Miller, the President of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ccsu.edu" title="Central Connecticut State University">Central Connecticut State University</a>, has been conducting a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ccsu.edu/amlc06/overview.htm" title="study of the most literate cities">study of the most literate cities</a>, ranking them &#8220;based on their support for and commitment to reading,&#8221; according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-12-26-literate-cities_N.htm" title="USA Today">USA Today</a>.&nbsp; In the recently announced results of the 2007 study, Denver placed 4th, rebounding from 8th place in 2006 (after falling from 6th place in 2005).&nbsp; Portland, home of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.powells.com/" title="Powell's City of Books">Powell&#8217;s City of Books</a>, ranked 6th in number of bookstores per 100,000 people, but dropped in overall rankings from 10th in 2006 to 12th this year.
</p>
<p>
The top five cities were Minneapolis, Seattle, St. Paul, Denver, and Washington D.C. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ccsu.edu/amlc06/overview.htm" title="Miller writes">Miller writes</a> that cities are evaluated using &#8220;six key indicators of literacy: newspaper circulation, number of bookstores, library resources, periodical publishing resources, educational attainment, and Internet resources.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
It makes sense that Denver would do well in such a survey, as the city is one of the few left with two major daily newspapers, a topflight independent bookstore in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/hickenlooper_reads_western_favorites_jenna_bush_bans_knitting_needles/C39/L39/" title="book-thumping mayor in John Hickenlooper">book-thumping mayor in John Hickenlooper</a>, and a great library system.
</p>
<p>
The top ten was fairly balanced regionally: three cities are in the West (Seattle, Denver, San Francisco), three in the Midwest (Minneapolis, St. Paul, St. Louis), three in the East (Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Boston), and one in the South (Atlanta).
</p>
<p>
So, to repeat my question from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/in_search_of_the_literature_of_the_urban_west/C39/L39/" title="last week's Roundup">last week&#8217;s Roundup</a>, is Denver the most literate city about which the least literature is published?
</p>
<p>
Denver will live up to its literary reputation this month with the premier of Eric Schmiedl&#8217;s stage adaptation of Kent Haruf&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvercenter.org/event_calendar/caldetail.cfm?id_production=41626288" title="Denver Center for Performing Arts">Denver Center for Performing Arts</a>.&nbsp; The play runs from January 25 through February 23 at the Stage Theatre.
</p>
<p>
In other news, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laweekly.com" title="LA Weekly">LA Weekly</a> recently published its list of &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.laweekly.com/art+books/books/our-favorite-undernourished-books-of-the-year/17948/" title="Our Favorite Undernourished Books of the Year">Our Favorite Undernourished Books of the Year</a>,&#8221; books that its critics felt deserved more attention.&nbsp; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.radiantdays.com/" title="Radiant Days">Radiant Days</a></I> by the Idaho/Montana writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radiantdays.com/author.html" title="Michael A. FitzGerald">Michael A. FitzGerald</a> was Jim Ruland&#8217;s pick.&nbsp; He writes, &#8221;<I>Radiant Days</I> might have flown under the radar, but it scores a direct hit.&#8221;  On <a target="_blank" href="http://vermin.blogs.com/bl/" title="Ruland's blog">Ruland&#8217;s blog</a>, he gives the story behind his decision: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;True story: Radiant Days had been sitting on my shelf for weeks until I read an interview with its author in New West. FitzGerald struck me as such an earnest, intelligent guy that I felt compelled to read the book, and when I did, it kind of blew me away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you missed the interview when it ran in June, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/an_interview_with_michael_a_fitzgerald/C131/L39/" title="check it out here">check it out here</a>.

<p>
	Many of the characters in <I>Wild Child</I>, T.C. Boyle&#8217;s new collection of short stories, try to maintain an air of refinement: they have a taste for good food and wine, they cultivate precise gardens, they wear expensive clothes, and they seek enlightenment.&nbsp; But usually these characters&#8217; baser instincts win out, or nature interrupts their careful plans and ruins their leather jackets with mudslides, torrential downpours, or forest fires.&nbsp; Most of the tales end up illustrating one of Boyle&#8217;s recurrent themes: that people are animals, first and foremost.&nbsp; As clear as Boyle&#8217;s themes can be, he&#8217;s no moralist, and the stories in this volume are as entertaining and transporting as Boyle&#8217;s fiction has always been.
</p>
<p>
	Boyle&#8217;s gift for plunging the reader into diverse consciousnesses produces a wide array of believable characters, from a proper Japanese couple who disapprove of their white teenage neighbor&#8217;s pyromaniac grilling technique in &#8220;Ash Monday,&#8221; to the nurturing mother of a Latin American major league pitching sensation in &#8220;The Unlucky Mother of Aquiles Maldonado,&#8221; to a young, college-educated black woman hired as a dog nanny by a rich couple in &#8220;Admiral,&#8221; to Victor, the famous feral boy discovered in France around 1800, whose history Boyle recreates in the riveting title novella.
</p>
<p>
	Besides skillfully conveying the private thoughts of his characters&#8217; minds and evoking their worlds through vivid sensory detail, Boyle also excels at structuring his tales for maximum dramatic impact.&nbsp; This is especially true in the suspenseful &#8220;La Conchita,&#8221; in which a man who delivers organs to hospitals becomes snared in an epic Southern California traffic jam when he&#8217;s trying to deliver a human liver before its transplant viability expires.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The cause of the jam is a mudslide that&#8217;s hit the little town of La Conchita.&nbsp; Traffic on the highway stops completely at the site of the mudslide.&nbsp; While the narrator is waiting for the jam to clear, a desperate woman leads him up the muddy hill to help dig her child and husband out of their buried home.&nbsp; The narrator is blas&#233; about the particulars of his delivery job, which involves saving lives, though he is a few steps removed from the actual saving.&nbsp; But when he is dragged against his will into assisting with a hands-on recovery effort in the mudslide, it sparks something in him, and he evolves from being a reluctant savior into looking to achieve the rush of helping others again: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And though I was wet through and shivering and my car was stuck and my shoes ruined and my hands so blistered I couldn&#8217;t make a fist with either one, I started back up the hill&#8212;and not, as you might think, to watch the lucky man emerge from the hole in the ground or to take a bow or anything like that, but just to see if anybody else needed digging out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
	&#8220;La Conchita&#8221; is a fiction rooted in fact: mudslides hit the California community of that name in 1995 and 2005, burying houses and killing ten people in the second incident.&nbsp; Several of the stories in <I>Wild Child</I> are based on news events, but all have a particular T.C. Boyle twist that present the situation from an angle that those who casually read of these events in the newspaper might not have considered.&nbsp; In 2005, Snuppy, an Afghan hound, became the first successfully cloned dog, copied from a three-year-old dog by scientists at Seoul National University.&nbsp; Cloning dogs remains an enormously expensive procedure, a fact that must have sparked Boyle&#8217;s take on this in &#8220;Admiral.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	In &#8220;Admiral,&#8221; the Strikers, a wealthy couple of middle-aged lawyers hire Nisha to look after their Afghan hound puppy for the exorbitant fee of $25 an hour, plus benefits.&nbsp; When she was in high school, Nisha dog-sat the Strikers prior dog, Admiral.&nbsp; Now Nisha has graduated from college and is back in her hometown after being laid off from work.&nbsp; Nisha hasn&#8217;t been keeping up with the news, but the Strikers inform her that Admiral was killed by a car and they paid $250,000 to have him cloned into Admiral II.&nbsp; The Strikers want Nisha to play with the second dog the same way she did the first, in the hopes of producing an animal with identical behavior.&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s nurture that counts,&#8221; Mr. Striker explains.&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to reproduce the animal&#8217;s experiences, as nearly as possible.&#8221;  Of course, Boyle doesn&#8217;t lay out all this information upfront, he teases it out with obvious delight, and complications arise.
</p>
<p>
	Boyle&#8217;s range is impressive in the fourteen stories in this collection, which vary in setting (though several explore humanity&#8217;s complicated relationship with nature in contemporary California), time period, and length.&nbsp; &#8220;Three Quarters of the Way to Hell&#8221; is a fun little ditty about a Christmas music recording session during the Sinatra era, and it&#8217;s followed immediately by &#8220;Wild Child,&#8221; a 60-page story that recreates the life of Victor, the Wild Boy of Aveyron, with great sensitivity and insight.&nbsp; <I>Wild Child</I> is a diverting collection for anyone seeking a vacation from his or her own skin.

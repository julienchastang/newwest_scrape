The Colorado Council on the Arts is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloarts.state.co.us/news/releases/pressrelease_7-25-08-Poet.htm" title="seeking nominations for the next Colorado Poet Laureate">seeking nominations for the next Colorado Poet Laureate</a>.&nbsp; Anyone in Colorado can nominate a poet&#8212;you can even nominate yourself.&nbsp; Nominations are due on October 1 to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradohumanities.org/ccftb/" title="Colorado Center for the Book">Colorado Center for the Book</a>.&nbsp; According to the press release, &#8220;Colorado became one of the first states to have a Poet Laureate when Governor Oliver Shoup appointed Alice Polk Hill in 1919. Since then five other people have served: Nellie Burget Miller (1923-1952); Margaret Clyde Robertson (1952-1954); Milford E. Shields (1954); Thomas Hornsby Ferril (1979 &#8211; 1988); Mary Crow (1996-present).&#8221;

Speaking of poets, Maria Melendez, a poet and lecturer based at Utah State, will present her piece &#8220;The Seven Gates to Aztlan (for mixedbloods)&#8221; on August 1 on the University of Utah&#8217;s Salt Lake City campus (10:30 a.m., Heritage Center Building).&nbsp; Melendez appears as a part of the National Conference for Latina Academics and Activists and she will perform as a participant in the &#8220;Reading with Chicana Authors and Poets&#8221; panel.

Finally, given the passionate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/montanas_jeremiah_rick_basss_why_i_came_west/C39/L39/#comments" title="response of New West readers">response of New West readers</a> to Rick Bass&#8217;s <i>Why I Came West</i>, I thought I&#8217;d mention <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guidelive.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN-bk_west_0727gl.ART.State.Bulldog.4d590a7.html" title="Bryan Woolley's review of the book">Bryan Woolley&#8217;s review of the book</a> for the Dallas Morning News.&nbsp; Woolley writes that &#8220;much of Mr. Bass&#8217; nonfiction comprises essays, sermons, screeds and manifestos about&#8221; his desire for the government to designate the remaining roadless areas in the Yaak as wilderness.&nbsp; He further writes: 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Although Mr. Bass calls his book a memoir, he writes almost nothing about his writing life and little about his family and background. The chapters amount to linked essays on such subjects as hunting, forests, the power of landscape, oil and glaciers. There&#8217;s much repetition, as if they&#8217;ve been published separately elsewhere.&#8221;

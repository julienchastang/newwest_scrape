		<h1>An Interview with Paula Reed</h1>
		<h2><i>Paula Reed, English teacher at Columbine High School, extends the story of Hester Prynne in her new novel.</i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 3-29-10</p>
			
			
							<p><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.paula-reed.com" title="Paula Reed">Paula Reed</a> is an English teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. who was inspired to write her fourth novel, </I>Hester: The Missing Years of &#8216;The Scarlet Letter&#8217;<I>, after teaching Hawthorne&#8217;s famous book to students for twenty years.&nbsp; Reed wrote part of a novel in the 1980&#8217;s and then set it aside.&nbsp; In the wake of the 1999 shootings at Columbine, which impacted several of Reed&#8217;s students, she returned to writing, and went on to publish three historical romance novels.&nbsp; <I>Hester</I> is her first work of literary fiction.&nbsp; I recently interviewed Reed for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/books/ci_14733259#axzz0jVLWsflP" title="Boulder Daily Camera">Boulder Daily Camera</a> about the history behind </I>Hester<I>, how Tiger Woods and Arthur Dimmesdale have a lot in common, and how writing has been an effective therapy for her.&nbsp; A longer version of our discussion follows.&nbsp; Reed will present </I>Hester<I> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://boulderbookstore.indiebound.com/event/paula-reed-hester" title="Boulder Book Store">Boulder Book Store</a> on March 30 at 7:30 p.m.</I>
</p>
<p>
<b>New West: You took some passages from <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> as the starting points for <I>Hester</I>.&nbsp; One is what you call <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paula-reed.com/readersgroup.html" title="on your website">on your website</a> the &#8220;big gap in the novel, those years between when Hester and Pearl depart from New England and when Hester returns alone,&#8221; and another is the supernatural power that Hester has, of being able to perceive people&#8217;s private sins.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Paula Reed:</b>  That comes from chapter five in Hawthorne&#8217;s novel.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not huge in the original novel, but basically that [Hester perceives sin] in everyone she sees.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a passage where he says that she realizes &#8220;if truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Hester Prynne&#8217;s.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a fairly substantial passage, but it&#8217;s not a major part of the book.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Why did you decide to expand on this power for <I>Hester</I>?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> I found it an intriguing concept.&nbsp; I do think it&#8217;s difficult to be dishonest when you are with people who are completely honest.&nbsp; When someone has already faced the worst about themselves, it&#8217;s easier for them to detect when other people are not being honest.&nbsp; It also made for an intriguing conflict for her staying among Puritans.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: When you started to write about Hester, did you feel that you already knew her, or did you have to do the typical searching around that a writer does when creating a new character?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> I definitely felt like I knew her.&nbsp; She&#8217;s so vivid in <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> and when you&#8217;ve taught it for twenty years, you know it backwards and forwards.&nbsp; I had to flesh out some of her past, creating a friend for her and imagining her childhood, because you don&#8217;t know much about that.&nbsp; You know from the original book that her mother died when she was young.&nbsp; You knew that she came from an impoverished, aristocratic family, and that was about all you really have.&nbsp; The question the kids always ask is, &#8220;What on earth did Hester Prynne ever see in Arthur Dimmesdale?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you have to do much research for &#8220;Hester,&#8221; or was the material familiar to you from teaching &#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; for so many years?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> For the character, not much, but for England at the time, massive.&nbsp; I had a very solid grounding in the theology of Puritans, but only the most rudimentary understanding of Cromwell&#8217;s England.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Why did you decide to plunge Hester right into the middle of the historical events involving Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s government?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b>  The year that the climax of <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> is reached is very clear because during it Governor Winthrop dies, and that happened in 1649.&nbsp; That means that if Hester is going to leave in a year, as Hawthorne says she does, if she goes to England, it is going to be under Oliver Cromwell.&nbsp; And that just seemed more interesting to me to write about than more of the mundane, everyday drudgery of the original novel.&nbsp; It gave her an adventure, and I wanted to give her a triumph that was not in the original book.&nbsp; That seemed like a good way to do it.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: It has been said that all historical books are in some way a commentary on the times in which they are written.&nbsp; Is that true for <I>Hester</I>?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b>  Unexpectedly, it was.&nbsp; And that wasn&#8217;t my original intention.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because history repeats itself or if it was my filter while I was writing it, but the whole time I was writing about Cromwell and Thurloe, Cromwell&#8217;s Secretary of State, I just couldn&#8217;t shake Bush and Cheney from my mind.&nbsp; Especially because they were talking about torturing people, and when it was justified to torture people.&nbsp; I was writing this throughout 2008, and I finished the book prior to the election that year.&nbsp; I definitely felt that there were parallels to the Bush administration, though those were not intentional when I started.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> and <I>Hester</I> are built around 17th-century laws that condemned adulterers to death or isolation.&nbsp; Today, the social norms are radically different, with some young girls aspiring to be porn stars or presenting themselves in racy ways on their Facebook pages.&nbsp; Is it harder to set a plot in a time when there are not as many taboos, because the consequences for a character&#8217;s actions are not as grave?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> We&#8217;re still a very conflicted culture about sexuality.&nbsp; One of the beautiful things about teaching <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> is that any time I teach it, somebody has made the news for adultery and we&#8217;re making a big, fat, hairy deal about it.&nbsp; I think you just can&#8217;t get a better example than Tiger Woods.&nbsp; He is Arthur Dimmesdale.&nbsp; He has this image as this pure, amazing, gifted, disciplined person, and he has been placed on the pillory, as Arthur Dimmesdale would have been if he had had the guts to step forward.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t know if you can necessarily say that it has changed that much.&nbsp; Yes, there are girls who say they are aspiring to be porn stars, but there were prostitutes in the 17th-century.&nbsp; There were young girls who aspired to be courtesans and to have the lavish lifestyle that that would buy, that their own social class wouldn&#8217;t have given them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not uncommon for me as a writer to take things from my world and place them into a historical context.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: After years of discussing other people&#8217;s writing, what is it like to discuss your own?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> My students have never read one of my books in my class.&nbsp; As a teacher of writing, I have talked about myself as a writer and the processes that I go through, and it does allow me to make it clear that I do understand where they&#8217;re coming from.&nbsp; I bring in my work after my critique group has had a chance to hack away at it, so that they can see that I too know what it&#8217;s like to pour my heart and soul into something and to have people say that this isn&#8217;t good enough.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I imagine as an English teacher, you often discuss symbolism and metaphor.&nbsp; Are you conscious of employing these techniques in your own fiction?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> Yes.&nbsp; For example, Hester has a relationship in this book, but it&#8217;s not a love affair.&nbsp; They&#8217;re very good friends&#8212;friends with benefits is what they are.&nbsp; And it is not coincidental that he is color blind and that he cannot see the color red.&nbsp; And Hawthorne is so intentional with his use of symbolism.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Audiences of the past were more patient with that type of thing.&nbsp; The number one criticism I&#8217;ve had from people who have been critical of <I>Hester</I> is that they don&#8217;t like the supernatural element.&nbsp; They find that implausible.&nbsp; I find it interesting that they&#8217;re not saying it was also implausible when Hawthorne put it in there.&nbsp; My students find it ridiculous in <I>The Scarlet Letter</I> when Hester is standing on the scaffold with Pearl and Arthur and a comet lights up the sky and the tail turns into a scarlet letter A.&nbsp; These kinds of uses of symbolism that were so obvious, my students just don&#8217;t buy it, and that&#8217;s part of being a modern audience.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Your early attempts at fiction writing were in the historical romance genre, as were your first published books.&nbsp; Did you always want to write romances, or what were your aspirations as a writer?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b>  I started writing a romance novel in the late 1980&#8217;s, and that was simply because I read a lot of them.&nbsp; And I just thought, &#8220;I could write one of these.&#8221;  I got partway through it and I had kids and I was busy and put it on hold.&nbsp; For a lot of years I didn&#8217;t think much about it.&nbsp; It was not that important to me&#8212;it was a lark, something fun to try.&nbsp; When I went back to writing it, about a year after the shootings, it was a means of escape.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t think about it much in terms of being a career.&nbsp; I thought it would be fun and healing, which it definitely was.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: So you went back to writing after the shootings at Columbine.&nbsp; Can you tell me what happened to you that day, and how you found your way back to writing afterward?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> That day I was teaching a class that I team taught, so half of the class was in the tech lab with one teacher, and the other half was with me in the classroom.&nbsp; Because there were so few kids there, I ran across the hall to the bathroom.&nbsp; As I was washing my hands, the fire alarm went off and I thought it was a regular fire alarm because we could not hear in our part of the building.&nbsp; When I got outside, kids were running past, screaming, &#8220;They&#8217;ve got guns!&#8221;  I thought the kids were overreacting, because that was preposterous.&nbsp; Then administrators ran by and told us to get kids over the fence and into the park because there were kids with guns and they were shooting.
</p>
<p>
I spent most of the day at the Columbine Public Library helping kids and parents get matched back up again.&nbsp; For a good portion of that day, I did not know what was going on at the school.&nbsp; When all was said and done, I was coaching speech at the time, and I had lost two kids from my speech team, and one kid from my class the previous year.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I had a number of students affected.&nbsp; There was a student who was coming from the tech lab to the classroom to ask me a question, and she was shot.&nbsp; She lived.&nbsp; It was a lot to deal with.
</p>
<p>
The next year was pretty overwhelming for all of the teachers.&nbsp; I went back with everybody.&nbsp; We took two weeks off and then we finished out the year at Chatfield because our school was a crime scene.&nbsp; I went back the next year and I stayed until the kids who had been freshmen graduated.
</p>
<p>
The first year was just survival.&nbsp; I was so disassociated from my family and from everything because it was just exhausting.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really a very positive, confident, upbeat person, so my husband was wondering what the hell happened to the woman that he married, who was chronically depressed and angry and difficult.&nbsp; He was the one who said, &#8220;You need something that is yours.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve got to do something to get away from this, to nourish yourself some.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you finish that book?&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
I had started that first book on a Commodore computer, and all I had was a dot matrix hard copy of what I had done, and one of those giant floppy discs.&nbsp; A student of mine at the time, who also loved romance novels, ran the dot matrix through a character recognition program and turned it into a Word file.&nbsp; And I finished it and it was terrible.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just God awful.&nbsp; It will never see the light of day.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Was the process of writing it fun for you?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> It was really great.&nbsp; I started to feel like myself.&nbsp; I got another idea for a book and I wrote most of it over a summer.&nbsp; It was just so great.&nbsp; It could be cathartic when I wanted it to be, it could an escape when I wanted it to be.&nbsp; I had fun, and I hadn&#8217;t had fun in a long time.&nbsp; I was feeling pretty connected again.
</p>
<p>
Then that third year back at the school, I hit a wall.&nbsp; I walked into the school before we even had kids and I thought, this is a mistake, I can&#8217;t be here.&nbsp; Then 9-11 happened, and I got PTSD again in the worst way, and wrote another book.&nbsp; It was such a great way to deal with a lot of that stuff.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Do you avoid writing about anything having to do with this trauma?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> Well, in my second published historical romance novel, <I>For Her Love</I>, my heroine has post-traumatic stress disorder.&nbsp; So I could pull bits and pieces in, but I got to pick which bits and pieces I wanted to deal with.&nbsp; There are elements of my own life in these books, but certainly not school shootings and that kind of stuff.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: So you ultimately decided to take two years off from teaching?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> Yes, and that&#8217;s when I found my agent, for the second book that I had written.&nbsp; Kristin [Nelson] said, &#8220;I love it, but you marry off two perfectly good men at the end and I want you to un-marry them and write proposals for two more books.&#8221;  And she sold all three of those on a three-book contract.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You say on your website that when you had the idea for <I>Hester</I>, you wanted to write a book that moved beyond the romance genre.&nbsp; Are there strict rules for writing romance novels?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> People like to think of romance writing as paint by number, and it&#8217;s really not that, but the strict rule is that the main plot line has to be about a man and a woman falling in love, and it has to end happily ever after.&nbsp; Those are the only strict rules.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But in terms of marketing, they&#8217;re getting lighter and lighter, and my writing was getting more serious.&nbsp; So that just wasn&#8217;t selling.&nbsp; The plot lines weren&#8217;t working.&nbsp; During the two years off, I wrote another historical romance that was a little more serious that Kristin and I both loved, but we couldn&#8217;t find anyone to buy it.&nbsp; Finally she said, &#8220;This just isn&#8217;t your genre any more.&nbsp; What you want to write is not selling.&#8221;  She told me to take some time off and figure out what I wanted to do.&nbsp; I&#8217;d already been playing with this idea [for <I>Hester</I>], with this hot thing in the market of spin-offs from Jane Austen and Tom Sawyer, and <I>Ahab&#8217;s Wife</I> was a bestseller.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Was there any problem to try to sell a book of literary fiction after having published romance novels?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> Not to publishers.&nbsp; I have seen in some people who&#8217;ve written reviews of <I>Hester</I>, it&#8217;s really obvious who went to my website and found out that I was a historical romance author, because they come with the assumption that I can&#8217;t write literature.&nbsp; I had one reviewer say that it was a &#8220;bodice ripper.&#8221;  I was like, &#8220;Tootsie roll, I wrote bodice rippers.&nbsp; <I>Hester</I> was not a bodice ripper.&nbsp; If you want one of those, I can produce one for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How many books have you written in the ten years you&#8217;ve been doing this?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> Including the one I just finished, eight.&nbsp; And I&#8217;ve published four of those.&nbsp; I try to make sure that I&#8217;m doing it as much for me as I am for a reader.&nbsp; The book I just finished, I don&#8217;t know how sellable it is.&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of hard to fit into a genre.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a post-apocalyptic time travel.&nbsp; The post-apocalyptic part feels very old past.&nbsp; But I really wanted to tell the story.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to write just to sell.&nbsp; I want to write what I want to write.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not proud, I&#8217;ll change things to sell, but I want it to stay fun.&nbsp; If it sells great, if not, I had fun writing it.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I noticed on your website that a couple of your students attended your reading at the Tattered Cover.&nbsp; Have they read your book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>PR:</b> They are in the process.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re not in my classes currently.&nbsp; None of my current students are reading it.&nbsp; They&#8217;re excited about it.&nbsp; I think the thing that&#8217;s most off-putting to them is that I do tell them upfront, there&#8217;s not a lot of sex in this book.&nbsp; There is some.&nbsp; And if you&#8217;re going to get freaked out by sex scenes written by your English teacher, you don&#8217;t want to read this book.

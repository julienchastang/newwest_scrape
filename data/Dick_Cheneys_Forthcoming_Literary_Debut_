							<p>Vice President Dick Cheney will be doing more than hunting and fishing when he moves back to Wyoming from Washington&#8212;he recently told Sean Hannity that he is considering writing a book about his time in office.&nbsp; Cheney said, &#8220;My family has been bugging me about [writing a book]. I&#8217;ve got 40 years since I came to town to stay 12 months. I&#8217;ve got a lot of stories to tell. And a few scores to settle.&#8221;  (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/01/dick-cheney.html" title="LA Times">LA Times</a> &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/vice_president_dick_cheney_is_writing_a_book_105647.asp?c=rss" title="Galleycat">Galleycat</a>).

Perhaps Cheney&#8217;s future tome will join the shortlist of Wyoming classic books.&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp; Tom Nissley recently shared his opinions of the best Wyoming books for the blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omnivoracious.com/2009/01/the-books-of--1.html" title="Omnivoracious">Omnivoracious</a>, for its &#8220;Books of the States&#8221; series.&nbsp; Nissley writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jack Schaefer, author of <I>Shane</I> and over a dozen more Westerns, was an Oberlin grad and an Eastern newspaperman who fell in love with the Old West but only moved out to New Mexico later in life (and, as far as I can tell, hadn&#8217;t even set foot in Wyoming when he wrote Shane). Wyoming, as a literary state, seems to exist mostly as an idea in the head of writers from the East: the best-known classic Wyoming book, <I>The Virginian</I>, was written by a friend of Theodore Roosevelt who prepped at St. Paul&#8217;s [edited per O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s comment below] and had two Harvard degrees, while the best-known modern Wyoming book (or at least story), &#8220;Brokeback Mountain,&#8221; is by a woman who lived in Vermont for decades and moved out to Wyoming a few years before her story first appeared.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
In addition to the three works mentioned above, Nissley added Mark Spragg&#8217;s <I>Where Rivers Change Direction</I> to his list of essential Wyoming books, and notes that &#8220;I was so happy to find a promising book by someone born and bred in the state.&#8221;

		<b>Comment By H Lewis, 1-21-09</b>
		<p>I'm pretty sure I just read an article (<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fpolitics%2F2009%2F01%2F19%2Fcheney-wheelchair-pulling-muscle%2F">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/19/cheney-wheelchair-pulling-muscle/</a>) about Mr. Cheney moving into a new house in McLean, VA. House in Jackson is still just the "vacation home" so should he join the ranks of esteemed WY authors?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 1-21-09</b>
		<p>Thanks for the fact check.  As for whether Cheney will be considered a Wyoming author--well, that depends on whether someone raised in the state gets to keep his Wyoming status after he leaves.<br />
<br />
The Wyoming Author Wiki, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.wyomingauthors.org%2F">http://wiki.wyomingauthors.org/</a><br />
takes an inclusive approach, and Lynne Cheney is listed there.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Geezer, 1-23-09</b>
		<p>Cheney's book - a work of fiction?  I'll put it on the shelf right next to "The Collected Wisdom of George W. Bush" (a slim volume).</p>

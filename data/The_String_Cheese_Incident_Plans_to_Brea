							Colorado's most successful jam band is planning to call it quits soon.  Boulder's The String Cheese Incident posted this message on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stringcheeseincident.com/" title="their website">their website</a> recently:<br />
<br />
"After summer 2007, Billy Nershi is leaving The String Cheese Incident to pursue other musical projects. There will be only a limited number of Incidents between now and then.  Current plans include Thanksgiving in Atlanta, a New Years Eve blowout in San Francisco, Winter Carnival in Colorado, and a return to Red Rocks. Presently, there are no plans for The String Cheese Incident beyond summer of 2007."<br />
<br />
According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/music/article/0,2792,DRMN_54_5125763,00.html" title="an article">an article</a> in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, "The band launched in 1993, playing mountain resorts in exchange for free lift tickets. Constant touring and five albums built up a fan base that would travel with the band across the country, particularly to attend Red Rocks shows."<br />
<br />
As The String Cheese Incident's popularity grew over the years with the rise of the jam band scene, it also became an increasingly lucrative endeavor.  The band formed its own record label, SCI Fidelity, through which it released its own recordings and those of other bands.  It also started selling tickets to its shows through its website, and even took on Ticketmaster in a lawsuit in 2003 that was settled out of court.<br />
<br />
With Leftover Salmon, Boulder's other jam giant, on hiatus, SCI's break up will leave local jam fans bereft.  But there are always plenty more jam bands, including local favorites Yonder Mountain String Band, to pick up where SCI left off.<br />

							Denver's Office of Cultural Affairs recently opened the competition to name <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/DenverPoetLaureate/" title="Denver's first living Poet Laureate">Denver's first living Poet Laureate</a>. The award is open to all poets in the metro areaâ€”according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/DenverPoetLaureate/template115260.asp" title="the FAQ">the FAQ</a>, that means if you live in Denver, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas or Jefferson county and youâ€™ve published a book of poetry in the past ten years, you qualify to apply. Book-loving Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper initiated the title of Denver Poet Laureate last September when he awarded it posthumously to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/lalodelgado/template115255.asp" title="Lalo Delgado">Lalo Delgado</a>, a beloved community figure, poet, Chicano activist, and long-time professor of Chicano Studies at Metro State in Denver who died at age 73 on July 23, 2004. <br />
<br />
Hickenlooper could be the most literature-friendly mayor in the country.  He spearheaded Denverâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/dephome.asp?depid=1747" title="One Book, One Denver">One Book, One Denver</a> program, ultimately selecting Sandra Cisnerosâ€™ rollicking <i>Caramelo</i> for public discussion. Hickenlooperâ€™s bookish wife, Helen Thorpe, used to write â€œTalk of the Townâ€? pieces for <i>The New Yorker</i>. One of his bars, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wynkoop.com/" title="Wynkoop Brewery">Wynkoop Brewery</a>, recently hosted a successful literary event, First Fiction, which brought five debut novelists to read in front of a crowd swilling discounted microbrews.  Plus, I have personally seen Mayor Hickenlooper shopping with his son Teddy at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a> in LoDo.  Now if he would only get the knuckleheads behind the sketchy, now moribund Rocky Mountain Book Festival in line and convince Governor Bill Owens to let the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloarts.state.co.us/" title="Colorado Council on the Arts">Colorado Council on the Arts</a> fund grants for writers againâ€¦but I digress.<br />
<br />
According to Denverâ€™s website, the poet laureateâ€™s â€œbasic term is two years, renewable for a maximum of eight years in the post,â€? and he or she will be paid $2000 per year, but the prestige factor is, as they say, priceless.  While the application requires a couple of recommendations, each poet must nominate himself or herself.  Itâ€™s impossible to say who will enter the running, but there are several prime contenders.  <br />
<br />
Boulderâ€™s poetry bench is extremely deep, stocked with professors at Naropa and CU. Naropaâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/522" title="Anselm Hollo">Anselm Hollo</a> looks the part of the Poet Laureate with his dignified air and leonine beard. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naropa.edu/faculty/hawkins.html" title="Bobbie Louise-Hawkins">Bobbie Louise-Hawkins</a>, also of Naropa, is a longtime Boulder poetry scenester, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poetspath.com/waldman.html" title="Anne Waldman">Anne Waldman</a>, the beat poet who co-founded the institute alongside Allen Ginsberg in 1974, could be the strongest contender.  But donâ€™t count out CUâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/English/facpages/cervante.html" title="Lorna Dee Cervantes">Lorna Dee Cervantes</a>, who might be the Naropa triumverateâ€™s toughest Boulder competition.<br />
<br />
In Denver proper, thereâ€™s Mark Irwin, who has taught at CU and DU, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.du.edu/~bramke/" title="Bin Ramke">Bin Ramke</a>, editor of <i>Denver Quarterly</i>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldofpoetry.org/cv_i2.htm" title="Cecilia VicuÃ±a">Cecilia VicuÃ±a</a>, who recently joined DUâ€™s faculty. And on the less-academic front, thereâ€™s the spoken-word artist Isis, who hosts the monthly poetry slam at CafÃ© Nuba in Five Points and recently performed an opening set for the touring Def Poetry Jam show at the Paramount.<br />
<br />
And who knows what as-yet-uncelebrated poets could surface from Adams County to claim the Poet Laureate title.  Vegas, apparently, is not yet taking bets.

							An article in yesterday's <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> detailed a flap over the content of a MySpace.com page by Rob Smoke, a member of Boulder's Human Relations Commission.  His <a target="_blank" href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=74323729" title="profile page">profile page</a> contains the motto: "I'm tired, I'm hungry, I'm horny, I'm stoned...and I'm a city official," which he says is "a paraphrasing of a lyric from The Doors' song "I'm Horny, I'm Stoned."  According to the <i>Rocky</i>, Smoke was one of the key figures behind the Boulder City Council's "Hate Hotline," which I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/8383/" title="made fun of">made fun of</a> earlier this year.  According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/editorials/article/0,1713,BDC_2489_4987726,00.html" title="a recent editorial">a recent editorial</a> in the Boulder <i>Daily Camera</i>, "Smoke is under scrutiny by the City Council for 'using his (public) office' in connection with 'solicitation of relationships' on myspace.com."<br />
<br />
According to Smoke's MySpace profile, he's a 50-year-old, single, straight Taurus who doesn't want kids and is interested in "Networking, Dating [and] Friends."  The first line in his bio mentions that he's "a Commissioner of Human Relations for the City of Boulder, Co," but he doesn't seem be trying to work that angle too hard throughout the page.  His approach seems to be working, as one of his MySpace friends is "Amanda," who appears in her photo as a pink panty-clad ass.<br />
<br />
Whatever your opinion on Mr. Smoke's page, the fun of this story will be watching the fight between him and the council develop.  Councilwoman Suzy Ageton is lined up against him, and they will discuss the matter at tonight's City Council meeting.

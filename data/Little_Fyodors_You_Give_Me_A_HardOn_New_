							If you're offended by this Friday's MP3 feature, Colorado's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.littlefyodor.com/" title="Little Fyodor">Little Fyodor</a> will surely be pleased.  The bio on his website refers to his music as a "unique brand of avant-pop madness," and well, that's as good a description as any of what Little Fyodor produces.  Live, he's accompanied by sidekick Babushka, as he will be during his performance with Voodoo Organist and The Sleepers this Friday, April 14 at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benderstavern.com" title="Bender's Tavern">Bender's Tavern</a>.  When Little Fyodor isn't cooking up his own weird confections, he spins those of others, as he's hosted KGNU's "<a target="_blank" href="http://kgnu.org/ht/freeform.html#underfloorboards" title="Under The Floorboards">Under The Floorboards</a>" for over twenty years, serving up "experimental and idiosyncratic sounds of the underground."<br />
<br />
Little Fyodor has offered New West readers a track from his most recent CD, <i>The Very Best of Little Fyodor's Greatest Hits</i>.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/MP3s/littlefyodor.mp3" title="Click here to listen to "You Give Me A Hard-On."">Click here to listen to "You Give Me A Hard-On."</a><br />
<br />
After this week's show at Bender's, Little Fyodor will next appear at Denver's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspace.com/rhinoceropolis" title="Rhinoceropolis">Rhinoceropolis</a> on April 28 (9 p.m., $5), and then in July, he's planning to take his show on the road for a performance in Laramie, Wyoming.  The venue will be announced <a target="_blank" href="http://www.littlefyodor.com/" title="on his website">on his website</a> this summer.<br />

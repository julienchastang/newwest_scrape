							<p>Utah native Ron Carlson is one of my favorite short story writers&#8212;his humor and insights are always sharp, his plots are engaging, and his characters convincing.&nbsp; His stories are often set amid dynamic Western landscapes that he describes expertly.&nbsp; Lately Carlson has been taking a break from short stories, however, to continue his career as a novelist.&nbsp; He published two novels early on, 1977&#8217;s <I>Betrayed by F. Scott Fitzgerald</I> and 1981&#8217;s <I>Truants</I> before switching his focus to stories for over two decades.&nbsp; In 2003 he published a young adult novel, <I>The Speed of Light</I>, and two years ago he came out with his first novel for adults in 26 years, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/mountain_men_ron_carlsons_five_skies/C104/L104/" title="Five Skies">Five Skies</a></I>.&nbsp; When <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_ron_carlson/C39/L39/" title="I interviewed him about that book">I interviewed him about that book</a>, he said he couldn&#8217;t explain why he recently decided to shift back to writing novels:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve written a number of stories in the past two years,&#8221; Carlson said, &#8220;but I am writing novels.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t say why.&nbsp; Something happened to me, my desire to sustain these dreams.&nbsp; The pleasures and challenges of the longer form have my attention now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The folks at the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2009/03/carlsons-latest-novel-set-in-wind.html" title="Wyoming Arts Blog">Wyoming Arts Blog</a> recently noted that Carlson&#8217;s new novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670021000,00.html?strSrchSql=signal+ron+carlson/The_Signal_Ron_Carlson" title="The Signal">The Signal</a></I> (Viking, $25.95) is due out in June, and that it will be set in Wyoming&#8217;s Wind River Range.&nbsp; The book received a starred review in Publisher&#8217;s Weekly (that means they considered it extra good).&nbsp; The PW reviewer writes; &#8220;The dense Wind River Mountains of western Wyoming is where Carlson (<I>Five Skies</I>) sets his brooding latest, a tale of expired love and desperate measures&#8230;Carlson has produced a work of masterful fiction, combining the sad inevitability of a doomed relationship with sheer nail-biting suspense.&#8221;  It sounds like it will be a great read for the summer.

The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_11962685" title="Denver Post reported">Denver Post reported</a> that Thomas G. Andrews, an assistant history professor at the University of Colorado at Denver, will receive the $10,000 Bancroft Prize from Columbia University for his 2008 book <i>Killing for Coal: America&#8217;s Deadliest Labor War</i>.&nbsp; The award is given for books of &#8220;exceptional merit in the fields of American history, biography and diplomacy,&#8221; and Andrews shares the award with two other writers, Drew Gilpin Faust for <i>This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War</i> and Pekka H&#228;m&#228;l&#228;inen for <i>The Comanche Empire</i>.&nbsp; Andrews told the Post, &#8220;I never really thought I would ever achieve this,&#8221; Andrews said. &#8220;I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to call me and tell me it&#8217;s an elaborate practical joke.&#8221;   Watch for our review of the book in the coming weeks.

		<p>I can't tell you how happy I am to have another Carlson novel. As a long time traveler in and around the Winds, I am excited to read his take on that magnificent range. Five Skies was a beautiful story about men and work and the land. I discovered him through your work here at New West along with Deirdre McNamer's Red Rover. I can't thank you enough for bringing these wonderful storytellers and their stories into my life. Finally, I've just recently finished Killing for Coal and am looking forward to your opinion. Congratulations to Professor Andrews for a well deserved honor.</p>

							As is often the case when elections get down to the wire, political gaffes and sniping are on the rise in Colorado.  Like many registered voters, I am becoming innundated with political mail and phone calls.  In this morning's <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_5109359,00.html" title="Lynn Bartells reports">Lynn Bartels reports</a> on an auto-dial call scheme gone awry: <br />
<br />
"Southern Coloradoans were awakened early Sunday by an automated call from former U.S. Sen. Bill Armstrong, urging them to vote 'no' on a ballot measure that would provide various legal rights to same-sex couples."  One Ca√±on City woman said she was awakened at 3:50 a.m.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Colorado golden boy John Elway <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5109165,00.html" title="has recorded an automated phone message">has recorded an automated phone message</a> encouraging voters to pull the lever for Bob Beauprez.<br />
<br />
And Broomfield-based state rep Bill Berens "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_5109052,00.html" title="filed a complaint ">filed a complaint </a>with the Adams County District Attorney's office that a letter writer and a local newspaper may have violated a state law that prohibits false statements about a candidate."  He's mad about a letter to the editor published in the <i>Broomfield Enterprise</i> in which a citizen takes him to task for accepting prize money at a golf tournament sponsored by the Colorado Oil and Gas Association.

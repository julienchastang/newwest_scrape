							Roger Fillion reported in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> today that Colorado's Office of Economic Development's proposal for new "Welcome to Colorado" signs has rustled the feathers of many Coloradoans (<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4345242,00.html" title=""Signs of dissent for plan"">"Signs of dissent for plan"</a>).  Fillion writes, "On Friday, a negative commentary that was posted on the <i>New West</i> site about the proposed signs was the most commented-on article, attracting five comments that nixed the design."  (See <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/city/article/4967/C94/L94" title=""Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Welcome to Colorful Colorado' Signs"">"Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Welcome to Colorful Colorado' Signs"</a>)  The <i>News</i> has fielded several calls and emails complaining about the proposal to do away with the beloved classic signs, as has the Office of Economic Development.  Fillion&#8217;s article reveals that a cabal of "public relations, advertising and marketing firms" is behind the new, Wal-Mart-like design. In response to the negative publicity, Brian Vogt, director the Office of Economic Development, released a new Glamour Shot of the proposed design to the <i>News</i>, with the new bland sign apparently Photoshopped in over one of the existing signs.  In the photo featured in Fillion&#8217;s article, dawn is breaking over the Colorado prairie, bathing the sign in golden light.  But even with the best lighting tricks, this sign still looks like a two-bit poseur compared to the brown "Welcome to Colorful Colorado" signs, which have marked the state&#8217;s borders since 1950. As one caller to the <i>News</i> said, "Leave them alone.  It&#8217;s Western.  It&#8217;s retro.  It&#8217;s cowboyish."<br />
<br />
Governor Owens and the Colorado Transportation Commission still have to approve the proposal, so those interested in preserving the classic signs should email Governor Owens at governorowens@state.co.us or call CDOT spokeswoman Stacey Stegman at (303) 757-9362.

		<p>The state is literally trying to cast the new design in the best light possible. <br />
<br />
In the picture of the proposed sign, note that the photo is shot in the best light of the day – twilight – while most of the appearance of the sign is obscured by shadows. By contrast, the photo of the existing sign is shot in the worst light of the day – full afternoon sun. <br />
<br />
If they were confident in their design they would show the public an apples-to-apples comparison. Instead, they’re trying to trick us into buying their ugly fake rock.</p>

		<p>I don’t mid road safety signs ( <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afly.com%2Fview_release.php%3Frel_id%3D24772">http://www.afly.com/view_release.php?rel_id=24772</a> ) being updated but when they try to change a classic sign which has existed for many years it’s obvious they are running out of things to do. I hope popular demand wins and it stays how it is.</p>

							My Boulder condo faces the <a target="_blank" href="http://mapletonhomeassoc.blogspot.com/atom.xml" title="Mapleton Mobile Home Park">Mapleton Mobile Home Park</a>, and for several months I've been watching with interest a project that is developing there.  Students from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cu.edu/sg/messages/5050.html" title="CU's college of architecture and design">CU's college of architecture and design</a> are working with their professor to build what they call a "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.trailerwrap.net/" title="trailer wrap">trailer wrap</a>."  Mapleton donated the lot for their work, and they've gradually erected a good-looking, simple modernist home, building off the bed of an old trailer and using almost all recycled materials and the volunteer labor of students.  I spoke with a CU senior this weekend who was working on the project, and he let me inside the house for a tour.<br />
<br />
He explained that the project was designed and computer modeled by students who were seniors last year.  It was up to this year's class to implement the plans.  He said that there have been some glitches because "none of us have ever worked in construction," but that the hands-on work has been invaluable for the students, especially because they have had to make modifications to the plans when they discovered that certain aspects didn't work in practice.  <br />
<br />
The interior is still bare, so we could see the I-beams they set up to support the walls.  They were setting up an island in the area that will become the kitchen, using recycled butcher's block.  They were adding opaque plastic material to the tops of the walls all around, which let in a good amount of light, and the wooden porch was coming together.<br />
<br />
The young man said that after they are finished with the project, it'll be auctioned off.  "But I don't know who the money goes to," he said.  They have already received several offers."  Eventually, they hope to offer all of the material necessary to build the house in a kit so that people can build their own affordable housing.<br />
<br />

		<p>It is my understanding from talking to Bruce Wrightsman, the current CU professor overseeing archetectural students work on the TraileWrap project that it is not correct that a CU professor was fired over providing inappropriate course credit for this project. I am forwarding Bruce this article and expect he will post a clarrification soon. Others involved in this project may as well.I suggest to NewWest.net that there remains a journalistic merit to check facts before publishing a story. This article quotes only an unnamed CU student a second source for verification of facts seems to be missing. Feel free to contact me at 303.443.0007 ext 117 to get additional contact information regarding this project.</p>

		<p>I second this - as the representative of the mobile home park who helped get this project started, I find the errors in here grossly negligent. Although New West used my photo in this issue, I was never asked, credited, nor did anyone ask me to confirm the facts, which, as stated above, are false. <br />
<br />
Here are the lead architect's words:<br />
<br />
Hello Jim, (and everyone else) <br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.<br />
<br />
Just to add some clarification.... I was not fired.  I<br />
accepted another postition at the Univ. of Arkansas,<br />
but remain involved with the TrailerWrap project<br />
through regular contact with Bruce Wrightsman.  <br />
<br />
Also, I never gave anyone inappropriate credit for<br />
working on the project.  No faculty member at the<br />
University could do that even if they wanted to.  <br />
<br />
As you mentioned, it is unfortunate that someone chose<br />
to write this without checking their facts.  <br />
<br />
Also of note, the house has never 'sat idle' except<br />
for two week periods between semesters when all of us<br />
took much needed breaks.  <br />
<br />
We have been working on this project tirelessly for<br />
nearly two years with the participation of many<br />
students, faculty, and community partners.  It is<br />
unfortunate that someone has chosen to tarnish those<br />
efforts.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Michael Hughes</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Willem van Vliet, Professor, 9-28-06</b>
		<p>Anyone bothering to check the evidentiary basis of the statement concerning the purported firing of Professor Hughes will find that this allegation is totally unfounded.  Reporting this egregious error as fact is unprofessional journalism and a disservice to a productive partnership between CU and its community partners.</p>

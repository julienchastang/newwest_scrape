							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.readerville.com/WebX?98@207.kXOGavi1qPb.0@authors/svoboda_terese.html" title="Terese Svoboda">Terese Svoboda</a>'s new novel <a target="_blank" href="http://unp.unl.edu/bookinfo/4981.html" title="Tin God">Tin God</a> is the latest in the University of Nebraska Press' <a target="_blank" href="http://unp.unl.edu/books/flyoverFiction.jsp" title="Flyover Fiction Series">Flyover Fiction Series</a> series, which highlights what the editors describe as "fiction writers from the region in the center of the country referred to either sentimentally as the Heartland or dismissively as flyover country." Svoboda's book is an apt choice for this series, as the bulk of its action takes place in a cornfield, and concerns characters that would never be mistaken for city slickers.  Indeed, in this novel, narrated by "God," the deity is a country woman with a refined sense of the absurd. The picaresque tale she spins is often so oblique that it can be difficult to follow, focusing more on poetic turns of phrase than clarity of plot, so <i>Tin God</i> should please readers seeking an alternative to cookie-cutter fiction.<br />
<br />
Svoboda grew up in Nebraska, which she hints is the setting of <i>Tin God</i>.  The novel spans centuries, with part focused on the story of a conquistador who passed through the Midwest 500 years ago, and was taken for a god by an Indian tribe because of his mysterious blue eyes. The tribe, at the spurring of its leader Tall Pigeon Eye, puts the conquistador through a series of tests, including offering him a young woman so that he'll father a child.  Meanwhile in the 21st century, a pair of lunks named Pork and Jim are running a small-time drug operation.  Jim was forced to heave a bag of marijuana into a cornfield as some cops approached, leaving Pork in a difficult position with the people he's supposed to supply.  They spend the rest of the novel searching for the drugs in the cornfield.<br />
<br />
Pork turns out to be the estranged son of a local woman named Bessie, who turns out to be a descendant of that long-ago conquistador—or so my best efforts at following the plot suggest. Bessie dreams of a treasure in a cornfield, and enlists her lover Rolf to help her dig in the middle of his field. From time to time, God breaks in with folksy asides, such as, "All over the Midwest, you find people who know I'm here.  Why, there was this woman in Minnesota—you read about her in the grocery-line-kind-of-paper who found Me in her dishwasher, on a scratched plastic Goofy Cup.  And there are other who know there's something going on and so are forever talking aliens."<br />
<br />
Some readers may put down <i>Tin God</i> after they finish reading it and wonder, as I did, "What just happened?"  But at the very least the novel has earned the compliment that some Midwesterners reserve for creative-types: "Well, that sure was dif'rent."<br />

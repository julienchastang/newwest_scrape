Denver&#8217;s Ghost Road Press recently published <I>A Highly Placed Source</I>, the debut novel by Michelle Dally, a former reporter for the <I>Denver Post</I> who shared a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of the Columbine shootings.&nbsp; The novel is a melodrama and, as such, the characters are there to serve the story, a formula that often works for a gripping narrative trip.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in spite of a fast read, this ride stalls.
</p>
<p>
Despite some intriguing ideas, <I>A Highly Placed Source</I> doesn&#8217;t amount to much.&nbsp; God leaves a message in twelve-year-old Peter Banks&#8217; head in reply to his prayer asking whether or not masturbation is okay.&nbsp; After a fight at school and interference from his buffoon lawyer father, Peter winds up getting nationwide coverage for his message from God.&nbsp; Then, in a more interesting twist, Peter relays a second message from God: three confirmations of his presence will occur in one week and there will be two witnesses, which Peter names.&nbsp; During that week, the media and citizens swarm the Banks family and the witnesses.&nbsp; The media and characters behave as expected, right down to the nervous wreck mother and alcoholic reporter.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the book, the mother obsesses about her hair and the reporter, Gail Abernathy, is always drinking, shorthand for guilt and a failed marriage.&nbsp; Her bad behavior, whether it&#8217;s with her son or her impotent married professor/lover, is boring and irritating, such as in this interchanges between Gail and her son: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>It wasn&#8217;t until they were inside the cluttered two-bedroom unit and had shed jackets and poured a bowl of water for Gus, that Dillon let the zinger fly.&nbsp; &#8220;So you&#8217;re just going to get rid of Gus like you did Daddy?&#8221; he asked, petting the dog&#8217;s head with one hand and holding the other out in the general direction he figured his dad was in. 
<br />
       It was then that Gail rose to fish the bottle of scotch out of the garbage where she had thrown it two days before.&nbsp; She poured herself another.
<br />
       &#8220;Sweetie, I didn&#8217;t &#8216;get rid&#8217; of your father.&nbsp; We both decided to get a divorce,&#8221; she said, knocking back three fingers of amber liquid and pouring herself another. </p></blockquote>
<p>
Because of Dally&#8217;s reporter background, I looked forward to her portrayal of a newsroom, specifically a Denver one, but it&#8217;s the same place we&#8217;ve seen in countless movies and television shows.&nbsp; Maybe newsrooms are clich&#233;, but Dally could have found what is unique in this one.&nbsp; Instead, we hear reporters&#8217; silly conversations about the unnecessary media build-up over potential Y2K problems, and the generator and forty gallons of water still in one reporter&#8217;s garage.&nbsp; Gail passes out on her keyboard and instead of an interesting exchange with a co-worker, no one reacts.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The one detail that felt Denver specific is that the managing editor threatens to send Gail to cover obits in Greeley.&nbsp; Dally&#8217;s reporter background is sometimes felt in annoying ways, such as when she devotes a paragraph to explain Roe vs. Wade, an issue any reader should know, especially in the context in which she uses it.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Ghost Road Press describes <I>A Highly Placed Source</I> as &#8220;always-funny,&#8221; but the humor comes across as whimsical and left me cold.&nbsp; Here is an example of an interaction between Peter Banks and his father, Edward:&nbsp; 
<br />
<blockquote><p>But Edward would not be denied his final summation.&nbsp; &#8220;And if I ever hear you say you&#8217;ve gotten a message from God, Jesus, an angel or even a fucking aardvark, I&#8217;ll send you off to military school so fast your head will spin.&#8221;
<br />
      Peter received his father&#8217;s warning silently, praying first to God and then, as his father&#8217;s words flew by, to Jesus, an angel and then finally an aardvark, that he live through this moment without wetting his pants.&nbsp; His prayer seemed to work, although whether it was the aardvark who managed it, Peter would never know, because he didn&#8217;t wet his pants in front of his ranting father. </p></blockquote>
<p>
Peter is twelve-years-old and at this point in the novel, he had received two messages from God.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t seem likely he would pray to an aardvark or even worry he would wet his pants.&nbsp; This felt like Dally trying to be funny.&nbsp; When humor is done well in fiction, it creates an engaging read and builds the drama, but many instances in this book felt like bad sitcom writing.&nbsp; Although I did enjoy the Banks family pushing &#8220;through the crowd of shouting reporters and hissing Pentecostalists.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Sadly, in a novel that focuses on religion, nothing new or interesting is addressed about religion or spirituality.&nbsp; Some Catholic priests, nicknamed the Men in Black, are out to denounce Peter as a mentally-ill fraud.&nbsp; The mean East Coast bishop thinks of the one good priest as a &#8220;little spic.&#8221; There is talk of a resurrection, but I never bought it.&nbsp; More importantly, I didn&#8217;t believe the character that it impacted bought it; the resurrection idea of her dead son didn&#8217;t cause her pain or more than a sentence&#8217;s thought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Dally plays with the idea of what a miracle is, but the miracles wind up being too small and personal.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to ruin the miracles, but I will say one of them involves a man falling in love with a woman who &#8220;could think and talk and eat as if, well, as if she hadn&#8217;t be programmed by twenty years of Cosmo&#8221; and &#8220;could eat a cheeseburger with gusto.&#8221;  The characters involved with the miracles would not have been brought together if it wasn&#8217;t for Peter&#8217;s announcement from God, but still, it feels trite that God would upset numerous lives, create a media frenzy, and wreck havoc on a boy&#8217;s life for these little miracles.&nbsp; The small, personal miracles could have been fine if the journey was special or interesting enough, but it isn&#8217;t, and the result is a flat, uninspired ending.
</p>
<p>
There are glimmers of what <I>A Highly Placed Source</I> could have been.&nbsp; Peter Banks heard &#8220;a deep voice full of warmth and familiarity, the one he had heard only once.&nbsp; Slowly it spoke to Peter, first asking not to be afraid and then describing in detail what he was to do, what he was to say.&#8221;  After Ricardo Shock, a Geraldo-type television reporter, interviews Peter, the editors manipulate his image to make him look more beatific.&nbsp; He makes the transition from a twelve-year-old to a Christ-type prophet.&nbsp; Even the print reporter, Gail Abernathy, notes that in person his &#8220;eyes did have a sort of shine.&#8221;  Peter is eerily calm and a bit prescient.&nbsp; Dally could have taken this in so many different directions.&nbsp; Yet even Peter Banks, the most promising character, never really changes or is impacted or even that interesting.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a shame, because <I>A Highly Placed Source</I> could have been something special.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As a Colorado native, I wanted to like this book.&nbsp; After all, <I>A Highly Placed Source</I> takes place in Denver, is written by a Denver author, and published by a Denver press.&nbsp; But this story could have taken place anywhere.&nbsp; A few locations and the occasional &#8220;cow town&#8221; reference was all that made it Denver specific.&nbsp; Dally had a good story idea, but the stereotypical characters don&#8217;t surprise or change, and most important, once I closed the book, the story disappeared.&nbsp; Even the use of contemporary events and people&#8212;such as Iraq, 9/11, and Barbara Walters&#8212;dates the story and cheapens its perspective and insight.&nbsp; What could have been an intriguing novel was, in the end, made painfully ordinary.

		<b>Comment By David, 11-19-07</b>
		<p>Sounds perfect for a Lifetime movie of the week.  Seems like a good concept that is lost in the execution.</p>

		<p>I've always appreciated Ms. Younger's reviews..they are right on!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bridgit O'Briety, 12-13-07</b>
		<p>This book sounds like it tries to tackle a very sensitive subject without a very sensitive hand.  It seems to me that the reviewer has given it a lot of thought and could have done a better job with the topic than the author.</p>

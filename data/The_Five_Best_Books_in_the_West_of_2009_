							<p>Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/new_west_best_books_in_the_west_2009_part_1/C39/L39/" title="listed">listed</a> my choices for the notable books of the year from many Western states.&nbsp; I had tremendous fun reading this year, so it was with difficulty that I narrowed down my Best Books in the West list to these five exceptional books.&nbsp; These are the books that I couldn&#8217;t stop talking about, the books I gave to my friends, books from which I read aloud passages to anyone who would listen, the books that kept me up reading late at night&#8212;and speaking as a mom with two kids, ages three and one, I don&#8217;t give up sleep for just any book.&nbsp; And so here they are, my picks for the five best books of the West in 2009:
</p>
<p>
<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/vestal_mcintyres_lake_overturn/C39/L39/" title="Lake Overturn">Lake Overturn</a></I></b> (Harper, 444 pages, $24.99) by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_vestal_mcintyre/C39/L39/" title="Vestal McIntyre">Vestal McIntyre</a>
</p>
<p>
<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/growing_up_illegal_in_denver_helen_thorpes_just_like_us/C39/L39/" title="Just Like Us: The True Story of Four Mexican Girls Coming of Age in America">Just Like Us: The True Story of Four Mexican Girls Coming of Age in America</a></I></b>  (Scribner, 387 pages, $27.99) by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_helen_thorpe/C39/L39/" title="Helen Thorpe">Helen Thorpe</a>
</p>
<p>
I list these two very different books together because I enjoyed them for a similar reason: they both took a community and examined it from top to bottom, revealing the ways the most privileged and destitute people interconnect, and showing the humanity of every person they covered.&nbsp; Vestal McIntyre accomplishes this in the fictional Eula, Idaho (loosely based on his native Nampa), and Helen Thorpe did this for a very real Denver, delivering the most complex, moving, and nuanced portrait of my hometown that I&#8217;ve ever read.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/into_the_woods_ron_carlsons_the_signal/C39/L39/" title="The Signal">The Signal</a></I></b> (Viking, 184 pages, $25.95) by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_ron_carlson_about_the_signal/C39/L39/" title="Ron Carlson">Ron Carlson</a>
</p>
<p>
The latest novel by the great Ron Carlson is as potent and bracing and as a shot of whiskey.&nbsp; Carlson&#8217;s prose is as sharp as it&#8217;s ever been, his themes at once timely and timeless.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t miss <I>The Signal</I>: you can down it in an evening.
</p>
<p>
<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/antonya_nelsons_nothing_right/C39/L39/" title="Nothing Right">Nothing Right</a></I></b> (Bloomsbury USA, 304 pages, $25) by Antonya Nelson
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s been a stellar year for short story collections.&nbsp; I had trouble picking my favorite. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_maile_meloy/C39/L39/" title="Maile Meloy">Maile Meloy</a>&#8216;s  <b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/bad_behavior_maile_meloys_both_ways_is_the_only_way_i_want_it/C39/L39/" title="Both Ways Is The Only Way I Want It">Both Ways Is The Only Way I Want It</a></I></b> is a close second, but I had to give Antonya Nelson the edge because of her terrific sense of humor.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever forget Fanny Mann, a character in the story &#8220;Shauntrelle,&#8221; who relocates temporarily from to Houston from New Orleans to submit herself to a variety of cosmetic surgery procedures.&nbsp; Her face is so often covered in bandages that her roommate doesn&#8217;t really know what she looks like, but Fanny is warm and confessional, and in the end sets out with &#8220;coiffed honey-blond hair&#8221; to claim her new life in a mint-colored Mercedes.&nbsp; Every one of the stories in <I>Nothing Right</I> shares this rich vein of humor.
</p>

<b><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/steven_rinellas_american_buffalo/C39/L39/" title="American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon">American Buffalo: In Search of a Lost Icon</a></I></b> (Spiegel &amp; Grau, 304 pages, $15) by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_steven_rinella/C39/L39/" title="Steven Rinella">Steven Rinella</a>
</p>
<p>
Steven Rinella takes on a classic Western subject in the buffalo with <I>American Buffalo</I> and tackles it with enjoyable insight and humor.&nbsp; I loved this book&#8217;s goofy metaphors, suspenseful hunting scenes, and the buoyant, funny voice of Rinella.&nbsp; His humor even made the serious moments in the book resonate more deeply.&nbsp; Rinella is a tremendous young talent and I look forward to reading whatever he turns his attention to next.&nbsp; (For all you date sticklers out there: I know, I know, this book came out in December 2008.&nbsp; But I didn&#8217;t get to it until this year.)

		<p>I just finished and loved "The Big Burn" by Timothy Egan. For one thing, he is my role model with his economical yet evocative writing. For another, it was packed with great characters, well known (Teddy Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot) and not so well known (Pinkie Adair rocked!!). I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of Idaho and the US Forest Service; to Teddy Roosevelt fans; and to people who are interested in discovering more about exactly when and how the Republican Party - the party of such great progressive centrists as TR and Abe Lincoln - went astray. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions!</p>

		<p>I'm sorry no poetry made it onto your list.  Melissa Kwasny's "Reading Novalis in Montana" is a terrific book--easily my favorite of the year.  It was also named in Huffington Post as one of the top 10 books of the year.  <br />
<br />
Here are a few brief reviews:<br />
"Much of the innovative poetry written in America is published not by the big houses, but by independent presses like Milkweed, and its many smaller siblings. Too often, our poetry is obscure, willfully ignorant of realities beyond the immediate self, and pathetic in its complaint, narcissism, and soullessness. Moreover, the language tends to be prosaic, when it's not self-consciously experimental. Kwasny falls into none of these traps; she writes romantic-environmental poetry of a high order, communing with nature in a language that never sells itself short. Can we imagine ourselves, gluttonous twenty-first century Americans, in a better relationship with nature? Can we see ourselves beyond artificial separations between the animate and the inanimate, between the sensate and the inert? Kwasny shows how, as she refuses to back down under the pressure of material degradation."<br />
–Huffington Post, 10 Best Books of 2009<br />
<br />
<br />
"Surrounded by new books of poems that seem increasingly thin and merely clever, Melissa Kwasny’s work serves as a brilliant tonic, reminding us of the essential gravitas of poems of distinction. Hers present a richly textured surface and a deeply thought interior, and have a compass that deftly mingles the scholarly page with beauticians’ hopes and tobacco pouches; a naturalist’s tight focus with the wide gaze of a woman of the world; a lyricist’s gifts with a philosopher’s understandings. This is the real-deal stuff."<br />
—Albert Goldbarth, author of The Kitchen Sink</p>

		<p>Thanks for that recommendation, Lisa.  I enjoy poetry, but I'm not a good judge of it.  For years I've tried to find a freelancer to review some poetry for New West, but I haven't had any luck.  I've had three or four people say they'll do it, and no one has ever actually turned in a review.  I don't have that problem with prose reviews.  So I'll keep working on that.</p>

Bain' IS for a proven FACT a 'Yew Weh CULT' ( part of the 'Texas and NM Cults )....Dr. Phil has been getting the word out about these Cults and The leaders of said Cults!!!!"  " Remember the show on TV years ago called: ' Justice is blind...but I CAN SEE in the DARK' !!!!!!!"  " WARNING to all that believe in ' Col. Rick H.

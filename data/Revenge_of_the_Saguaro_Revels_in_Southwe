	My heart was hardened against the chimichanga early.&nbsp; In my Denver public elementary school, the cafeteria ladies used to serve chimichangas for Cinco de Mayo and D&#237;a de Independencia on September 16.&nbsp; (I wonder if the same individual is still in charge of holiday menu planning, as DPS officials <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_14176531" title="recently caught flack">recently caught flack</a> for offering students &#8220;Southern Style&#8221; chicken and collard greens &#8220;in Honor Of M.L. King.")  The chimichanga was meant to be festive, but it sat there like a lump on the tray, bathed in a thin, pinkish-beige sauce with chunks in it that so resembled vomit that the effect couldn&#8217;t possibly have been unintentional.
</p>
<p>
	But with his essay collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Revenge-Saguaro-Offbeat-Americas-Southwest/dp/1933693606" title="Revenge of the Saguaro">Revenge of the Saguaro</a></I>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tommillerbooks.com/" title="Tom Miller">Tom Miller</a>, a passionate chimichanga advocate, has convinced me to overcome my prejudices against the fried treat.&nbsp; Miller&#8217;s book, which was originally published as <I>Jack Ruby&#8217;s Kitchen Sink</I> a decade ago, still offers fresh insights about some touchstones of Southwestern culture: chimichangas, saguaro cacti, bola ties, black velvet paintings, &#8220;La Bamba,&#8221; and more.&nbsp; About the only thing Miller left out is an investigation of those brightly painted howling coyote carvings that used to be ubiquitous.
</p>
<p>
In his essay &#8220;Death by Misadventure,&#8221; Miller discusses a cockfight he attended outside of Phoenix.&nbsp; &#8220;Cheerfully tolerating cockfights runs counter to everything civil I like to think I identify with,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;Still, the fact is that I&#8217;ve enjoyed the tackiness of the half-dozen cockfights I&#8217;ve attended in the United States and Mexico: the cigarette-strewn rubble, the pre-match betting, the slice (so to speak) of life&#8212;even, occasionally, the birds going at each other.&#8221;  Tackiness is a beacon for Miller, and he examines his subject in such a descriptive, reflective fashion that even those who find cockfighting off-putting should find reading about it worthwhile.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In one of the best essays, &#8220;Jack Ruby&#8217;s Kitchen Sink,&#8221; Miller dives into the heart of Southwestern tackiness, investigating the origins of black velvet paintings, bola ties, and the chimichanga, or &#8220;chimi&#8221; as the high-calorie treat is affectionately known.&nbsp; &#8220;To see acrylic black velvet at swap meets and flea markets is to appreciate art <I>en su jus</I>,&#8221; Miller writes, &#8220;Elvis Presley.&nbsp; Dogs playing poker.&nbsp; Nudes with arched backs.&nbsp; Bullfights.&nbsp; UFOs.&nbsp; Those are the perennials.&#8221;  Miller traces the black velvet painting to one of its most prolific sources in Tijuana, where he finds a dozen young men painting the Last Supper on black velvet, &#8220;a black-velvet factory.&#8221;  About bola ties, Miller observes, &#8220;The nicest thing about wearing bola ties is that they will never go out of fashion because they never came into it.&#8221;  And he informs readers, &#8220;You know your chimichanga is authentic if an hour after eating it, you feel a log gently rolling around in your stomach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Miller&#8217;s essays move from subject to subject in the manner of a free-form discussion around a guiding theme, so that you never know, based on an essay&#8217;s beginning, where it will take you before it ends.&nbsp; The essay &#8220;Death by Misadventure&#8221; opens with cockfighting, and then moves on to other forms of violence in the Southwest.&nbsp; Miller writes, &#8220;nothing contributes more to Southwestern tradition than violence.&nbsp; We celebrate guns and bombs here&#8230;&#8221;  Miller describes his first experience firing a gun, a patrolman&#8217;s shooting of a Mexican trying to sneak across the border, a visit to the Trinity Site (where the atomic bomb was tested), and concludes with the story of a 1969 shooting in Tucson of some young hippies by the enraged father of a teenage girl who had moved in with them.
</p>
<p>
Miller&#8217;s essays succeed at capturing the Southwest in vivid detail because he&#8217;s an expert at poking around, asking impertinent questions, and going places that many people wouldn&#8217;t venture.&nbsp; One such striking detail occurs in &#8220;The Free State of Cochise,&#8221; in which Miller describes what he discovered when he volunteered to clean up trash left by illegal immigrants in the land along the Arizona border.&nbsp; &#8220;There, sitting in the desert&#8230;I found a gleaming white porcelain toilet bowl.&nbsp; Certainly it was not carried in by immigrants, surely it was carried in by local teens as a joke.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Miller shares a number of great yarns, some of which turn out to be unverifiable legends, such as the truth behind &#8220;El Paso,&#8221; the Marty Robbins &#8220;cowboy ballad.&#8221;  Other stories support the adage that truth is stranger than fiction, as is the case with the incident that inspired the title of the book.&nbsp; In &#8220;Revenge of the Saguaro,&#8221; Miller tells of a hapless man who got drunk and shot at saguaro cacti until one of them dropped a massive limb on him, crushing him to death.&nbsp; Like many of the essays, it manages to be sad and funny at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Miller&#8217;s essays in <I>Revenge of the Saguaro</I> are travel writing of a sort, but they are of a different species entirely than the tips about what posh places to eat at or sleep in that one finds in glossy travel magazines.&nbsp; Instead, Miller offers an insider&#8217;s account of the grit, local gossip, and glorious bad taste that are a part of what endears the Southwest to its residents.&nbsp; And he just might convince you to overcome your food prejudices and head out for a chimichanga.

		<p>The title sounds like a rip off of Revenge of the Lawn.  Is it?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Miller, 3-03-10</b>
		<p>Nope, never heard of that title until I read you post, jed.. “Revenge of the Saguaro” comes from the same-named chapter in the book about a majestic 125-year-old saguaro that crushes its assassin to death – a double homicide, if you will. It’s also an elongated version of the name of the cover art work, “Saguaro’s Revenge.”</p>

							This weekend I saw the young woman who I've mentored for six years graduate from a rigorous prep academy south of Denver.  I am nine months pregnant and the graduation was held outside in ninety-degree heat, but I was determined not to miss this event.  My mentee will be the first in her family to attend college.  She had recently won one of the most generous scholarships available to Colorado students, an award from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danielsfund.org/" title="Daniels Fund">Daniels Fund</a>, which will cover the full cost of her tuition, room and board for four years of college. But I didn't find this out from her—instead the director of the mentoring program sent me an email about it.  I don't regret a moment of the hours I've spent over the years with her, but I have been a little sad during her senior year as she became immersed in finishing school, applying to colleges and scholarships, socializing with her friends, and working, and decided that she had little time for me.  She told me in an email that she'd send me an invitation to her graduation, but she never did.  I showed up anyway. <br />
	<br />
I remember when I met Rotchana at a barbecue held on the same school campus as the graduation.  She was a tiny, elfin twelve-year-old with a very mature way of speaking, boldly engaging me in conversations about current events: "So, what do you think about the Columbus Day controversy?"  The mentoring program that introduced us pairs low income, high-achieving, mostly minority kids with mentors, provides them with academic enrichment through a summer program, and pays their tuition to a private high school.  Although these kids came from low-income families, they were not at all "at-risk"—they were chosen carefully for their academic achievement and commitment to education.  Their families were also interviewed because as most of the students were Latina females, it was important to determine that there was no macho figure discouraging them from pursuing higher education.<br />
<br />
Rotchana was a striking child: sensitive, intelligent, and polite.  Her father, a Mexican immigrant, was not in the picture, and she lived with her mother, aunt, cousin, and great aunt.  She was going to complete seventh and eighth grade at the school she was currently attending before heading to the prep academy for high school.  She went to a Catholic school serving a mostly poor community in north Denver, and as soon as I saw her homework, I knew that something was wrong.  She was always at the top of her class, but her classes were not taught at the appropriate grade level. In math, a subject in which she struggled, they were still working on adding and subtracting fractions.  The prep academy began its math program for freshman with Algebra, and she wouldn't even get a chance to take pre-Algebra.  So in addition to taking her on fun excursions--to see a Christina Aguilera concert, trips to the zoo, the ballet, plays, museums, and movies--I began to come over to her house to tutor her once a week.<br />
<br />
She made improvements in math, but when she entered ninth grade at the prep academy, she felt terribly behind.  All the other girls at the school had taken rigorous courses that had prepared them for the difficulty of the high school curriculum.  I was frustrated because I knew that she was just as smart as the others, and if she had only been taught properly in elementary school, she would be getting just as good grades as they did.  Our tutoring sessions became more intense, and I worried about her.  The school was a 45 minute drive each way for her, so she arrived with much less sleep than the others.  Most of the students were wealthy and white, and she quickly ran into trouble with some snobs who made life difficult for her during her entire high school career.  After making the long trek home from school, she worked on homework for hours until she fell asleep and then begin the process again the next day.  Despite her diligence she was still in danger of failing several classes.  <br />
<br />
Her personality change--she became less open and more frequently angry.  Her best friend at school, another Mexican-American girl from north Denver, decided to quit and go to a school closer to home.  I made Rotchana go over all her Algebra homework with me every Wednesday, and I could feel her anger at me when I made her do some problems over, or when I didn't know how to work a problem.  She was working so hard on her schoolwork that she didn't have any time to participate in sports and clubs and other activities that make high school fun.  I was telling her that this was good for her, that going to this school far away from home that was full of rich white bitches was the best thing for her future, but I really didn't know if that was true.  I lost plenty of sleep over it, but ultimately it was her decision, and she chose to stick it out.<br />
<br />
After she made it through that first year, she began to grow stronger, academically and personally.  She repeated Algebra, and with the help of a wonderful teacher, she became one of the top students in that class, and in all the math classes she would take from then on.  Her writing, which was always good, became excellent.  The only thing her teachers told me during conferences that she should work on was her class participation--she didn't speak up much, because members of the reigning clique were always quick to shoot her down when she talked.  In response, she had become more and more interested in the Latino culture of her neighborhood, dressing like the kids there instead of those at her school, making friends around home, and listening to reggaetón and Spanish language hip-hop instead of the blander music favored by her classmates.<br />
<br />
During her sophomore year, we decided that her grades were so good that she didn't need academic help from me anymore.  Apart from occasionally looking over an essay that she emailed me, we stuck to fun activities from then on.  I was amazed to see this girl, who had been a skinny little kid still playing with Barbie dolls when I met her, mature into a beautiful and confident young woman.  <br />
<br />
This past school year, however, she grew more distant.  She didn't answer my emails very often, and when I tried to get her to commit to meeting up to see a movie or go get our toenails painted, she always said she was busy.  And she probably was—she had to apply to college, do her homework, work on scholarship applications and keep an after school job.  But it still hurt that she wouldn't make any time for me.  Her school devoted a lot of resources and time to assist with applications and SAT tests, so the only help she asked me for was to look over a few of her scholarship essays.  I sent her checks for her birthday and Christmas to help her save money for college, and I found out that she received them only when she cashed them.  She'd always sent me prompt thank you notes before.<br />
<br />
As I await the birth of my daughter, I feel like I've had something of a preview of what the teenage years for girls can be like, how prickly they can become, and how their cool reserve can make you feel like you are a blathering idiot, always saying and doing exactly the wrong thing.  Somehow I doubt I'll be able to manage my daughter's teenage years with any more grace than I did those of my mentee.  All you want is to continue to maintain the connection and closeness that you've shared for years, and all they want to do is push away and prove to you that they are independent young adults now.  <br />
<br />
And I guess that's the point of mentoring after all--she's heading off to college in the fall with a full scholarship that she earned through four years of hard work, and she can major in any subject she chooses without worrying about having to pay off debt from college loans.  She's in control now, and any future she desires is hers to make or lose.  Whether she knows it or not, I'll be in the background somewhere, rooting for her.<br />

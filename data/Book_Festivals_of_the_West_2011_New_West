		<h1>Book Festivals of the West 2011</h1>
		<h2><i>Our comprehensive map and rundown on where and when literary festivals are happening throughout the West, from Oregon to New Mexico and lots of places in between.</i></h2>

							<p>Each year readers and writers gather to celebrate the written word at book festivals, fairs, and writing conferences throughout the West. Although there are a few spring festivals, everything really begins to pick up in June, and the schedule remains busy through November. 
</p>
<p>
The offerings vary from those that concentrate on helping writers improve their craft, such as the Lighthouse Writers Workshop&#8217;s retreat in Grand Lake, Colo. (July 10th-15th), to those that introduce writers to readers through panels, readings, and book signings, such as the Montana Festival of the Book in Missoula (October 5th-7th). Some, such as the Aspen Summer Words Festival (June 19th-24th), combine workshops and readings. The workshops charge fees, but plenty of the festivals are free to attend, including the Montana Festival of the Book in Missoula and the Equality State Book Fair in Casper. Most workshops are already accepting applications for this year.

I&#8217;ve updated the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;t=p&amp;source=embed&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=109864451676542356570.00048cdfa41fc11128875" title="Book Festivals of the West map">Book Festivals of the West map</a> with this year&#8217;s information when it was available. Please let me know if there are any more events to add or update&#8212;I&#8217;ll even throw this open for events in California and Texas. New West will run reports from the festivals again this year&#8212;we already have correspondents lined up for the Jackson Hole Writers Conference, Aspen Summer Words, and the Montana Festival of the Book, and are looking for more contributors.

<p>
&#8226; I am light on news for this week&#8217;s roundup, but I have this one note: even before Patrick DeWitt&#8217;s new novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_sisters_brothers_updates_a_classic_western_novel_scenario/C39/L39/" title="The Sisters Brothers">The Sisters Brothers</a></I> was published, actor John C. Reilly&#8217;s production company optioned it. Reilly will produce and star as Eli, the loveable murderous brother, which seems a great fit.

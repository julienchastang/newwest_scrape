		<h1>Boulder&#8217;s Disappearing Middle Class</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">

							In two informative articles in Monday's <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, Bill Scanlon reported on Boulder's growing population of people living in poverty (<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4407709,00.html" title=""Poverty on the rise in Boulder"">"Poverty on the rise in Boulder"</a> and <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4407684,00.html" title=""One Boulder worker's story: She couldn't afford life there"">"One Boulder worker's story: She couldn't afford life there"</a>).  As Scanlon writes, "Tucked behind the mansions, not far from the BMWs, one in seven people here live in poverty.   That's a rate equal to Denver and Aurora, twice as high as Lakewood or Longmont, three times higher than Arvada, and five times higher than Boulder's neighbor, Louisville."  With the median sales price for a single-family home hitting $500,000, even many college educated people are slipping into poverty in Boulder, and the middle class is quickly disappearing.

		<b>Comment By Waylon H. Lewis, 1-24-06</b>
		<p>So true--amen to one of the most underreported stories of the often-wonderful experiment that is Boulder. I'm looking to buy my first place, and the floor is 400K--that'll get me a 900 sq ft dilapidated cottage in need of total renovation with a yard big enough to throw a frisbee--to yourself. And every time I put in a bid, a developer's there before me--they raze ('scrape') the place, whatever it's historic value, or 'pop the top,' or do whatever they have to do to flip the property for 650K or 850K or 1.5 million...changing what was barely within reach for someone earning 25K to something barely within reach for someone earning 100K. <br />
<br />
What to do about it? No one seems to have any ideas, but for the City, who does what they can to protect such props from such careless, un-eco, $$$-centered demo-lopers.<br />
<br />
Yrs.,<br />

		<p>I've been thinking a lot about this too. I give credit to the City of Boulder, who have been coming up with some solutions, as the Rocky Mtn. news article pointed out. I live in the Maplelton Mobile home park - <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mapletonhomeassoc.org">http://www.mapletonhomeassoc.org</a> - which is owned by Thistle Community Housing. The operations of the park are overseen by residents of the park itself. Thistle received much in the way of grants from the city, and other agencies, to be able to buy the land that the park sits on - prime real-estate in Boulder by any measure, where the houses that Waylon mentions in the next street over are going for the "low 470's". Lot rents in the park are set in relationship to the AMI that one sits in, and if you make too much money, you can't live here.  It's clear that in a place like Boulder, without some forward thinking like the city enabled, you would see unaffordable houses everywhere, and the land where I live would be replaced by Condos. So the City has done something good here, and by selling the park they have 'upped' the number of affordable units in Boulder, by about 174...I'm not a huge proponent of social engineering, either...it's a complicated problem. What I do know is that I'm thankful to still be living in Boulder since I love the town, the bike paths, the access to the mountains...but it's difficult to realize that I'll probably never be able to afford one of those nice houses on the hilltops. <br />

		<p>Right subject; wrong articles.  The latter are more about the poverty (lower) class than the middle one.  Had they been about someone, say making $60,000 per yr., that would be middle class.  Had they been about that person not being able to afford a $500,000 50 yr old 1100 sf bungalow with one run down bathroom, that would have been a middle class story.  The middle class is indeed disappearing in Boulder and elsewhere, and that's part of the ruling elite Republican plan.  But they want to keep as many poor people around as possible, whether they're in trailers or subsidized housing.  Who else is going to blow the leaves off their lawns?</p>

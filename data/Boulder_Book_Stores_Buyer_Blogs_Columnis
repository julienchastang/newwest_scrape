							<p>Lately the <a target="_blank" href="http://boulderbookstore.com/" title="Boulder Book Store's">Boulder Book Store&#8217;s</a> website has been pointing to the blog of its head book buyer, Arsen Kashkashian.&nbsp; I started reading <a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/" title="Kash's Book Corner">Kash&#8217;s Book Corner</a> and am now addicted&#8212;he doesn&#8217;t update as frequently as some literary bloggers, but each post is a carefully reasoned, well-written essay, packed with interesting tidbits and insights into the world of independent book stores.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
For example, in his recent post &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/2008/01/hachette-takes-hatchet-to-indies.html" title="Hachette Takes a Hatchet to Indies">Hachette Takes a Hatchet to Indies</a>,&#8221; he wrote about his attempt to order six copies of Ron Patterson&#8217;s new novel <I>Sail</I>.&nbsp; &#8220;My rep informed me that if I ordered six copies of the Patterson book,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t get them in time for the national laydown date. The only books that Hachette will send out on time are those that are ordered in carton quantities.&#8221;  Kashkashian reluctantly raised his order to one carton (ten copies) so that the book would be available on its release date for the half-dozen or so Patterson fans who shop at the Boulder Book Store.
</p>
<p>
So the perennial national bestseller Ron Patterson doesn&#8217;t do well in Boulder, and he and other authors like him leave independent bookstores with a dilemma, wanting to order enough copies to satisfy their customers, but trying to avoid going broke doing it.
</p>
<p>
I also enjoyed Kashkashian&#8217;s post about <a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/2008/01/bargain-shopping.html" title="the after-holiday sale at the Boulder Book Store">the after-holiday sale at the Boulder Book Store</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My favorite shoppers were the ones looking for the super discounts. They trolled through the remainders and used books, looking for the deal of the year on books that were already absurdly cheap. We even had a number of customers down on their hands and knees wading through our used book markdowns that normally sell for one to three dollars&#8230; Let&#8217;s face it, most of our customers could easily afford everything they were buying at full price.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As someone who has been known to get on my hands and knees and grovel for books, I recognized myself in this portrait.&nbsp; Also check Kashkashian&#8217;s post &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/2007/12/boulders-reading-dna.html" title="Boulder's Reading DNA">Boulder&#8217;s Reading DNA</a>,&#8221; about the books that have sold well recently in Boulder.&nbsp; Heck, just subscribe to <a target="_blank" href="http://kashsbookcorner.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss" title="his RSS feed">his RSS feed</a> and be done with it.&nbsp; This is one quality book blog.
</p>
<p>
Another quality Colorado book columnist whom I&#8217;ve mentioned before is David Milofsky, who writes the &#8220;Bookbeat&#8221; for the Denver Post.&nbsp; This week he detailed some amusing, irate responses he&#8217;s received from readers to his column over the past year (&#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_8133823" title="Judging by letters, somebody's reading">Judging by letters, somebody&#8217;s reading</a>&#8221;).&nbsp; One hot-button topic for him is Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s understandable that whenever I write about any of Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper&#8217;s initiatives in the arts, there is reaction, some of it unprintable.
</p>
<p>
An anonymous staffer, for instance, objected when I characterized Wesleyan University, the mayor&#8217;s alma mater, as &#8220;sub-Ivy,&#8221; but hizzoner was amused, which speaks well for him.
</p>
<p>
And when I criticized his choice of Chris Ransick as city poet laureate, the response was immediate with letters to me, as well as to the editor, calling again for my dismissal, which seems to be a common theme.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Finally, there are several Las Vegas novels hitting bookstores these days, making it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/in_search_of_the_literature_of_the_urban_west/C39/L39/" title="one western city that doesn't lack for literary chroniclers">one western city that doesn&#8217;t lack for literary chroniclers</a>.&nbsp; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beautifulchildren.net/" title="Beautiful Children">Beautiful Children</a></I>, the first novel by Charles Bock, is getting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/books/review/Schillinger2-t.html?ref=books" title="scads">scads</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/magazine/27Bock-t.html?ref=review" title="of attention">of attention</a>, and the first novel by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joemcginnissjr.com/" title="Joe McGinniss Jr.">Joe McGinniss Jr.</a>, <I>The Delivery Man</I>, also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Park-t.html" title="garnered a prompt review in the New York Times">garnered a prompt review in the New York Times</a>, which can be hard to come by for some Western writers.

		<b>Comment By Terry Belcoe, 8-24-08</b>
		<p>I'm sorry if this is the wrong format for this but I have a first edition "The Old Man And The Sea"  I want to sell.  I'm a 51 year old poet\ songwriter who has never let anything Ive written be published but due to an injury would like to now release some but need to finance myself for a while to write more and thought my Hemingway might help my efforts.  Are there any auction houses you might suggest.  Say maybe in Ketchum or Key West, perhaps you know a collector.  Please forgive my intrusion if this is totally out of line.   Terry</p>

		<p>I&lt;A &gt;'&lt;/A&gt;m sure many of you are like me and one of the first things you do in the morning is head here and check out the new post.  Along with seeing the new posts, I'm also always checking out the blog roll rss feed and watching them grow, or shrink sometimes.  In one of my past ...but all in all excellent site.   Keep it up!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By HenleyL, 10-12-09</b>
		<p>Hey, I really enjoy your blog.  I have a blog too in a totally unrelated field &lt;A &gt;(Online Stock Trading)&lt;/A&gt; but I like to check in here on a regular basis, just to see what's going on and it's always interesting to say the least.  It's always entertaining what people have to say.</p>

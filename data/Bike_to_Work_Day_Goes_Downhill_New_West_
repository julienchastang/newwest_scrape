							The women monitoring the breakfast station at the Wild Oats headquarters on Mitchell Lane begrudgingly surrendered meager amounts of food to bikers this morning. They hovered over the chafing dish that held butchered, lukewarm breakfast burritos, cutting them into successively smaller portions, and used tongs to dole out a bite-sized pittance to each new arrival who held out a plate.  â€œCan I have two?â€? one man asked.  â€œNo,â€? the woman said.  The man recoiled as if she had just barked â€œNo soup for you!â€?  Barely an hour into the two-hour event, the woman explained, â€œweâ€™re running out.â€? With such a pitiful display at a breakfast station that was once one of the Valhallas of the program, it was clear this morning that Bike to Work Dayâ€™s finest hour has passed.  Sure, it was free, but so is a kick in the face.<br />
<br />
Each year in June, several local businesses and organizations sponsor Bike to Work Week to encourage people to try alternative transportation for their morning commute.  The event culminates in Bike to Work Day, and free breakfast is offered to all cyclists on their morning commutes at dozens of locations across Boulder. <br />
<br />
Last year at the same station I visited this morning, people were allowed to help themselves to a full breakfast, unmonitored. The tables were laden with fresh bagels, muffins, fruit and juice. There was another table full of free, full-sized products that people were encouraged to hoardâ€”bottles of chai, soy drinks, juices, sparkling beverages, granola bars, lip balm. People lingered outside on the beautiful morning, flushed from their exercise, chatting with strangers.  <br />
<br />
This year, there was one platter of baked goods, all of which were chopped into bits so tiny as to render them unidentifiableâ€”it was impossible to distinguish between the crumbled morsels of scone, bagel, and muffin.  The small table of free samples consisted almost entirely of little packets of some type of unappealing health cereal or trail mix that looked like twigs.  I saw several people pick up the packets, shake them, and put them back.  <br />
<br />
Bike to Work Day breakfast stations have long been hit-or-miss, and fans of the event share tips on the best breakfast locations with each other.  Whole Foods is always so swamped that you risk losing a limb when trying to grab some food, but other locations achieved legendary statusâ€”Moeâ€™s Bagels once offered a lavish spread, and the Wild Oats on Baseline reputedly gave free, full plates of steaming pancakes and sausage to all comers.<br />
<br />
For some reason, the decline of Bike to Work Day seemed to hold ominous portent for the local economy.  â€œI guess the â€˜90s are over,â€? one participant commented.  When I pointed out that the â€˜90s ended five years ago, he said, â€œYeah, but last year it was like it was still a hangover from the â€˜90s.  Now everyone is cutting back.â€?<br />
<br />
I used to love Bike to Work Day, participating even when I had no reason to leave the house, and as I chewed my small lump of breakfast burrito, I felt a little sad to see it come to this.  Maybe it was the unity of the event that I enjoyed, everyone happily riding bikes and freeloading together on one day a year.  Or perhaps it was the patriotism: the breakfast stations used to be so American, allowing you to help yourself to all you could eat.  But as people whoâ€™d counted on a decent breakfast gnawed on tiny chunks of scone all around me, it was clear that the golden age of freeloading in the name of alternative transport has come to an unceremonious end.

		<p>I think you missed the point of Bike to Work day...by a long shot. I stopped at the breakfast station hosted by the Colorado Group at 47th and Colorado, enjoying a few snacks, good company and a chair massage. I ride my bike by this same spot everyday on my way to work, so it was a nice surprise to stop today and be rewarded for commuting in something other than a car. Your view of "everyone happily riding bikes and freeloading together on one day a year," is so absurd that I think you may be pulling everyone's leg. Am I right?<br />

		<p>Yep, I'm guilty of leg-pulling--I was hoping my tone would indicate that, but I'll clarify just in case.  I thought it was interesting that certain breakfast stations have built reputations among cyclists who participate every year, and I found it amusing that some people I spoke to were let down when they compared this year's breakfast to previous experiences, because, after all, it's a free, fun, community building event.</p>

		<p>Jenny, I clearly saw your tongue in your cheek. Thank you for putting it there. I got one hell of a good laugh out of it. Great piece.</p>

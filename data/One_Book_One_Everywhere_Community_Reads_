							<p>In recent years, many towns throughout the Rocky Mountain region have launched community reading programs, designed to unite as many people as possible in reading and discussing the same book.&nbsp; There&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.montanabook.org/onebook.htm" title="One Book, One Montana">One Book, One Montana</a>, which chose <I>The Last Crossing</I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Vanderhaeghe" title="Guy Vanderhaeghe">Guy Vanderhaeghe</a> in 2007, One Book Billings, which has selected <I>Waking Lazarus</I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tlhines.com/" title="T. L. Hines">T. L. Hines</a> for 2008, and Salt Lake&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slcreads.com/" title="SLC Reads Together">SLC Reads Together</a>, which is featuring <I>Angle of Repose</I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Stegner" title="Wallace Stegner">Wallace Stegner</a> this winter.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As a part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregon150.org/oregon-stories/" title="Oregon Sesquicentennial Project">Oregon Sesquicentennial Project</a> for 2009, the Oregon Library Association has announced they will focus on three books&#8212;one each for kids, young adults, and adults.&nbsp; Boise has reading programs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idahokidsread.org/" title="for kids">for kids</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thecabinidaho.org/" title="adults">adults</a>, and last year the Log Cabin Literary Center&#8217;s Big Read featured <i>A Farewell To Arms</i> by Ernest Hemingway, a classic author with an Idaho connection.
</p>
<p>
According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html#MULTI-STATE,%20REGIONAL,%20OR%20NATIONWIDE" title="the Library of Congress">the Library of Congress</a>, every state in the Rocky Mountain region has initiated these reading programs, although some have been more successful and long-lived than others. 
</p>
<p>
Rocky Mountain News Books Editor Patti Thorn recently gave <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/02/thorn-one-book-work-in-progress/" title="some thoughtful and extensive suggestions for improving the One Book, One Denver program">some thoughtful and extensive suggestions for improving the One Book, One Denver program</a>.&nbsp; Participation in the program, measured in books sold, books taken out from the library, and event attendance, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/02/by-the-numbers/" title="has decreased since its inception in 2004">has decreased since its inception in 2004</a>, when Leif Enger&#8217;s <I>Peace Like A River</I> was featured.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Thorn suggested, in part, that the program follow the model of Seattle&#8217;s, which launched the community reading craze across the country.&nbsp; Politicians including Mayor Hickenlooper vet the list of titles in Denver&#8217;s program, weeding out any book that could be controversial or inappropriate for highschoolers.&nbsp; Some books are passed up because of sex scenes (as was Kent Haruf&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I>).&nbsp; According to Thorn, Chris Hagashi, program manager for the Washington Center for the Book at the Seattle Public Library, makes Seattle&#8217;s selection based on her personal instincts and welcomes books that will prompt heated debate.
</p>
<p>
I recently spoke to Kent Haruf about his project with photographer Peter Brown, <I>West of Last Chance</I> (check back here on March 7 to read the full interview).&nbsp; We also discussed Thorn&#8217;s article, and he agreed with me that the most recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/Default.aspx?alias=www.denvergov.org/onebook" title="One Book, One Denver">One Book, One Denver</a> selection, <I>Articles of War</I> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_nick_arvin/C39/L39/" title="by Nick Arvin">by Nick Arvin</a>, was an excellent book.&nbsp; &#8220;All of the choices have been pretty good,&#8221; Haruf said, &#8220;but they need to figure out how to do it better than they&#8217;ve been doing it, so it can get the attention it deserves.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Haruf mentioned that the program&#8217;s refusal to select <I>Plainsong</I> &#8220;is water under the bridge at this point,&#8221; and that the book has been featured by many other cities and towns across the country in their community reading programs.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My complaint would be that the mayor&#8217;s office has some final say on it,&#8221; Haruf said.&nbsp; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a dangerous thing, always, to have politics involved in the determination of what&#8217;s art and what art should be available to the public.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/09/thorn-one-book-so-many-opinions/" title="Thorn ran a follow-up article">Thorn ran a follow-up article</a> featuring emails she&#8217;d received with suggestions for the program, including one from a local author who suggested they switch from fiction to non-fiction, and while they&#8217;re at it, choose her book. 
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s no indication that Hickenlooper plans to heed any of Thorn&#8217;s suggestions yet&#8212;we&#8217;ll have to wait until next year to see if there&#8217;s a change in plans for One Book, One Denver.&nbsp; I have to give them credit for supporting the program at all, even if interest has declined.&nbsp; And at least Denver&#8217;s program hasn&#8217;t made a blunder like the Salt Lake County one did last year, when it invited Mark Spragg to present <I>An Unfinished Life</I> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/salt_lake_city_librarians_diss_mark_spragg/C39/L39/" title="and then rescinded the invitation">and then rescinded the invitation</a>.

		<p>"One Book, One Denver"?  Huh. I'm not sure that could have less of a ring to it.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of everyone reading a book no one else is reading. You have to register your choice at a website, and if someone else chose the book you want to read, well, I'm sorry, you have to pick something else. That would be a program I could support.<br />
<br />
Also, I think maybe the secret reason Spragg's book got dumped is because it sucks.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 2-28-08</b>
		<p>Hi Garth,<br />
<br />
Sucks, huh?  That's exactly the sort of feisty response these community reading program organizers should be looking for.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of Enger's "Peace Like A River," the first year's choice.  It was a little too cute for me.  And I  couldn't buy the way the little sister acted and wrote like she was forty years old.  I know a lot of people love that book, though, so they'll probably come after me with pitchforks.<br />
<br />
And what would you call your individual reader program?  One Book, One Guy Sitting At Home Alone?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Garth, 2-28-08</b>
		<p>Hi Jenny,<br />
<br />
Yeah, it sucks.<br />
<br />
I hadn't thought of a name for my program. You're got me on that one. "Two Million Books, Two Million Denvers"?<br />
<br />
We were supposed to learn by watching Juno that it is totally plausible for a teen to be wise beyond her years, still not use a condom during sex, and talk like she's forty.<br />
<br />
But -- I'm with you on that one.<br />
<br />
[I almost wrote: "wide beyond her years"]</p>

							<p>I was in France this month, and went the big <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnac" title="FNAC">FNAC</a> (kind of like a Tower Records and Barnes &amp; Noble combined) in Paris to check out what American writers are popular there.&nbsp; The only Western American book that I saw featured prominently this time was Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s <I>The Road</I>, which is called <I>La Route</I>.&nbsp; It somehow doesn&#8217;t seem right to call that book &#8220;La&#8221; anything.&nbsp; The film <I>No Country for Old Men</I> was playing at several movie theaters in central Paris, and they left that title un-translated.&nbsp; Probably because the English version is catchier than &#8220;Ce n&#8217;est aucun pays pour de vieux hommes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I was out of town for a few weeks, and came back to learn of yet another fake memoir scandal.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve probably heard all about this by now, but it involves a regional writer, so I feel obliged to mention it: Eugene, Oregon resident Margaret Seltzer made headlines a few weeks ago when her &#8220;memoir,&#8221; <I>Love and Consequences</I>, published by Riverhead Books under the name Margaret B. Jones, was yanked from stores after everyone figured out that it was entirely fabricated.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/books/04fake.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin" title="Mokoto Rich of the New York Times">Mokoto Rich of the New York Times</a>, Jones wrote in the book about &#8220;her life as a half-white, half-Native American girl growing up in South-Central Los Angeles as a foster child among gang-bangers, running drugs for the Bloods.&nbsp; In reality, she&#8217;s all white, comes from an affluent family, and was never a foster child or a member of a gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
As long as memoirs remain more popular with readers and easier to sell to publishers than novels, there will probably continue to be revelations like this one.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a question for you to discuss among yourselves: If you could write a fake memoir, what sort of fake life would you create?&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t be a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/garden/28jones.html?ref=books" title="gangbanger">gangbanger</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0104061jamesfrey1.html" title="drug addict">drug addict</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/books/03arts-HOLOCAUSTMEM_BRF.html?ref=arts" title="holocaust survivor">holocaust survivor</a>, as three recently deposed memoirists have claimed to be.&nbsp; I&#8217;d be something a little more fun: maybe a cowgirl.
</p>
<p>
On a happier note, <I>Migration Patterns</I> by Colorado writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fulcrum-books.com/contributorinfo.cfm?ContribID=4843" title="Gary Schanbacher">Gary Schanbacher</a> received an honorable mention this month for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pen-ne.org/news/archives/cat_awards.html" title="2008 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award">2008 Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award</a> (which was won by Joshua Ferris&#8217;s <I>Then We Came to the End</I>).&nbsp; The award honors &#8220;a distinguished first book of fiction.&#8221;  Check out our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/flight_risks_gary_schanbachers_migration_patterns/C132/L39/" title="review of Schanbacher's fine book here">review of Schanbacher&#8217;s fine book here</a>.&nbsp;

Thorn also recently wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/mar/05/thorn-contest-boosts-authors-high-hopes/" title="a very kind article about my novel">a very kind article about my novel</a>, which, as I mentioned last month, was a semi-finalist for the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t make it to the finals&#8212;voting for the top 10 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=332264011" title="continues here ">continues here </a>through the end of the month.&nbsp; But I did get Thorn&#8217;s great article out of it, and it&#8217;s now prominently featured on my parents&#8217; refrigerator.&nbsp; Under the pictures of the grandkids, of course.

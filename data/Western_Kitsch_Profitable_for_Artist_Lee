							As an avid coupon clipper and bargain shopper, I look forward to the coupon inserts in my Sunday paper with an eagerness usually reserved for people twice my age.  Coupons are not the only enticement in these inserts, however: Interspersed between savings offers from Frito-Lay and Proctor & Gamble is an array of products for sale.  There are the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-300063002.jsp?so+truly+real+dolls&endeca=true" title="creepy, "anatomically correct" premature baby dolls">creepy, "anatomically correct" premature baby dolls</a>, NASCAR commemorative dinner plates, Thomas Kinkaid collectibles, one-size-fits-all slacks, housedresses, and even utilitarian-looking bras.  I know that I shouldn’t judge the Sunday coupon insert as a venue for tasteful art or high fashion, but the other day I saw an advertisement for one statuette that was an example of Western kitsch so egregious I had to investigate it.  The ad from The </a><a target="_blank" href="http://ashtondrake.collectiblestoday.com/ct/store/ad?cm_ven=Search&cm_cat=Google&cm_pla=Performics&cm_ite=Keyword" title="Ashton-Drake Galleries">Ashton-Drake Galleries</a> hawked “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.collectiblestoday.com/ct/product/prdid-300456001.jsp?_Ashton-Drake/_prod/_87/_/_/_/_&endeca=true&abbr=ad" title="Soul Mates">Soul Mates</a>: Inspired by the Art of Lee Bogle,” featuring two native American lovers standing back-to-back, clad in skimpy buckskin, the man stripped to the waist, the woman wearing a dress that barely covered the subject.  <br />
<br />
In forming the figures’ faces, Ashton-Drake had toned down the ethnic qualities that were apparent in the inset from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bnr-art.com/bogle/soulmates.htm" title="the original painting">the original painting</a>—the strong cheekbones and noses were rendered cute and pert, resulting in a sort of a Barbie-and-Ken-play-Indian look. The Ashton-Drake people prefer to refer to them as “Lovers United by Destiny.”<br />
<br />
Even more titillating were the insets of the two figurines that subscribers to the “Power and Passion of Lee Bogle” collection would receive next: In both, the woman has lost her buckskin dress, and instead is clutching the sumptuous fur of some Western animal to her bosom, a fur that is conveniently just long enough to barely shield her nether parts from the prurient eyes of whoever happens to purchase her for $29.99, plus shipping and handling.  The man has retained his buckskin loincloth in one, forfeited it in the next, as now his luscious lady is positioned in such a way to cover his manhood.  It appears that the figures will wear fewer and fewer items of clothing as the series continues, so that figures 4 and 5 will no longer be tame enough for advertisement in the Sunday coupon insert.  It is impossible to tell if figures 2 and 3 are depicting the lovers in a state that is pre-coital, mid-coital, or post-coital, but whatever they’re doing, it’s hot and steamy.  And Western, oh so hot and Western, with buckskin, beads, and fur.<br />
<br />
I am not Native American, but if I were, I imagine I would either be deeply offended or profoundly amused by “Soul Mates.”  I Googled around for info on the artist, Lee Bogle, and discovered that he is from Kirkland, Washington, and spent twenty years teaching art to Junior and Senior high school students, who no doubt influenced his choice of subject matter with their raging hormones.  Judging from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.onlineartmall.com/limited/leebogle/" title="Bogle's photo">Bogle's photo</a>, he’s an affable, older gentleman who is apparently white.  I could find nothing that explained his interest in Native American subjects, but I did find evidence that this focus has been a lucrative one for him.  His artwork is for sale through numerous venues, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bnr-art.com/bogle/originals.htm" title="one website">one website</a> featured paintings of his that sold for between $1,855 and $6,260.  Also, he’s apparently expanded his repertoire of sexy, black-haired ethnic women to include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bnr-art.com/bogle/orig-floresdelaeleganc.htm" title="the depiction of Latinas.">the depiction of Latinas.</a>.<br />
<br />
Just who will buy the figurines in the “Soul Mates” series is a question I have pondered for weeks now.  Mid-western fetishizers of the Western?  Recent arrivals to the West who want to give their new houses that Western artistic touch?  Or people who collect anything and will place the chest-heaving couple on their shelves between porcelain pug figurines and accurate replicas of premature babies?  I doubt the mystery will ever be revealed to me, but that won’t prevent me from seeking answers.  For insight I turn to the words of the immortal artist Lee Bogle, who explains, "There's a spirituality in my art that the viewer must interpret for himself. Frequently I paint women whose faces are turned upwards, toward the sky. Many times their eyes are closed, as if in peaceful contemplation. I want my paintings to express a depth of serenity that comes only with inner peace.” Yeah, with inner peace, or a good Western-style shagging.<br />

		<b>Comment By Sherri Bogle, 8-09-06</b>
		<p>Dear Jenny,<br />
<br />
How sad for you, that you look at the work of my husband in such a distorted manner, as lustful rather than beautiful human and spiritual emotion.  You dare to judge the intentions of someone whom you have never met.  You have no idea of the wonderful heart of this man.  This is really very shabby "journalism".</p>
		
		<b>Comment By J H, 12-06-06</b>
		<p>I agree with Sherri, Mr. Bogle's art work is very beautiful. It's not lustful in the least. You may say it is sensual, which does not mean it is "dirty". Bogle has captured the essence of emotion between a man and a woman.  I find it tastefully done. I am glad Ashton Drake has made these pieces available and will be purchasing them when I can. To Mrs. Bogle; I love your husband's work. He is a very talented man.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Annie, 7-31-09</b>
		<p>Mr. Bogle is a wonderfully talented artist. Love is the most sacred of human emotions, and his pictures are full of it. This Jenny is either a prude or a very bitter person to make nasty comments about an artist who brings beauty to people's life.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Colleen, 1-05-10</b>
		<p>I am not only receiving Lee Bogle's "Power & Passion" Figurine Collection, but I wait with anticipation for each new piece as they arrive. I see on the news, and in the lives around me, of people searching for peace, but only finding hate, rage, divorce, etc... Lee Bogle has created a Beautiful Collection which radiates the Love and Hope that I only dream of seeing in a true relationship. The Only reason that I could possibly find for someone to find fault with this Wonderful work of art, is either they are a Religious Prudes, or they are Jealous of something they are searching for and cannot find. Thank You Lee Bogle, and let me know when your next collection begins. And... God Bless you!</p>

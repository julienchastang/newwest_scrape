		<h1>Why I Don&#8217;t Own An EReader&#8230;Yet</h1>

							<p>It seems like all the news from publishers these days is somehow eReader related, but there was a disturbing incident here in Colorado a few weeks ago that set me to thinking about why I don&#8217;t yet feel any desire to purchase an eReader.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
On April 20, <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/23205042/detail.html" title="surveillance cameras">surveillance cameras</a> at the Cherry Creek Mall in Denver captured a terrible crime.&nbsp; Aurora&#8217;s Bill Jordan purchased an iPad at the Apple Store, and then wound the string of the bag around his pinky finger.&nbsp; A man followed Jordan, and as he left the mall, snatched the bag from Jordan&#8217;s hands, taking a good portion of his pinky finger along with it.&nbsp; On April 24, Denver Police apprehended a suspect, Brandon Smith, and on April 28, the Denver District Attorney&#8217;s Office <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14976914" title="charged him with robbery and third-degree assault">charged him with robbery and third-degree assault</a>.
</p>
<p>
I cringed as I read the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14953963" title=" Denver Post's interview"> Denver Post&#8217;s interview</a> with Jordan&#8212;the poor man is traumatized and maimed.&nbsp; &#8220;He has been on powerful painkillers since the amputation and is discovering how much he misses his little finger,&#8221; Kirk Mitchell wrote.&nbsp; &#8220;He frequently types for his job and when he reaches for the &#8216;a&#8217; nothing happens.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Have you ever read a sadder sentence?&nbsp; He reaches for the &#8216;a&#8217; and nothing happens!&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
This is an unusual case, something that doesn&#8217;t happen frequently, and yet, it brought to the surface a thought I had about eReaders&#8212;they&#8217;re just too valuable, and if you live a rough-and-tumble life, they are not practical.&nbsp; I&#8217;m willing to bet that nobody ever had a pinky amputated in a book theft incident.&nbsp; I am constantly worrying about my laptop&#8212;how do I keep the kids from covering it with grape jelly and spilling their juice on it?&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I like books.&nbsp; I carry them everywhere, and I never have to worry about them.&nbsp; Even after a good soaking, they&#8217;re still legible, even if they dry out into a lumpy shape.
</p>
<p>
At the park, I can push one kid on the swing and hold a book in the other hand.&nbsp; I take books outside frequently, where often as not, it rains, or my son reaches for the book, his hands covered in grease from the trap in the barbecue that he&#8217;s just explored.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I abuse my books.&nbsp; I dog-ear them, I underline stuff in them (and I like not worrying that Big Brother Bezos knows exactly what I&#8217;ve underlined in them, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2010/0503/Is-it-creepy-that-Amazon-is-tracking-most-highlighted-Kindle-passages" title="as he does for all Kindle books">as he does for all Kindle books</a>).&nbsp; Sometimes if my kids say something funny that I want to remember, I write it down in whatever book I&#8217;m reading.&nbsp; I hope that if the authors of the books in my collection ever get a look at the sorry state of my copies, they know that my books are ugly because they&#8217;ve been loved&#8212;they&#8217;ve been places, they&#8217;ve experienced the elements.
</p>
<p>
I am not saying that I&#8217;ll never buy an eReader.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a Luddite.&nbsp; I like gadgets.&nbsp; Maybe some day when I&#8217;m not broke and the designers have niftied eReaders up as much as they&#8217;re going to and I suddenly have to travel a lot and don&#8217;t want to lug a bag full of books along, then I might get one.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But for now, I don&#8217;t feel deprived.&nbsp; I feel thankful to be hanging out in my backyard with my messy kids in the changeable weather, turning the pages of plain-old books with the help of my trusty, intact pinky finger.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; But enough about amputated fingers.&nbsp; This seems a perfect segue to mention that New West&#8217;s own Community Blogger, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/main/author/BobWire/" title="Bob Wire">Bob Wire</a>, a.k.a. Ednor Therriault, will celebrate the release of his first book, <I>Montana Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff</I> (Globe; $15.95) at <a target="_blank" href="http://shakespeareandco.com/upcoming-events/" title="Shakespeare and Co.">Shakespeare and Co.</a> in Missoula on May 25 at 7 p.m.&nbsp; If there&#8217;s any man who&#8217;s up on his oddities, it&#8217;s Bob Wire.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; The folks at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.highdesertjournal.com/" title="High Desert Journal">High Desert Journal</a> wrote in to say that their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.highdesertjournal.com/high-desert-journal-1/" title="spring issue">spring issue</a> is out now.&nbsp; The Bend, Oreg. and Missoula-based journal says that its mission is to highlight &#8220;the people, places, and issues of the interior West by elevating the voices of artists, authors and cultural organizations in and inspired by the region.&#8221;  Word.&nbsp; The spring issue features work by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/desert_solitude_amy_irvines_trespass/C39/L39/" title="Amy Irvine">Amy Irvine</a>, &#8220;reflections on Don Kerr, founder of High Desert Museum in Bend, Oregon,&#8221; and &#8220;and thoughts on ghost hunting in Baker City, Oregon.&#8221;

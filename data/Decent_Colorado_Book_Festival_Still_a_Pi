							The first and last time I attended the moribund Rocky Mountain Book Festival was in early spring of 2001 at the Denver Merchandise Mart. The Merchandise Mart boasts all the ambiance of an airplane hangar&#8212;located in a blighted warehouse district near I-25, the main facility comprises a cavernous room illuminated by distant fluorescent bulbs. Organizers set the book festival up as if it were no different from the craft fairs, truck exhibitions, and gem and mineral shows that usually fill the venue, and the handful of booths for small presses, authors, and literary organizations looked lost in the space, particularly because attendance was sparse. I listened to a lively discussion about western writing with a panel of genre writers from the region, and saw a good talk by Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City&#8217;s Hayden Planetarium and one of the few authors with sufficient charisma to overcome the dismal setting of his presentation (a dimly lit corner of the main room on a rickety stage).  Still, book lover though I am, I was left feeling as though I had wasted a perfectly good Saturday on a sad little event.<br />
<br />
Due to funding problems and low attendance (go figure!), the Rocky Mountain Book Festival has been cancelled for the past three years, and Rocky Mountain News Books Editor Patti Thorn investigated its status in <a target="_blank" href="http://insidedenver.com/drmn/entertainment_columnists/article/0,1299,DRMN_84_4086401,00.html" title="her column">her column</a> this Saturday. Thorn reports that Maggie Coval, executive director of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ceh.org/" title="Colorado Endowment for the Humanities">Colorado Endowment for the Humanities</a>, is currently heading up a committee that is examining other successful book festivals across the country and is trying to determine whether or not to revive Colorado&#8217;s festival. <br />
<br />
Compared to other states in the region, Colorado does the worst job of funding and encouraging literature. To take two nearby states for comparison: to the north, Montana boasts a lively annual literary festival, is home to one of the finest creative writing programs in the country (at the University of Montana), and supports its writers with state grants. To the east, Nebraska offers numerous prizes to its contemporary writers, encourages the study of its past authors and historical preservation of their artifacts, has a literary magazine powerhouse in the venerable <i>Prairie Schooner</i> (which hosts an annual writing conference), and Nebraska produced the current national poet laureate, Ted Kooser. Meanwhile, in Colorado, the state&#8217;s arts infrastructure that remains after years of funding cuts and upheaval no longer offers grants to individual writers (and hasn&#8217;t for five years) and can&#8217;t seem to stage a halfway decent literary event. The situation is so dire that a few years ago, the NEA threatened to stop funding any Colorado projects, writers, or artists because Colorado lacked the infrastructure to administer the grant money.<br />
<br />
If the beleaguered Colorado Endowment for the Humanities does manage to get its act (and some funding) together some day and stage a book festival, I have three suggestions about how to improve on the old model:<br />
<br />
<b>1. It should emphasize literary fiction, nonfiction, and poetry over genre writing and self-published authors.</b><br />
<br />
Compared to Colorado&#8217;s literary writers, the state&#8217;s genre writers are much more organized and have plenty of gatherings. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rmfw.org/" title="Rocky Mountain Fiction Writers">Rocky Mountain Fiction Writers</a>, a group primarily composed of genre writers, hosts a full schedule of conferences, events, and contests, but there is no comparable organization to emphasize and reward less commercial writing in the state.<br />
<br />
At the Rocky Mountain Book Festival I attended, a greater number of booths seemed to be staffed by self-published authors than those published in the traditional manner. Consequently, there were plenty of kooks; in one booth, I encountered an elderly man who used to be an occasional substitute economics teacher at my high school. When he wasn&#8217;t busy writing me vaguely threatening, multi-page screeds about whatever I&#8217;d written in the school paper that month that he mailed to my home address, this man spent class time enumerating his paranoid theories of American history, theories it seems he&#8217;s since collected in a self-published tract he was hawking at the book festival. Maybe he merited a booth on sheer entertainment value, but shouldn&#8217;t some of Colorado&#8217;s respected poets be graced with a booth as well?<br />
<br />
<b>2. It should be held in an inspiring location.</b><br />
<br />
After several years of Denver Merchandise Mart fiascos, the organizers of the Rocky Mountain Book Festival moved the location to the more inspiring DU campus, but it still didn&#8217;t attract crowds&#8212;a better bet is to follow the example of the wonderful Montana Festival of the Book, which is held in the center of Missoula at various book stores, theaters, art museums, hotels and other venues. This atmosphere of a town taken over by bookishness for a few days a year would be easy to duplicate in Denver by holding events in a concentrated space in LoDo or along Lincoln and Broadway, for example, both places that boast book stores and a share of quirky, fun venues. If attendees need a break from books, they can escape to nearby restaurants and bars and then return refreshed. Boulder&#8217;s Pearl Street Mall area would also be an ideal location, placing the festival in the mix of the town instead of shunting it off to an inaccessible warehouse district.<br />
<br />
<b>3. It should endeavor to involve all of Colorado&#8217;s university writing programs, literary magazines, and book organizations.</b><br />
<br />
The Rocky Mountain Book Festival never seemed to draw on the many literary organizations in Colorado. If people from the CU, CSU, DU, and Naropa writing programs were encouraged to participate, along with representatives from literary magazines such as <i>Many Mountains Moving</i> and <i>Divide</i>, small literary publishing houses such as Ghost Road Press, and the plethora of reading groups that surely exist across the state, the festival could blossom into a community-bolstering event. <br />
<br />
But, I won&#8217;t hold my breath.<br />

		<p>I participated in the 2001 book fair you attended, and having been part of dozens of similar events over the years from the mammoth one on the UCLA campus every April (The LA Times Festival of Books) to the big multi-lingual one in Miami (Miami Book Fair International), I can say without equivocation that the one in Denver was the worst organized, least stimulating and productive, and most inefficient book fair I’ve ever taken part in. I was there to shamelessly flog my new book, "Jack Ruby’s Kitchen Sink: Offbeat Travels Through America’s Southwest," and my publisher, the National Geographic Society, thought a book fair in Denver would be appropriate. I agreed. Boy were we wrong.<br />
<br />
I hope the people considering a new book fair in Denver will take a look at Los Angeles and Miami, as well as Charlottesville, Va., Austin, Tx, and a few others to see what works and what doesn’t. Take your time. Do anything except repeat 2001.</p>

		<p>I agree with much of what Jenny Shank says about support for the literary arts in Colorado; however, I must correct her on one point of fact: "Ploughshares" is not a Nebraska-based publication. That "venerable powerhouse" is published at Emerson College, in Boston. Perhaps she means "Prairie Schooner," which is a very fine publication. I'd commend her to check our website next time, at <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coloradopoets.org">http://www.coloradopoets.org</a>, where we have--so far as we know--the only website online that groups links to literary publications by the states they are published in. We also list the 50 or so publications in Colorado that publish poetry--and all without funding from the Colorado arts bureaucracy or the NEA.</p>

Northwest Bookfest failed too<br />

<br />
I went once and it was impressive but not compelling.<br />
<br />
Going out to a book fest isnt that compelling to even avid readers when you could be reading, or browsing amazon, or blogging,etc. Writers I think would still want to get together and do.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 10-08-05</b>
		<p>Thanks for pointing out my typo, Bryan!  I definitely meant "Prairie Schooner" not "Ploughshares"--I guess that prairie/plough imagery confused me.  I do think that Nebraska's "Prairie Schooner" is a fine magazine that ranks up there in quality with "Ploughshares."<br />
<br />
And thanks for the link to Coloradopoetry.org.  I noticed one publication you listed that I should  point out as another regional lit mag that is becoming more and more respected on a national scale--Colorado Review, published by Colorado State University.  The stories it publishes have increasingly been earning honorable mentions in national anthologies like "Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards" and the Best American Short Stories series.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bryan Roth, 10-09-05</b>
		<p>I'd agree with you, Jenny, about the Colorado Review, although I must point out that it's been respected on a national level for some time now: we'd even heard of it back in Indiana where I went to college--longer ago than I care to admit in print! The Denver Quarterly has also had national stature for some time. A couple of new magazines, "divide" out of CU-Boulder, "Shiny," and "Elixir," both independent journals out of Denver, and "Matter" out of Ft. Collins, are promising up-and-comers. A couple of other interesting independent journals Colorado poetry lovers would be well-served to check out are "Mad Blood" and "Many Mountains Moving," the latter a truly unique, and quite beautifully produced publication that has been around some ten years already and which has published some of the very best poets (and fiction writers) in the country. Also in Ft. Collins (a literary hotbed!) is the "Front Range Review," a modest publication which publishes some very good poetry. And watch out in the future for "Elevation"--I just happen to have some inside information on that one, and I can tell you it will be a force to be reckoned with on a national scale! And as always, I would encourage everyone who loves poetry to support your local (and state) literary publications by buying a copy now and then. If everyone who reads poetry bought one journal a month, it would make a great difference to those publications, most of which are on very tight budgets with over-worked, volunteer staffs.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 10-12-05</b>
		<p>As literature coordinator for the Wyoming Arts Council, I was on the first planning committee for the Rocky Mountain Book Festival in 1992-93. The goal, early on, was to make it a regional event and not just a Denver or Colorado bookfest. I worked with other lit coordinators at state arts agencies in Utah, Idaho, and Colorado, back when it had a great Arts Council organizer in Danny Salazar. We partially succeeded, luring poets and writers from these states, sometimes with Arts Council funding. Later, in '95 or '96, the Western States Arts Federation in Denver helped bring in those writers who were part of an anthology for the Tumblewords Audience Development Project. Those mid-90s bookfests at Currigan were raucous affairs, with tons of local schoolkids, a neat book fair, and poetry readings competing with cappuccino machines. Little-known literary writers hob-nobbed (and argued) with those on best-seller lists. Those bookfests were fun, full of energy, and well-organized by the Colorado Center for the Book's committee. When I attended the 2001 version at the Merchandise Mart, the bridal fair next door drew tons of people while tumbleweeds blew through the cavernous bookfest space. I lost track of the event when it was moved yet again. We've now formed a committee for an October 2006 Wyoming Book Festival in Casper. The RMBF is proving to be a case study in how poor planning, schedule-changing, venue-hopping, and lack of focus can destroy a great event.</p>

		<p>So there <i>were</i> some glory days for Denver's sad book festival after all!  It sounds like I'll have to make a pilgrimage to Casper next fall.</p>

Mike Merschel, the one-time Coloradoan and current editor of the Dallas Morning News&#8217; book blog <a target="_blank" href="http://books.beloblog.com/" title="Texas Pages">Texas Pages</a>, recently <a target="_blank" href="http://books.beloblog.com/archives/2007/10/play_ball_favorite_baseball_bo.html" title="posted about the best in baseball literature">posted about the best in baseball literature</a>, while admitting he&#8217;s not the biggest fan of the sport: &#8220;those of us who spent our childhoods buried in books still tend to cringe when someone comes at us with hard balls and large bats.&#8221;  Still, he puts in a vote for W.P. Kinsella&#8217;s <i>Shoeless Joe</i>.&nbsp;

							<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org/events/past/2008/10-1-08wla/wla.html" title="Western Literature Week">Western Literature Week</a>, a collaboration between the Center of the American West and the Western Literature Association, kicks off today in Boulder.&nbsp; Public readings by Western authors will be held from October 1 through 4, including the October 2 presentations of Aaron Abeyta and Linda Hogan ("Western Poetic Landscapes,&#8221; 4 p.m.) and William Kittredge and Patricia Limerick ("Western Collaborations,&#8221; 7 p.m.).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Other highlights are Teresa Jordan and Laura Pritchett&#8217;s discussion entitled &#8220;Women Write the Range&#8221; (October 3, 12:15 p.m.) and Simon Ortiz and Reg Saner&#8217;s &#8220;Reflecting the Sacred and Sacrificed West&#8221; (October 3, 5 p.m.).&nbsp; All events are at the Millennium Harvest House Motel, except for the October 4 Janet Campbell Hale presentation, which will be held at the Old Main Chapel on CU Campus (7 p.m.).&nbsp; Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usu.edu/westlit/conference2008.htm" title="the complete schedule here">the complete schedule here</a>.

In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/city/article/denver_picks_dead_author/C94/L94/" title="the ongoing saga">the ongoing saga</a> of former Missoulian Sherry Jones&#8217; <I>The Jewel of Medina</I>, a novel written from the perspective of one of the wives of the prophet Muhammad, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/world/europe/29jewel.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" title="New York Times reports">New York Times reports</a> that an arson at U.K. publisher Gibson Square may be linked to the controversial content of the book.&nbsp; The home of Martin Rynja, Gibson Square&#8217;s publisher, was attacked this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Sarah Lyall writes: &#8220;Early Saturday morning, Mr. Rynja&#8217;s house in North London, which doubles as Gibson Square&#8217;s headquarters, was set on fire. Three men were arrested on suspicion &#8220;of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism,&#8221; the police said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Gibson Square picked the novel up after Random House dropped it, citing the potential for just such retaliation from extremists.&nbsp; The book is due to hit bookstores in Britain on October 30, and a small U.S. publisher, Beaufort Books, plans to publish it here.

The writing of Denver novelist Nick Arvin has been featured in several newspapers recently.&nbsp; The New York Times &#8220;asked four writers from swing states to file dispatches about the presidential campaign during its final weeks,&#8221; and Arvin&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/opinion/21arvin.html" title="first op-ed about the political situation in Colorado">first op-ed about the political situation in Colorado</a> ran recently.&nbsp; He wrote about how things look from the cubicle at the engineering firm where he works in downtown Denver.&nbsp; The Rocky Mountain News ran Arvin&#8217;s contribution to its Denver fiction series, &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/sep/23/armistice-day/" title="Armistice Day">Armistice Day</a>,&#8221; last week.

Finally, last week the National Book Foundation announced the recipients of its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalbook.org/5under35.html" title=""5 Under 35"">&#8220;5 Under 35&#8221;</a> award, and Matthew Eck, who earned his M.F.A. in creative writing from the University of Montana, was among the honorees.&nbsp; Five established writers picked five up-and-comers under the age of 35 for the award, and Joshua Ferris selected Eck&#8217;s book, <I>The Farther Shore</I>.&nbsp; Eck and four others will be feted on November 10 in New York.&nbsp; Check out Kisha Lewellyn Schlegel&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/city/article/the_reluctant_witness_in_matthew_ecks_the_farther_shore/C8/L8/" title="interview with Eck for New West here">interview with Eck for New West here</a>.

							The Midwest has James Frey, whose memoir <i>A Million Little Pieces</i> was anointed by Oprah, revealed to be riddled with inaccuracies by TheSmokingGun.com (<a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0104061jamesfrey1.html" title=""The Man Who Conned Oprah"">"The Man Who Conned Oprah"</a>), and then <a href="http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/200601/tows_past_20060126.jhtml" title="denounced by Oprah">denounced by Oprah</a> today.  The South has J.T. Leroy, who claimed to have been an abused, male, gay, teenaged West Virginia prostitute and was a literary celebrity until recent investigations (such as this one by <a href="http://www.nymetro.com/nymetro/news/people/features/14718/" title="New York Magazine">New York Magazine</a>) proved that he was the invention of an older, female writer. The West hasn't enjoyed a memoir scandal of its own until today, with Matthew Fleischer of <i>LA Weekly</i> positing that the much-lauded southwestern memoirist Nasdijj is a fraud ("<a href="http://www.laweekly.com/index.php?option=com_lawcontent&task=view&id=12468&Itemid=47" title="Navahoax">Navahoax</a>").  In his acclaimed 2001 memoir <i>The Blood Runs Like A River Through My Dreams</i> Nasdijj claimed he grew up on a Navajo reservation and suffered all sorts of unspeakable abuses.  When Sherman Alexie was approached to blurb the book, he refused, telling Fleischer that as he read the book, "I was thinking this doesn't just sound like me, this <i>is</i> me.  At first I was flattered but as I kept reading I noticed he was borrowing form other Native writers too.  I thought, this can't be real."<br />
<br />
Fleischer reports that "Nasdijj's stories also bear uncanny resemblance to the works of N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Silko and especially Michael Dorris."  Fleischer's extensive, exhaustively researched article theorizes that Nasdijj is the assumed identity of a "struggling white writer of gay erotica."<br />
<br />
The revelations about Frey, LeRoy, and Nasdijj have all come out in a short span of time, and I have a hunch that there will be more deposed memoirists to come.  The publishing industry gives writers huge incentives to claim that their work is nonfiction, even if it isn't.  Nonfiction sells much better than fiction, and it gets much more attention in the pressâ€”the immensely influential <i>New York Times' Book Review</i> seems to review about three times as many nonfiction books as fiction books.  The message is clear to fiction writers: Call it a memoir if you want your book to be published.<br />

		<p>Hey Jenny,<br />
<br />
I remember a few years ago, when Houghton Mifflin was first publishing this memoir, there were already rumblings that Nasdijj might have fabricated certain elements of his story. If I remember correctly, word around the campfire had it that HM was rejecting his sequel(s) based on the unverifiable nature of the story. The sequels were then published elsewhere. It's a measure of the oddness of our industry that it's taken all this time to become a controversy. <br />
<br />
Anyway, kudos to Houghton for doing the right thing five or six years ago, and a big raspberry to the subsequent publishers who were more concerned with sales than with the integrity of what they were producing.<br />
<br />
The unspoken truth within the biz (hopefully, changed by the Oprah / Frey fiasco), is that once the libel lawyers okay a manuscript, it's often published without further fact checking. <br />
<br />

		<p>"The West hasn't enjoyed a memoir scandal of its own until today. . ."  Only if Montana doesn't count as "the West." Judy Blunt and Breaking Clean?  Larry Colton and Counting Coup?</p>

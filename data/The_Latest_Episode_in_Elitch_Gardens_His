							Almost ever since there has been a city of Denver, there has been Elitch Gardens, drawing the city's citizens for summertime entertainment.  Denver was established in 1858, and in 1890, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/elitchgardens/ParkPress/article012405.html" title="John and Mary Elitch opened Elitch Gardens to the public">John and Mary Elitch opened Elitch Gardens to the public</a>.  Since then, Elitch Gardens has evolved from a botanical garden to the center of the city's theater scene and the location of its most happening dance joint to an amusement park with plenty of rollercoasters.  In 1995, Elitch Gardens moved from its original north Denver location to a prime spot in the heart of a revitalized downtown, and then in 1998 Six Flags purchased it and incorporated it into its country-spanning amusement park empire.  Now, according to a recent article in the Rocky Mountain News, Six Flags is "considering selling Elitch Gardens, which it acquired in 1998, and five other amusement parks in the wake of lackluster revenues from low attendance."<br />
<br />
According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/real_estate/article/0,1299,DRMN_414_4798653,00.html" title="John Rebchook's article">John Rebchook's article</a>, the land will likely be sold to developers who will profit from its Central Platte Valley location.  So Elitch Gardens, after over a hundred years of history intertwined with that of the city of Denver, could be no more.<br />
<br />
Anyone who grew up in Denver has Elitch Gardens memories.  Those who were here during the heyday of the Elitch Theater (which opened in 1892 and thrived for decades) saw actors such as Grace Kelly, Lana Turner, and Mickey Rooney on the stage.  The Trocodero Ballroom opened in Elitch Gardens in 1917, and the country's best bandleaders, such as Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey and Benny Goodman, appeared there throughout the big band era.  When Jack Kerouac, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.litkicks.com/Denver/" title="Neal Cassady">Neal Cassady</a> and their other beat buddies were hanging out in Denver in the 1950's, they started to refer to smoking pot as "Elitching," because they liked to engage in this activity at the Gardens.  <br />
<br />
As a Denver kid in the '80s and '90s, I remember enjoying the tame rides in KiddieLand as a kindergartner, sticking my chewing gum on the gum tree that grew next to the interminable line for the log ride as a ten-year-old, and gradually working my way up to riding the terrifyingly rickety Twister as a teenager.  It wouldn't be summer in Denver without a trip to Elitchs', and luckily this was a treat anyone could afford.  It was still a mom-and-pop park back then, the admission prices were much more reasonable than those of chain theme parks across the country.<br />
<br />
Although I missed the north Denver site when Elitch Gardens moved, I thought the downtown location added a unique element to the city's skyline.  I only went to Elitch Gardens under the auspices of Six Flags once--the price of admission was just too expensive (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sixflags.com/parks/elitchgardens/TicketInfo/index.html" title="currently $45 for a one-day adult pass">currently $45 for a one-day adult pass</a>), and the park seemed to have traded some of its down-home Denver attitude in exchange for a generic Six Flags sheen.<br />
<br />
It would be a shame, though, if Elitch Gardens disappears completely once Six Flags sells it.  One bright note in the future of the Elitch legacy is the planned historic restoration of the original Elitch Theater, which is scheduled to reopen in a couple of years as the Center for American Theatre at Historic Elitch Gardens.  (Historian Tom Noel writes about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/spotlight_columnists/article/0,2777,DRMN_23962_4658225,00.html" title="the history of the Elitch Theater here">the history of the Elitch Theater here</a>.)  But if Elitch Gardens' days as an amusement park are over, Denver will hardly be Denver without it.<br />

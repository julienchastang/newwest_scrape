							Despite sub-zero temperatures Friday night, there was standing room only at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulderbookstore.com" title="Boulder Book Store">Boulder Book Store</a> for a talk and book signing by <a target="_blank" href="http://valentinoachakdeng.com/" title="Valentino Achak Deng">Valentino Achak Deng</a>, a Sudanese refugee.  Deng's life story is the subject of the new novel by Dave Eggers, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/books/whatisthewhat.html" title="<i>What is the What</i>"><i>What is the What</i></a>, which I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/jan/07/no-headline-07xegg/" title="recently reviewed for the Daily Camera">recently reviewed for the Daily Camera</a>.  Many of the Sudanese "Lost Boys" who have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradolostboysofsudan.org/" title="settled in the Denver and Boulder area">settled in the Denver and Boulder area</a> were present, as were many of the local volunteers who work with them.  <br />
<br />
The soft-spoken 25-year-old Deng wore a crisp dark suit and tie, and stood before the crowd, telling his harrowing tale that included his flight from murahaleen raiders when he was five years old,  a walk with hundreds of boys to Ethiopia, a journey that took the lives of many of his friends, and years of languishing in refugee camps where he was thankful to receive one meal a day.  He was eventually admitted to the U.S., and, incredibly, was scheduled to fly in on September 11, 2001. <br />
<br />
Deng explained that Eggers "very much wanted to be here," but that his wife, Vendela Vida, had just published a novel, so "Dave has to babysit.  He's an American man.  Sudanese men usually escape that."  Despite this joke, Deng made it clear that his views have changed on the role of women in society from what he was taught in Sudan, and that he now wants to help educate Sudanese women through his foundation.  When he described the family that he left behind in Sudan, he explained, smiling, "My father is a polygamist.  And I'm not going to be like him."<br />
<br />
Deng gave a brief history of Sudan, a country he says "has been at war for over 40 years," beginning with a war from 1956 to 1972, pausing for nine or ten years, and then reviving again in 1983.  "The war ran through the course of my life."  He described his mother's desperation when she learned that the war would be coming to their village: "She regretted that she gave birth to us.  She said if she had the ability to swallow all of us she would so we would not be taken."<br />
<br />
In the refugee camps, the boys were encouraged to go to school, despite the lack of textbooks or supplies.  "If you didn't go to school, you would hear from a friend that there were cookies that were distributed."  Because they had no paper, Deng learned to write by drawing letters in the dirt.  "Writing letter B was my number one problem," he said.<br />
<br />
Once Deng was resettled in the U.S., his life was far from easy.  The Eggers book describes how he was mugged in his Atlanta apartment.  "They put a pistol on my head and kicked me and beat me until I was unconscious," Deng explained.  But despite his innumerable sufferings, Deng smiled through his presentation and seemed to radiate a deep joy that his sorrows haven't been able to eliminate.  He's now a student at Allegany College in Pennsylvania, where he is designing his own major in diplomacy and world affairs.  <br />
<br />
One audience member asked if he wanted to stay in the U.S. or if he felt it was his duty to return to Sudan.  Deng replied that he was torn between the two countries.  "I would like to have a family in the U.S. and have my children go to school here.  The best thing I can do is grow here and then bring back resources and knowledge to Sudan."  He plans to return this summer to his home village of Marial Bai in Southern Sudan and build a community resource center.  Sales of "What is the What" benefit <a target="_blank" href="http://valentinoachakdeng.com/foundation.html" title="Deng's foundation">Deng's foundation</a>, which will fund such projects.  Many in the audience asked questions about the current situation in Sudan and what they could do to help.  Deng directed them towards his website, where he lists <a target="_blank" href="http://valentinoachakdeng.com/history.html" title="ten ways for people to get involved">ten ways for people to get involved</a>.<br />

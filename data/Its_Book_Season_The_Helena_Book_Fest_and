							<p>I&#8217;ve got a lot of odds and ends to mention today, many good excuses to get out of the house and enjoy some bookish activities across the region this week:
</p>
<p>
<b>Montana</b>
</p>
<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helenabookfest.com/index.html" title="Helena Festival of the Book">Helena Festival of the Book</a> kicks off tomorrow and runs through the weekend, September 24-26 at the Holter Museum of Art and the Montana Historical Society. Participants include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_steven_rinella/C39/L39/" title="Steven Rinella">Steven Rinella</a>, Wendy Parciak, Samuel Ligon and Laurie Lamon.
</p>
<p>
A few weeks ago I shared my enthusiasm for Thomas Savage&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/nature_wins_in_thomas_savages_the_pass/C39/L39/" title="The Pass">The Pass</a></I>.&nbsp; O. Alan Weltzien, who teaches at Western Montana College of The University of Montana, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drumlummon.org/html/The%20Pass.htm" title="wrote the forward for the new edition of the novel">wrote the forward for the new edition of the novel</a>, and he&#8217;s going to be discussing Savage as part of the Helena Book Festival. His lecture, entitled, &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.helenabookfest.com/html/Schedule08.html" title="Not Always Happy Endings: Thomas and Elisabeth Savage">Not Always Happy Endings: Thomas and Elisabeth Savage</a>,&#8221; will be held at the Montana Historical Society (Sept. 24, 6:30 p.m.).&nbsp; On September 25, Weltzien will participate in a Thomas Savage panel along with Sue Hart and Karl Olson (Montana Historical Society, 12 p.m.).&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t make it out to Helena, the three Savage buffs will reprise their panel at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitiesmontana.org/BookFestival/bookfest.php" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a> in Missoula in October.
</p>
<p>
Weltzien wrote in to mention that this summer he participated in the &#8220;Lemhi County Historical Society annual road trip, devoted to Thomas Savage country and <I>The Pass</I> in particular.&nbsp; I contend <i>The Pass</i> forms Savage&#8217;s most Idahoan novel, in terms of setting.&#8221;  Weltzien sent some photos of the tour, which you can see above. Weltzien wrote, &#8220;the three primary players in these photos are Fred Snook, retired judge, fourth-generation Lemhi Co. citizen, raconteur, and tour leader; Ralph Nichol, of Belgrade MT, who is Savage&#8217;s first cousin and told many stories about the Yearians; and Yours truly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Phil Condon, who teaches in the Environmental Studies Program at the University of Montana, will read from his new short story collection, <I>Nine Ten Again</I>, at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.factandfictionbooks.com/event/phil-condon-reading-and-signing" title="Fact and Fiction">Fact and Fiction</a> in Missoula on Friday, September 25 (7 p.m.).&nbsp; Look for my review of it tomorrow.

</p>
<p>

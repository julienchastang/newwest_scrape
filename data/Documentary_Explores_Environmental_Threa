							<a target="_blank" href="http://www.katahdin.org/homelandabout.htm" title="Homeland: Four Portraits of Native Action">Homeland: Four Portraits of Native Action</a>, which will screen at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverfilm.org/" title="Denver International Film Festival">Denver International Film Festival</a> on November 15 and 16 and on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.katahdin.org/homelandscreenings.htm" title="Montana Public Television">Montana Public Television</a> on November 8, offers a compelling, in-depth look at the environmental pressures that Native American reservations across the country are currently facing. In four segments filmed in Montana, Alaska, New Mexico, and Maine, director Roberta Grossman illustrates how Native Americans are fighting incursions on their land.  The Bush administrationâ€™s policy of exploiting all possible sources of energy in the United States has pitted many tribes against the federal government and energy companies in the most intense legal battles theyâ€™ve faced since the last U.S. energy crisis of the 1970â€™s. Although each of the segments offers a David-versus-Goliath-like tale of an impoverished Indian reservation struggling against some of the wealthiest corporations in the country, <i>Homeland</i> is a hopeful film, in large part because of the charismatic, indefatigable tribal leaders who are heading up the fight.<br />
<br />
<b>Lame Deer, Montana, Northern Cheyenne Reservation</b><br />
Gail Small is an indomitable Cheyenne lawyer who is leading the southeastern Montana reservationâ€™s battle against energy companies. â€œAll my life weâ€™ve been fighting to keep strip mining off our land,â€? she explained.  â€œWeâ€™re surrounded by Montanaâ€™s largest power plant, five strip mines, and the largest coal fire generating complex in the country.â€? Even when the tribe has succeeded in keeping power companiesâ€™ operations off the reservation, these companies frequently set up operations right on the perimeter of the land, dumping coal bed methane water into streams that the Cheyenne once used.  <br />
<br />
Although the government is now interested in natural gas instead of coal, to Small it seems that they are reprising the â€œcoal warsâ€? of thirty years ago, when tribal leaders who could not speak English signed a contract allowing coal companies to explore their lands. When the leaders realized that â€œexplorationâ€? meant the destruction of their reservation, they sued to break the contract.  At the time, there was no high school on the reservation and Cheyenne children were bused 25 miles away to school in Colstrip, Montana.  In Colstrip, many of the white childrenâ€™s parents worked for coal companies, and the tension of the times took its toll: The Cheyenne were taunted and called â€œprairie niggers,â€? and many of them dropped out of school.<br />
<br />
In the 1980â€™s, the Cheyenne won their court case and all the leases were cancelled.  This was when Small started a non-profit organization called Native Action, whose goal is to provide information to tribe members about the economic and environmental choices they face.  Although per capita income is less than $10,000 a year in the reservation, and as Small says, â€œwe could all be millionaires if we signedâ€? a contract with a natural gas company, for thirty years tribe members have voted this option down.  But the Northern Cheyenne face a new legal struggleâ€”recently the Bureau of Land Management approved methane exploration on the boarders of the reservation without consulting with tribe members, and so once again Small has filed a lawsuit.<br />
<br />
<b>Arctic Village, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska</b><br />
Evon Peter, the young chief of the Gwichâ€™in people in Arctic Village, has lead the fight to keep oil exploration out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  The governmentâ€™s planned drilling areas include a swath of land in the migratory path of the Porcupine caribou herd, the animals that the tribe depends upon for food and clothing.  <br />
<br />
The Gwichâ€™in live in the far northeastern corner of Alaska, and they would have continued to lead lives isolated from most of America had not oil been discovered near their town.  In 1960, President Eisenhower set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a protected area, but eight years later a major oil site was discovered west of the refuge.  Since then, oil companies have fought to open up more of the land for exploitation, with only a brief pause after a wave of bad publicity from the Exxon Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska on March 23, 1989.<br />
<br />
Peter continues his legal battles with the powerful forces who support drilling in ANWR, and as he explained, he has to work at the same speed as those who are working toward the opposite goal, a pace that disrupts the traditional patterns of tribal life.<br />
<br />
<b>Navajo Reservation, New Mexico</b><br />
In the 1950â€™s, Navajos worked in uranium mines with no protection from radiation, which led to a hundred percent increase in infant deaths, a lung cancer rate in miners that was 28 times higher the rate in other Navajos, and a quintupling of the bone cancer rate.  The mines were eventually shut down after the Three Mile Island scare led to the downfall of the uranium industry.<br />
<br />
In 1994, a uranium company initiated plans to resume mining in the Navajo Nation.  They promised Navajo landowners thousands of dollars, and the landowners agreed to sell the mineral rights to their land.  Mitchell and Rita Capitan, a middle-aged couple with four children, decided to organize a community meeting with the goal of blocking the uranium mining.  Although as Rita said, â€œWe lost some friends,â€? eventually they won over a large number of Navajos who signed a petition against the uranium mining. But their fight has been renewed, as the energy bills of 2001 and 2003 emphasize uranium exploration in the U.S.<br />
<br />
<b>Penobscot, Maine</b><br />
The Penobscot tribe used to live throughout the state of Maine, but their reservation is now confined to a series of islands that are downstream from pulp and paper factories which pump pollutants, including dioxin, into the water.  The cancer rate among the Penobscot is double that among the rest of Maineâ€™s population, and tribe members suffer skin rashes, headaches, and lesions from the polluted water.  The fish in the Penobscot River are so full of toxins that the state of Maine issued a health advisory stipulating that no should one eat more than one 8-ounce serving of this fish per month. This has posed a problem for the Penobscot, for whom fish is a traditional food and an important staple of their diet.<br />
<br />
As the paper industry is a major force in Maineâ€™s economy, it has lobbied the state legislature effectively to keep environmental regulations lax. In recent years, the state petitioned the EPA to take control of the permits for the paper mills, and Penobscot Chief Barry Dana led the legal battle against this action, which would allow for even looser environmental controls. The tribe ultimately lost their court case, but as is typical of the Native American leaders featured in <i>Homeland</i>, Dana remains optimistic: â€œThirty years of environmental protections are quietly being dismantled.  People are destroying the country, but itâ€™s going to be people to bring it back.  The wisdom thatâ€™s going to be the driving force behind this is held in this landâ€™s first people.  Itâ€™s our culture, itâ€™s our traditions and our values that are going to save the planet.â€?<br />
<br />
<i>Homeland</i> offers a cogent account of the legal battles that Native Americans have been fighting to avoid the environmental degradation of their lands, and it has won several awards, including the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival and the Social Justice Award at the same event. <i>Homeland</i> is a finalist for the Best Documentary Award at the Denver International Film Festival, where it will screen on November 15 at 9 p.m. and November 16 at 6:15 p.m.

		<b>Comment By Bill, 11-08-05</b>
		<p>Maybe it's a typo ... or maybe it's for real: I know the world is desperate for energy wherever it can be found, but in your piece on "Lame Deer, Montana, Northern Cheyenne Reservation," you say the Bureau of Land Management"approved methane exploration on the boarders of the reservation..." How desperate is that?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-08-05</b>
		<p>That quote repeats what Gail Small reported in the movie, and I think it's accurate.  There's an update on Montana situation on the website of the organization that produced the documentary, <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.katahdin.org%3A">http://www.katahdin.org:</a><br />
<br />
"Since the filming of Homeland ended, the Northern Cheyenne and their allies lost a battle to stop 500 wells per year from being opened up in southeastern Montana. If the mining companiesâ€™ current plans continue, these wells will reach the Cheyenneâ€™s borders within two years."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bill, 11-09-05</b>
		<p>I guess I made my point a little too subtly. The sentence in question creates the picture of people -- "boarders" -- on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation who can be explored for methane.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-09-05</b>
		<p>Whoops!  Thanks for pointing out the typo.  I'm always happy to supply a mistake that suggests...flatulence as a source of energy resources.  (Has Cheney considered this yet?)  Guess I have to leave it in there now for posterity, though, as these comments won't make sense without it...</p>

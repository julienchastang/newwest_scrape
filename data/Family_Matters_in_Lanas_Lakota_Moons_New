&#8220;Lana&#8217;s Lakota Moons,&#8221; the new novel for young readers by Virginia Driving Hawk Sneve, is the affecting tale of two cousins ("sisters in the Lakota way") with clashing personalities, growing up amid a close family and the larger South Dakota American Indian community.&nbsp; Lori, the narrator, is calm and bookish, while her cousin, Lana, is a high-spirited showoff who is &#8220;quick to do something that got her in trouble, then quick to be sorry in order to get out of trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  I can&#8217;t imagine a young reader of this book who won&#8217;t be drawn to the portrait of the strong community around these girls that Driving Hawk Sneve creates; these are two girls who squabble with each other yet know where they belong in their family, their tribe, and among their ancestors, who are kept vivid to them through the tales their grandparents tell.&nbsp; How thrilling it must feel for a child to have Grandpa tell you that only a few generations back your family was hunting buffalo on horseback over the open prairie.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Driving Hawk Sneve focuses on the positive aspects of Lakota life--Lana and Lori are part of a functional, intact, employed family without alcoholic or poverty-stricken members--and yet she maintains an honest realism about American Indian history that never shades into bitterness.&nbsp; Because of this, readers of any ethnicity will feel welcomed to the tale, just like Shoua, the Hmong immigrant friend that Lana and Lori make at school. 
</p>
<p>
The book opens on a snowy November day with Lana and Lori bored indoors at the house of their grandparents, who look after them when their parents are at work.&nbsp; Grandma is skillful at disarming the girls when they conflict with each other, and she suggests a project: creating a calendar using the Lakota names for the months.&nbsp; The names are evocative, such as that for January, called &#8220;Moon of the Terrible&#8221; because of the bitter cold and harsh conditions, and February, called &#8220;Moon When There is Frost inside the Lodge,&#8221; because as Grandma explains, &#8220;the people had to spend most of the time in their tipis.&nbsp; Their breathing made the walls frosty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This book will be of interest to adults as well as children in part because of the wisdom that the grandparents share.&nbsp; Their lessons are woven into the story, arising when the girls do something to prompt the tales, and frequently offer fascinating tidbits about Lakota life and history.&nbsp; My favorite explained something that I&#8217;d wondered about when I became the mother of a very noisy newborn--how did mothers throughout history keep infants quiet when their lives depended on it?&nbsp; Grandma explains that babies had to be kept quiet when the tribe was in enemy territory or when &#8220;the army was chasing them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Soon after a baby was born, the mother began training the child to be quiet.&nbsp; When the baby cried, she put her hand over its nose and mouth and whispered <I>chichi</I>.&nbsp; It stopped, because it couldn&#8217;t catch its breath.&nbsp; After doing this many, many times, all the mother had to do was touch the baby&#8217;s face and it would stop.&nbsp; Then when the child was walking and the mother couldn&#8217;t touch its face to make it be still, all she had to say was <I>chichi</I>, and the child knew there was danger near and that he or she must not make any noise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Driving Hawk Sneeve sets each of her twelve chapters in a different month that occur over the course of several years.&nbsp; She captures the excitement that children feel during special events, such as a Christmas pageant, a powwow filled with dancers of many tribes, and a buffalo roundup at which the girls are &#8220;thrilled and excited at the amazing sight of this living, fluid mass flowing down one hill and up another.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At one point, Grandma announces that she will be giving the girls each a Lakota name at an official naming ceremony.&nbsp; The family spends several months in preparation, and I was reminded of Julia Alvarez&#8217;s recent book,<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/quince_nation_julia_alvarezs_once_upon_a_quinceanera/C132/L39/" title=" Once Upon A Quincea&#241;era,"> Once Upon A Quincea&#241;era,</a> in which she posits that the 15th-birthday party celebrations have become such a phenomenon because adolescents yearn for some kind of community ritual to help them make the transition into adulthood and give them a sense of belonging.&nbsp; Lana and Lori have the benefit of their own Lakota tradition, which they end up sharing with their Hmong friend.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s my job as a book reviewer not to give away the ending, and I won&#8217;t, but I have to mention its affect, because the ending of <I>Lana&#8217;s Lakota Moons</I> came as such a shock that it made me reevaluate the entire book.&nbsp; Driving Hawk Sneve laid the ground for the conclusion, but in such a short book, it&#8217;s difficult for the reader to prepare for such an abrupt change in tone.&nbsp; I suppose the gentleness of Driving Hawk Sneve&#8217;s voice, as well as her resolute focus on the positive aspects of life in the Lakota community, lulled me into thinking that she could not possibly write such an ending, which cast a pall over the girls&#8217; natural and innocent bickering.&nbsp; In the ending, the darker elements that are subtly mentioned throughout the book take precedence, and serve to remind the characters why they need such a tightly-knit community: to support them through times of trial, and to remember them when they are gone.

							Mid- to late October is the most glorious time of year for the sports fan, the season when it is possible to gorge on a smorgasbord of athletic events: There’s the World Series, college and NFL football seasons are in full swing, hockey has begun, and basketball season isn’t far off.  But for the Rocky Mountain sports fan at this time of year, things aren’t so rosy.  We don't have that many pro and NCAA Division I teams in this region, and the ones we do have are faltering: by the end of this October, the Rockies, as usual, are deep into their off-season, both CU and the Broncos have posted decent records but have revealed that they probably won’t be vying for championships this year, and the Avs stand at 4 and 4, which will interest only the hockey fans that remain loyal after the NHL’s year-long sulk.  At this time of year, there’s only one hope for the Rocky Mountain sports fan seeking a championship: There’s always the Nuggets.  Admittedly, this hope has become less of a farce in recent years as the team has prospered under George Karl’s leadership, but it still might arouse a giggle from fans of the NBA’s more traditional powerhouses.<br />
<br />
There were a few occasions during this century when things worked out well for Rocky Mountain teams.  For example, in 1943, mighty Wyoming brought home the NCAA Division I basketball championship by trouncing Georgetown, 46-34.  CU’s basketball team made it into the Final Four during the illustrious, oft-remembered 1942 season. (Was the team composed of young men medically disqualified from fighting in World War II?)  Decades passed.  Finally, in 1990, CU’s football team won the NCAA Division I football championship, ushering in the headiest era of Rocky Mountain sports success: The ‘90s were our time.  The usually hapless Rockies won the wild card slot into the MLB playoffs in 1995.  The Avs won the Stanley Cup in 1996 their very first season in Colorado, startling fans that were used to grimly enduring decades of humiliating loss without expecting a glimmer of success.  The Broncos finally won the Super Bowl in 1998 and 1999, before sending John Elway on to his retirement and second career as Colorado’s Most—And Really Only—Notable Celebrity. The Avs closed out this era of Rocky Mountain sports success with a second championship in the 2000-2001 season.<br />
<br />
Rocky Mountain team sports flourished during the height of the dot-com era, allowing the construction of LoDo and lots of overly-optimistic feelings to burble up about our regional supremacy, but just as the economy faded, so did our athletic fortunes, which now are reflected by the Rockies’ .414 winning percentage this season, putting them in a three-way tie for second-to-worst team in baseball. (One more crackpot theory that I can’t resist throwing out: the White Sox’s last World Series victory in 1917 presaged the deadly flu epidemic of 1918.  So get your shots, folks, and don’t be kissing any chickens!)<br />
<br />
How will we cope with what could be another century of ignominy for the sports teams of the Rocky Mountain region?  By doing what we’ve always done: Each of us will adopt teams from other regions to root for during post-season play.  If you have no built-in affiliations or wagers riding on the outcome, here’s a good formula that will allow the selection of which team to root for in any competition: First, always root <i>against</i> the Yankees.  Do not root for any teams from New York, Texas, or Florida.  When teams from these states play each other, choose the team from the city that is least odious to you.  (For example, I find San Antonio less repellant than Houston, so if the Spurs were to play the Rockets, I’d pull for the Spurs.)  Next, choose the team that that is geographically the closest to your hometown—in some cases, this will result in rooting for a team from as far away as Chicago or Seattle.  If none of these methods have allowed you to select a team, always root for the underdog.  <br />
<br />
This should tide us over for the next six decades or so, when one of our Rocky Mountain teams may again emerge triumphant on the national stage.

		<p>Jenny - I certainly agree with you about the plight of the Rocky Mountain area sports fans. Often there is not much to root for in the way of teams. However, I believe you have not yet considered the University of Montana Grizzlies football team. They have been a consistently high ranking team and been to the national playoffs for a number of years now. Plus the team has won 2 national championhips and placed second twice. So there you have it. Root for the University of Montana football team! Oh - we also have a mascot that has been national mascot of the year two years running now! Monte is his name.</p>

		<p>I know that the festival is a money maker but how much good does it do for the home town people.  If possible most people leave town...</p>

							It's a sweltering 82 degree April day in Boulder this afternoon, but the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/" title="Conference on World Affairs">Conference on World Affairs</a> continues to draw sizeable crowds, even to air-conditioner-free venues like Old Main, where four writers took the stage to discuss "Character, Action, Conspiracy and Conflict: What Makes A Good Story."  The panel comprised Texas historical novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=660&year=2006" title="Cindy Bonner">Cindy Bonner</a>, South African storyteller, poet, and writing teacher <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=696&year=2006" title="Dorian Haarhoff">Dorian Haarhoff</a>, television producer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=689&year=2006" title="David Jacobs">David Jacobs</a> (who gave the world <i>Dallas</i> and <i>Knot's Landing</i>) and novelist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/bios.html?id=523&year=2006" title="Kate Lehrer">Kate Lehrer</a>.<br />
<br />
Haarhoff began with an engaging, story-laced ten-minute talk about the nature of fairytales, which begin in a state of stasis, "the sense of perfection with which stories open," then comes the "wound," where "the paradise is disrupted."  The wound prompts the journey, "the work that needs to be done," and as the character encounters forces and reacts to them, he's given something to take with him.  He emphasized the importance of dramatic triangles in stories, saying, "If you have two characters, you have a dialogue, if you have three, you have a drama." <br />
<br />
Cindy Bonner said that she believed the most important element of the panel's title is character, and she gave the example of the recent film <i>Syriana</i> as a work that she believed failed in its characterization.  "<i>Syriana</i> had action, conspiracy, and conflict, but its characterization was lacking, and I left it feeling that I just didn't care about any of the people in it."<br />
<br />
David Jacobs illustrated what he believed to be the most important elements of story by describing a conversation he'd witnessed during the hot summer of 2004 in Provence, France.  He was eating at a restaurant in a small village, and noticed a stylish couple that drove up in a huge Mercedes SUV, a vehicle that was totally inappropriate for the tiny, winding roads of the small towns in the area.  Jacobs began to eavesdrop on the conversation of the couple, and he deduced several things: 1) "They agreed that the car was an absurd thing to have." 2) "They weren't married; they were new." 3) "This was their first big trip together, and they lived in Connecticut."  The man began to make phone calls on his cell phone to see if he could exchange the Mercedes for a more appropriate vehicle.  Meanwhile, he struggled over what to order for lunch, and finally ordered an omelet, though he continued to dither about his choice, to the woman's annoyance.  He asked the woman what car they should get, and she insisted, "Just get anything," gesturing at the small European cars parked outside.  He insisted that he couldn't drive just anything, and continued to make cell phone calls until a new car was arranged for them.  '"What did you get?" she asked.  "A Ferrari," he said.' And Jacobs said that he knew at that point, the relationship was over.  He thought the scene would make a perfect one-act play, and that it had all the important elements of story because it was a high stakes situation with "two interesting characters who felt strongly enough about each other to take a trip together."<br />
<br />
Kate Lehrer said that the best description she's heard of how a story works is that you "get the monkey up the tree, throw rocks at him, and get him down."  She begins her novels with a character in mind, and asks herself the questions, "Where did she come from?  What does she want?  Where is she going?"<br />
<br />
Lehrer and Bonner agreed that they write character-driven stories, and that coming up with plots is a real struggle for them.  Haarhoff was less intimidated by plots, and explained that "the plot in a book is an internal causation, in which what is happening in our lives is made more evident.  There are always connections in life, but the plot in a book enables you to see them."  Haarhoff believed that plots come about by examining all the connections between the characters, and Jacobs agreed, saying that at the beginning of a season of writing for a TV show, he'd sit down and list all the characters, asking what they wanted and believed, and drawing lines and circles to indicate the connections between them, and in that way he could "come up with 22 hours of television a year."<br />
<br />
Haarhoff said that his students often ask him, "How do you write about feelings?"  The answer is "you don't," he said.  "You describe what led to the feelings and you tune up the description around it."  He emphasized the importance of writing "in a way where your reader becomes a creative partner, by leaving silences for them to enter."  He also believes that a specific setting is crucial to a story; that "stories must smell of place.  When you are specific in your place, you're generous to your reader, you give them a place to stand."<br />

What a cool thing to find on this site. I was fascinated by the nuts and bolts of storytelling outlined in this piece. I'd like to take a class taught by David Jacobs or Haarhoff, or any of these folks. Cindy Bonner nailed why I, too, left Syriana feeling like the movie had made a fantastic shot at something, had everything, was important, but still just did not work. <br />
I really like what you've done here.<br />

							<p>Gregory Hill, who works as a book buyer at the University of Denver&#8217;s Penrose Library, is one of three finalists in the general fiction category for this year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/b?node=332264011" title="Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award">Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award</a>. According to the contest website, Hill&#8217;s novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/East-Denver-excerpt-Breakthrough-ebook/dp/B004TEYTGO/ref=amb_link_356373602_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-4&amp;pf_rd_r=0Y68CMF6YA4D18B3YBM3&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1298825582&amp;pf_rd_i=332264011" title="East of Denver">East of Denver</a></I>, &#8220;tells the story of Shakespeare Williams, who returns to his family&#8217;s farm in eastern Colorado to find his widowed, senile father living in squalor. Facing the loss of the farm, Shakespeare hatches a plot with his father and a motley crew of his former high school classmates to rob the local bank.&#8221;

Greg Glasgow recently interviewed Hill for the <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.du.edu/today/news/penrose-staffer-one-of-three-finalists-in-amazon-novel-contest" title="University of Denver blog">University of Denver blog</a>. Glasgow writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The story is based on Hill&#8217;s own past growing up in Joes, Colo. (called Dorsey, Colo., in the book), and his more recent experiences watching his father&#8217;s battle against Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.
</p>
<p>
&#8216;It was supposed to be a book about zombies, but then my dad got Alzheimer&#8217;s, so I wanted to write something about that,&#8217; says Hill, who has a degree in English literature from the University of Colorado. &#8216;There&#8217;s all these Alzheimer&#8217;s memoirs that are really sensitive and thoughtful, and I wanted to write something that wasn&#8217;t as sensitive or thoughtful about that disease. So I said &#8216;what can you do to make Alzheimer&#8217;s fun?&#8217; I was like well, I&#8217;ll have the kid try to rob a bank with the old man.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

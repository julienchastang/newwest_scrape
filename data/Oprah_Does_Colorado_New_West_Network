Oprah is airing footage of the road trip across the country she took this summer and yesterday featured her jaunt across southern Colorado.  A lot of the footage focuses on her bickering with friend Gail King over control of the radio, but everyone was happy during the Colorado segment.  As Oprah crossed over the New Mexico/Colorado border, her film crew focused on the old-school "Welcome to Colorful Colorado" sign (whose endangerment had been the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/5303/" title="subject of much controversy this year">subject of much controversy this year</a>) as she read it aloud.  As she and pal Gail drove through the Rockies, depicted with panoramic glamour shots, Oprah announced, "If you haven't seen Colorado, you haven't seen America."<br />
<br />
The duo stopped in Durango, where she declared, "Nobody is fat here."  They talked to a slim woman in cycling gear about why everyone was so fit.  The cyclist explained that everyone hikes, bikes, and recreates the flab away in Durango.  The only pudgy person Oprah came across was a woman from Texas.  Oprah declared "I love this town," at least four times during the segment.  Against Oprah's wishes, Gail convinced her to dress up and pose for Old West photos there.<br />
<br />
Then they headed to Pagosa Springs to visit a viewer who'd written in about the healing property of the springs she works at.  The beautiful view in South Fork, Colorado, sent Oprah into ecstasies.  And they stopped in Trinidad to meet with a family who'd relocated there since losing their home to hurricane Katrina.  The father said that he worried they wouldn't fit in (as they are apparently the only black family in Trinidad), but that the community had made them feel completely welcome and that he was happy about his life again.  Somewhere in Colorado, Oprah stopped at a Dairy Queen, and her trainer gave her hell for indulging in a small vanilla cone.<br />
<br />
If your only impression of Colorado was derived from watching Tuesday's Oprah show, you'd think the state was heaven: A blue-skied haven of fit, fat-free, racially-tolerant mountain folk who like to recreate in mountain springs, trails, and rivers.  Surely there are some dark, fat, seedy elements of our state she must have missed?  In any case, the Colorado tourism board's work is done for the year.<br />

		<p>While this may be great for the tourism bureau, many of the citizens of the Western Slope would be better off if Oprah had toured the Piceance Basin and spoken to property owners that have had to endure the hardships of the boom.  Oprah may have enjoyed the stunning vistas that we currently have, but I would have preferred if she spoke on the ones that we are currently losing.</p>

		<p>Instead of either/or, wouldn't be nice if her road trip had taken her to both? Viewers could have seen the contrast relatively pristine landscapes and defiled ones. I don't usually watch Oprah, but tuned in while I was folding laundry. Before crossing the border to Colorado, she was on the Navajo Reservation and visited a young woman who lived in an appalling shack ("cabin" would be flattery) and was struggling to feed herself and provide for her 6-week-old baby and an older woman who lived without  indoor plumbing and was struggling to care for an ailing husband. The contrast between their lives and the Lycra-clad cyclist and the overweight, vacationing Texan was more dramatic than if Oprah had only been on the rez.</p>

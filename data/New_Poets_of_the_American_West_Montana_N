The Crow call this time of year the Black Cherry Moon
<br />
when the rose hips are blood-bright, 
<br />
spattered on their overwrought stems, and the creek 
<br />
calls so clearly in words almost our own 
<br />
as we come sliding down the bank.&nbsp; 
<br />
Last night, we covered the gardens in plastic.&nbsp; 
<br />
The chickadees were back after their wide diet of summer.
<br />
We ate the last trout, its spine curved from disease.
<br />
So much can go wrong, I want to know 
<br />
what you will promise me as our hands reach in and in 
<br />
through the copper, the carmine leaves.&nbsp; 
<br />
I know you are lonely, alone with your grief 
<br />
for your parents who are not my parents, for your life, 
<br />
which, despite all, is not my life. The cherries 
<br />
are thick here, hanging in clusters, purple-black from frost.&nbsp; 
<br />
It has started to rain and I am chilled by it.&nbsp; 
<br />
Each day, we promise, we will talk of our fears 
<br />
of intimacy, how we still expect to be hurt when we love.&nbsp;  
<br />
You bring me a coat from the back of the truck,
<br />
but I want to stop our task now, to sit in the cab 
<br />
of the truck while the gray spills, slick with thunder.&nbsp; 
<br />
What if I kissed you there in depth.
<br />
After so many years, I can misunderstand the difference
<br />
between instinct and obligation, how my hand 
<br />
continues to grasp the stems. Keats said 
<br />
poems should come easy as leaves off the trees,
<br />
but see how they cling and wrestle with their ties.
<br />
And now, the sun shines. It is not this grace 
<br />
I had imagined. When Keats said poems, I meant
<br />
love. The chokecherries roll easily 
<br />
into my palm, then fall into the plastic bag that binds 
<br />
my wrist. Over and over, until we have enough,
<br />
until our fingers are bruised with their dark juices.

		<i>(Under the Orange Street Bridge,
<br />
		             	Missoula, Montana)</i>
</p>
<p>
On the under-bridge shelf, cocooned
<br />
in sleeping bags, overcoats, Salvation Army-
<br />
issue blankets: Willie &#8220;Railman,&#8221; Injun
<br />
Tom, Anthony. Willie&#8217;s first
</p>
<p>
to rise&#8212;he drank the least
<br />
of the day&#8217;s proceeds from
<br />
grocery sales. Bought a 30-
<br />
pack&#8212;Anthony had most. Willie
</p>
<p>
troubles at the wide-mouthed
<br />
gasps, pulls a cover up to
<br />
shield Anthony&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Okay?&#8221;
<br />
Tom wakes, &#8220;He okay?&#8221; Willie
</p>
<p>
shrugs, &#8220;No man drinks like that
<br />
and be okay.&#8221; Tom shakes out
<br />
of his huge overcoat, huge man, moves 
<br />
down bank to the Clark Fork
</p>
<p>
River, removes a yellow stone, white
<br />
stone, black stone, red stone from
<br />
his jeans&#8217; pocket, lifts each, bows
<br />
East&#8212;South&#8212;West&#8212;North, raises
</p>
<p>
open palms to the blue sky, lowers to
<br />
the green earth, rejoins Willie: &#8220;Prayed
<br />
the directions for him&#8212;Indian-style&#8212;
<br />
Lord&#8217;s Prayer too. Every bit helps.&#8221;

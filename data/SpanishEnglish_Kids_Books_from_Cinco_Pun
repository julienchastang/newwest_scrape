							<p>Thanks to television shows such as <I>Dora the Explorer</I>, <I>Maya and Miguel</I>, and the trusty <I>Sesame Street</I>, many kids growing up in English-speaking homes can count to ten and say hello in Spanish. Cinco Puntos Press, based in El Paso, specializes in literature that straddles the U.S./Mexico border, and publishes a number of bilingual books for children that will help kids who are interested in Spanish take their language study further.
</p>
<p>
El Paso-based writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.benjaminaliresaenz.com/" title="Benjamin Alire S&#225;enz">Benjamin Alire S&#225;enz</a>&#8216;s <I><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cincopuntos.com/products_detail.sstg?id=146" title="The Dog Who Loved Tortillas">The Dog Who Loved Tortillas</a></b></I> (36 pages, $17.95), with vibrant clay illustrations by Geronimo Garcia, will be a hit with any kid who has ever begged his parents for a dog.&nbsp; In this story, told in Spanish and English with a clay squiggle dividing the two texts on the same page, Little Diego Dom&#237;nguez (who previously appeared in <I>A Gift from Pap&#225; Diego</I>) and his big sister Gabriela simultaneously hit upon the idea that they should get a dog.&nbsp; When they ask their parents for a dog a piece, the parents say they can have a dog, but only if they share. (As a mom, I was sort of rooting for the parents to demand more from Diego and Gabriela: fifty whine-free days and nights, cleaning, scullery work.)
</p>
<p>
Gabriela and Diego agree, secretly thinking, &#8220;But it will be more mine.&#8221;  They adopt a puppy from the humane society, and work hard housebreaking him.&nbsp; Diego discovers that the puppy, Sofie, will perform tasks in exchange for bites of tortilla.&nbsp; Sofie becomes well known around the neighborhood as the tortilla-loving dog.&nbsp; But one morning Diego discovers Sofie &#8220;barely moving,&#8221; and Mr. Dom&#237;nguez says, &#8220;Her nose is dry and hot.&nbsp; It&#8217;s supposed to be cold and wet.&#8221;  A trip to the vet is on order.&nbsp; Uh oh, I thought, maybe dogs aren&#8217;t supposed to eat tortillas?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But the tortillas turn out not to be to blame for this mysterious ailment.&nbsp; S&#225;enz amps the suspense of the puppy&#8217;s illness as far as a young child will want it to go.&nbsp; When I first read this book to my daughter, I thought, he&#8217;s not going to kill off the dog just a few pages after the kids adopted him, is he?&nbsp; He should save that for later in the series, <I>A Very Special Little Diego Book</I>.&nbsp; Thankfully, Sofie snaps back, with lots of care by her very responsible young owners.&nbsp; The clay illustrations are full of life, bringing out the personality of this much-loved pet.
</p>
<p>
Two other vividly illustrated bilingual books published by Cinco Puntos Press are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cynthiaweill.net/" title="Cynthia Weill">Cynthia Weill</a>&#8216;s <I><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cincopuntos.com/products_detail.sstg?id=149" title="Opuestos: Mexican Folk Art Opposites in English and Spanish">Opuestos: Mexican Folk Art Opposites in English and Spanish</a></b></I> (with sculptures by Quirino and M&#225;rtin Santiago, $14.95) and <I><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cincopuntos.com/products_detail.sstg?id=132" title="ABeCedarios: Mexican Folk Art ABCs in English and Spanish">ABeCedarios: Mexican Folk Art ABCs in English and Spanish</a></b></I> (with K.B. Basseches, sculptures by Mois&#233;s and Armando Jim&#233;nez, $14.95).&nbsp; Kids will love the supersaturated colors and lively personalities of the animals in these books, created by traditional woodcarvers in Oaxaca, Mexico.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I especially enjoyed the bright yellow leopard with wide orange eyes and toothy growling mouth to illustrate &#8220;Open &#8211; Abiertos&#8221; next to the closed-eyed, closed-mouth leopard for &#8220;Closed &#8211; Cerrados&#8221; in <I>Opuestos</I>, and the magenta-hooved Buffalo in <I>AbeCedarios</I>, who looks like he&#8217;s been taking lessons in flashiness from a toro.&nbsp; Also fun is the mystery &#8220;X&#8221; animal, with the body of a dog, feet of a lizard, tail and tongue of a snake and wings of a bat, with the text, &#8220;This is an undiscovered animal.&nbsp; Can you give it a name starting with the letter X?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
When teaching kids any language, it&#8217;s a wise idea to start with the words that will interest <I>them</I> most&#8212;try it, see how much quicker your kids can memorize the Spanish word for ice cream (<I>helado</I>) than the Spanish word for homework (<I>tarea</I>).&nbsp; The animal words and stories in these three books by Cinco Puntos Press are a good place to begin.

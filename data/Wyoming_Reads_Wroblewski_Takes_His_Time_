							<p>It seems like every week I have some new information to mention about bestselling Colorado writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="David Wroblewski">David Wroblewski</a>, so here&#8217;s today&#8217;s tidbit: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6594871.html?nid=2286&amp;source=title&amp;rid=706489063" title="Rachel Deahl of Publishers Weekly">Rachel Deahl of Publishers Weekly</a> reports: &#8220;&#8230;48-year-old debut author David Wroblewski has made an unusual request&#8212;he&#8217;s asked would-be producers to pitch their film ideas to him in person so he can choose who&#8217;s most deserving of the film rights. The unusual (and demanding) move, if nothing else, will make a quick acquisition unlikely.&#8221;  This seems to be characteristic of Wroblewski, who took over a decade to craft his hit novel.&nbsp; He continues to be more concerned with quality than speed.&nbsp; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://booksblog.guidelive.com/archives/2008/09/the-movie-of-edgar-sawtelle-re.html" title="Texas Pages">Texas Pages</a>.)

The September 11 edition of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12208693" title="The Economist">The Economist</a> reported that libraries and reading are thriving in Wyoming. (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2008/09/in-the-news-ray.html" title="The Book Bench">The Book Bench</a>.)  The article featured Burns, Wyoming&#8217;s library, noting, &#8220;This town of just 300 people has a public library containing 11,500 books.&#8221;   Other interesting items from the article:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The average Wyoming resident checked out nine books in 2005-06, compared with an average of five in California and two in Washington, DC.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In all, about three-quarters of Laramie County&#8217;s 86,000 residents hold library cards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In 2003, after more than ten years&#8217; work, the librarians managed to put an initiative on the county ballot that allocated $27m in additional sales taxes to the new building. Tax increases are always a tough sell in Wyoming, so the librarians were forced to find out exactly what the people of Laramie County wanted for their libraries, and give it to them. In southern Wyoming, at least, an excellent library system was not built in the face of resistance to public spending. The interesting truth is that it is excellent precisely because of it.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>

Since people in Wyoming love their books, it&#8217;s only fitting that Casper College will host what looks to be a top-notch literary festival this week.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.equalitystatebookfest.com" title="The Equality State Book Festival">The Equality State Book Festival</a> kicks off in Casper on September 18.&nbsp; The three-day event, which is in its 22nd year, features workshops, readings, and panels.&nbsp; Some of the highlights: On September 18, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_alexandra_fuller_part_one/C39/L39/" title="Alexandra Fuller">Alexandra Fuller</a> will speak about her work (7:30 p.m.), on September 19 author Gary Ferguson will give the keynote talk (6 p.m.), and on September 20 the &#8220;Making Up Stories in the West&#8221; panel features Laura Pritchett, Tina Welling, Robert Roripaugh, C.J.

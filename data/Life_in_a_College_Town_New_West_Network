							Today is the first day of classes at CU, and signs that the sleepy Boulder summer is over and the more bustling school year is underway are everywhere:<br />
<br />
My brother is a senior at CU Boulder and works in the freshman orientation office.  This week, he and his coworkers were trying to assist a young woman who was having difficulty locating a building in which she said she had been instructed to attend an orientation session.  When she said the name of the building was Braiden Hall, the orientation crew told her that it sounded familiar, but that it definitely wasn't  a CU building.  "Let me see your acceptance letter," one person asked her.  After looking at the letterhead, the mix-up became clear.  "Miss, I believe you've been accepted to Colorado State.  In Ft. Collins."  She had been looking for the CSU Student Union.  The mortified young lady's face dropped.  "But I just signed a lease!" she said, then fled immediately.<br />
<br />
The other day I was jogging on the Goose Creek Path, and I overheard a snippet of a conversation between two young men who were riding their bikes in the other direction.  "Short people look better snowboarding," one guy said to the other, "but tall people look better <i>skate</i>boarding."  The eternal debate continues to rage, apparently.<br />
<br />
Last weekend, the Target on 28th Street was packed with college kids shopping for items for their dorms and apartments, filling their carts with trash cans, brooms, and microwave popcorn.   My purchases made me feel like I was from a different planet: I was buying diapers.  The checkout clerk paused after she rung up the enormous load of the young man in front of me in line and sighed.  "It's been crazy all day."  She looked college-aged herself, but my old-lady tendencies got the better of me, and I replied, "It's all the kids back in town."  Soon I'll be shaking my fist at them.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of student renters moving into the condo complex where I live.  The other night, I came back from a stroll with my baby at about 8 o'clock, and I was thinking about all I had to do to care for her before my own 10 o'clock bedtime.  As I pushed my stroller  toward my house, I passed a scene reminiscent of a college quad: lots of young people hanging out on the lawn, talking, laughing and drinking.  Their night was just beginning as mine wound down.<br />

		<p>yikes! your first anecdote about the young woman who had her universities mixed up! Reminds me of a bad dream - the kind where you show up for your final exam and forgot to study. Or showed up in the wrong place. Or with only your pjs on. What a bummer for her! Just shows it pays to read the acceptance letter -- at least twice.</p>

		<p>As always Jenny, great article. How true my friend, how true . I was chatting with a former work colleague the other day about her son (who is starting his first semester at CSU). She told me kids now can order their books online! Gone are the days of starting off school in the enormous line at the bookstore waiting to buy books! My how college has changed!<br />
<br />
And every school year since I have been out of school has just been a reminder to me how far removed I am from that lifestyle now too, so I can relate. On nights when I could rage until 2 am, nights out end around 10 for me now. I have even shaken my fist from time to time too. (those darn youngins'!) Ah, maturity, and responsibility are lovely things eh?!</p>

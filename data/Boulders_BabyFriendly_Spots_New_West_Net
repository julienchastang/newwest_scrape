							<p>Since I had a baby last June, I feel like I see Boulder with a different pair of eyes. For example, I now notice when places are impossible to navigate with a stroller, such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://boulderbookstore.com" title="Boulder Book Store">Boulder Book Store</a> with its narrow aisles and flights of stairs with no elevators or ramps.&nbsp; (When I did have to take my baby to the upper floor, the employees there were kind enough to help me carry the stroller up, but I now try to leave my baby with my husband when I want to go there.)  There are restaurants and bars that I used to frequent that I probably won&#8217;t be able to visit for years to come.&nbsp; But on the flip side, I&#8217;ve discovered the child-friendly haunts of Boulder--those family-friendly restaurants like the Hungry Toad (2543 Broadway) where the crowd noise drowns out even the loudest tantrum, and places that are fun for kids.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
My eight-month-old craves constant stimulation--the days when she&#8217;d tolerate a whole day at home are over.&nbsp; The excursions don&#8217;t have to be elaborate or cost money.&nbsp; I recently strolled her over to Sturz &amp; Copeland (2851 Valmont Rd.), a delightful garden store and greenhouse.&nbsp; I&#8217;d never before realized how the winding paths among the plants and flowers could seem like a jungle to people under three feet tall.&nbsp; The weather is always great inside the store.&nbsp; Plus, there&#8217;s a bright green parrot that calls out &#8220;hello&#8221; in a variety of intonations, and a pool of goldfish.
</p>
<p>
This weekend we visited <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aqua-imports.com/" title="Aqua Imports">Aqua Imports</a> (2690 28th St.), a labyrinthine pet store selling fish, reptiles, and aquarium supplies.&nbsp; My baby was delighted with the wide variety of fish, lizards, and snakes that she could see at close range.&nbsp; She&#8217;s still to young for the zoo because she doesn&#8217;t notice when you try to point out an animal that&#8217;s yards away, but at this store she could get up close and follow the fish as they swam.&nbsp; There&#8217;s even an open tank where different types of corals are being raised, swaying in the current.
</p>
<p>
One of the top places in town for kids is the pool at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1261&amp;Itemid=453" title="North Boulder Rec Center">North Boulder Rec Center</a> (3170 Broadway).&nbsp; I&#8217;d looked in on the merriment going on for many years on my way to the gym, but it wasn&#8217;t until last week that I finally got to join in the fun.&nbsp; It features a very shallow area for babies, and gradually gets deeper until the end where there is a twisty waterslide worthy of an amusement park.&nbsp; There are spurting fountains, Rube Goldberg-like contraptions that pour water, slides, and a basketball hoop.&nbsp; My baby is too young for a lot of the activities the pool offers, but she had a blast watching the bigger kids splash around her. The pool is heated, so she didn&#8217;t shiver once even though we were in it for an hour.
</p>
<p>
My baby seems to be more of a social butterfly than I am, so we recently started going to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boulderparenting.org" title="Parenting Place">Parenting Place</a> (1235 Pine St.) where she can see other kids and play with lots of toys.&nbsp; They seem to have a group for every interest there--we&#8217;ve been going to the French-language baby group (9-11 a.m. every Monday), but there are also different times when Spanish, Japanese, and German speakers meet, and many different English-speaking groups divided by age of the children.
</p>
<p>
When all else fails, strolling on the bike path seems to keep the kid amused.&nbsp; She can watch cyclists and joggers zipping by, as well as plenty of curious dogs out for walks.&nbsp; Along the Goose Creek Path, there are ponds that attract ducks and geese, most of which are so bold that they&#8217;ll approach if you even make a gesture like you might have some crackers to offer.

		<p>Glad to see that "your bunny" is getting out to explore more with Mom's help :) And commend you on trying to satisfy an interest and curiosity with trips out instead of the easy "plop baby in front of TV, plop video in TV". All that plopping is too boring! :) Your cutie will know Boulder better than I do before she is 3!</p>

		<p>Jenny I am Cat's mother,<br />
I liked your blog .  I was looking for a gift for Max  on Firefox and came across your posting.  I am going to tell Cat about the Pine Street Group.<br />
Why don't you guys set up a meet up for babies.  I noticed another site that has meet up groups for everyone in Colorado but not Boulder <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fbaby-groups.meetup.com%2Fcities%2Fus%2Fco%2F">http://baby-groups.meetup.com/cities/us/co/</a></p>

		<h1>Boulder&#8217;s White Flight Problem</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 12-20-05</p>
			
			
							The <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> reported Monday on the increasing segregation in Boulder Public schools ('<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/education/article/0,1299,DRMN_957_4325739,00.html" title="'White Flight' in Boulder">'White Flight' in Boulder</a>).  It cited as one example the case of Columbine Elementary School, situated in a Boulder neighborhood that is 87% white.  However, the school's population is 82% Hispanic, suggesting that white parents in this neighborhood are doing everything they can to send their children elsewhere.  Richard Garcia of the Colorado Commission on Higher Education told the <i>Rocky</i>, "My feeling is the problem is racism.  I think people are leaving Columbine because they don't like to be with brown kids."<br />
<br />
As a white person who was educated from kindergarten through twelfth grade in predominantly minority Denver Public Schools, I have another theory: The white flight in Boulder is a case of liberals shooting themselves in the feet with an education policy that forces parents to scramble to find schools that will offer their children instruction that is appropriate to their abilities.  Tracking—an educational approach that allows for the separation of children into multiple reading and math levels at a given school in each grade—saved my life. But most Boulder Public Schools don't use tracking, largely because they fear it stigmatizes and limits children placed in lower-level classes.  <br />
<br />
Instead, most schools teach all children together in the same class, regardless of whether they are new to the English language or if they have above-grade-level abilities, a situation that's bound to leave kids on the high and low ends of the equation feeling frustrated.  This policy was started with the best, fuzzy-hearted intentions, to demonstrate that all children are equal, but it ended up forcing segregation.  There's nothing racist about parents seeking what they perceive to be the best education for their particular children—this was the same impulse that made my parents decide, when I was six years old, to allow me to be bused 45 minutes away to a North Denver school with a majority Hispanic population.<br />
<br />
The Denver Public Schools experienced massive white flight in the aftermath of the implementation of court-ordered busing to end segregation in the 1980's.  Those of us white people who stayed, however, stayed because the DPS offered so many accelerated classes and enrichment programs—a far better variety than could be found at most private schools.  I was tracked beginning in first grade into reading and math levels appropriate to my abilities.  I still attended most classes with students from a variety of aptitude levels, so I was not shut off from the diversity of the school.  <br />
<br />
On one day a week, students with good grades were allowed to attend a program at the University of Denver called "University for Youth," which I remember fondly.  As an elementary school student, I took classes in anatomy, the history of pirates, art, acting, and many other subjects taught by DU professors.  In high school, accelerated and AP classes were available in most subjects, but I still attended gym and art classes with the general school population, and my teammates on the track, basketball, and softball teams came from a spectrum of the school population.  Because of tracking, when I went to college at one of the most competitive private universities in the country, I felt I was an academic equal to the other students there, most of whom were educated at elite private prep schools.  My free DPS education enabled me to tackle St. Augustine and Plato alongside people who had spent top dollar for their educations.<br />
<br />
Because of my experiences growing up, to this day I still have many close friends of all different ethnicities, something that seems to me to be rare in Boulder, based on my casual observations of the way Boulder folk socialize.  Because I spent so much time in schools where Spanish was spoken first over the loudspeaker, or where I was one of the only non-African-American people in the room, today I am not only not uncomfortable attending events—such as concerts and religious services—where there are few other white people, but I feel at home in such places.<br />
<br />
According to the CSAP results, 83.2% of children attending Columbine are eligible for free lunch, an indicator of poverty.  Many of the children are recent immigrants to the United States, and Columbine offers bilingual instruction, which appeals to many Spanish-speaking families.  But English-speaking families often worry that putting their children in bilingual education programs will hinder their academic development. And they fear sending their children to schools like Columbine that are ranked "low" on the most recent state school report card.<br />
<br />
According to the <i>Rocky</i>, the Boulder Public Schools may be coming around to the tracking style of education to stem white flight.  "Pre-engineering and International Baccalaureate programs are slated for Centaurus High School…which has been trending Hispanic in recent years."  It's a good start, but if they want to keep the elementary schools integrated as well as the high schools, they need to offer different levels of instruction beginning in first grade.  When each school offers parents a choice about how to educate their children, parents won't have to send their children to a non-neighborhood school.  And, at the expense of sounding sappy, an integrated early childhood experience paves the way for a person to have an integrated life.

		<p>Look, say racism all you want, these days, racism is another way of saying "pay me". I send my kid to private school, and work my fingers to the bone to do it. You say "white flight" and "racism" are synonimous, yet both you and the press ignore so-called "white flight's" effect on city-wide economics. Fact is, with whites moving out of the ethnically diverse inner-city, it has eliminated a tax base that the city relies on to fund it's many expenses, hence why cities go bankrupt, schools decline, crime increases, as does poverty. Simply put, there's too many hands taking money out of the hat, and not enough putting it back in. Talk racism if you want, but if you scrub away politics and the "politically correct", and look at hard data, you'll see the truth. Better yet. Google the ten most dangerous cities in the US, and then the ten safest. Write the names down and search out demographic information on each one of them. See what I mean? Ever wonder why no one has publicized this? You see, you say white flight and talk racism to try and save your own a--, you know the truth as well as I.</p>

		<p>Thanks for your comment Ryan, but I think you should read my article again--I didn't accuse anyone of racism.  That word was used in a quote of Richard Garcia.  My article is a rebuttal to his view--I don't believe it's "racist" for parents to seek the best possible education for their children.  I've offered a solution to white flight and an option to parents such as yourself who must pay for a private education for your child.  If the public schools reinstate tracking, you wouldn't have to seek a quality education outside of the public system.  And Boulder doesn't exactly have an inner-city, so its problems would seem to be more easy to solve than those of large inner-city districts such as the ones you mention.  There's no "erosion of tax base" going on in Boulder.</p>

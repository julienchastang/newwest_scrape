		<h1>Book Festivals, Balls, and Events Fill in the Baseball Gap</h1>

							<p>After the Rockies clean sweep of the Diamondbacks in the National League Championships, do you find yourself at a loss about how to spend the eight-day layoff before the start of the World Series?&nbsp; Fortunately local literary groups had the prescience to anticipate the Rockies&#8217; historic tear, and scheduled a slew of events for this week.
</p>
<p>
For starters, Wyoming&#8217;s Casper College is hosting its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caspercollege.edu/events/literary/index.html" title="21st annual literary conference ">21st annual literary conference </a>from October 17-19,  and its theme will be &#8220;Spiritual Warriors.&#8221;  The eclectic lineup includes Nick Flynn, the author of <I>Another Bullshit Night in Suck City</I>, who will read and host a workshop on the enticing subject of &#8220;Bewilderment&#8221; (which perhaps the Diamondbacks should attend) and Ekiwah Adler-Belendez, a 19-year-old poet from Amatlan, Mexico, who has already published three poetry collections.
</p>
<p>
Don&#8217;t forget to participate in the One Book, One Denver program by reading Denver writer <a target="_blank" href="http://nickarvin.com/" title="Nick Arvin">Nick Arvin</a>&#8216;s powerful <i>Articles of War</i> before his culminating appearance at Manual High School on November 14.&nbsp;  (Trust me, you&#8217;ll like the book.)  There are plenty of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/onebook/Events/tabid/427923/Default.aspx" title="other events">other events</a> to attend along the way, including a World War II panel discussion at the LoDo Tattered Cover (October 27), a reading at the same location (November 8, 7:30 p.m.), and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/onebook/Events/WritingContest/tabid/427924/Default.aspx" title="writing contest for teens">writing contest for teens</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unco.edu/colopoets/news/announcements.html" title="Denver Mint Festival">Denver Mint Festival</a> will take place on Auraria Campus October 18 through 19.&nbsp; The event, sponsored by the literary magazine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.copper-nickel.org/" title="Copper Nickel">Copper Nickel</a>, will focus on poetry, with poets interviewing each other and reading their work.&nbsp; The exhibit &#8220;Manual Labors&#8221; will open at the <a target="_blank" href="http://belmarlab.org/" title="Lab at Belmar">Lab at Belmar</a> on Friday, and it will feature &#8220;contemporary poets responding to pre-Columbian artifacts,&#8221; including manuscripts by Kate Greenstreet, Noah Eli Gordon, Bin Ramke, Chris Ransick, Karen Volkman and 30 other poets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Denver Public Library&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://denverlibrary.org/about/support/ball.html" title="Booklover's Ball ">Booklover&#8217;s Ball </a>is on Saturday.&nbsp; The annual event raises money for books and materials, and this year it&#8217;s a &#8220;green tie gala&#8221; with an environmental theme.&nbsp; Organizers are encouraging attendees to buy carbon credits to offset their costs of travel to the event, to wear green bowties, and to &#8220;take a short shower &#8211; or share a shower with a friend!&#8221;  Who knew booklovers were so much fun?
</p>
<p>
And today marks the second annual &#8220;Colorado Poets Lend Their Voices,&#8221; in which local poets gather to record audio versions of textbooks for use by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rfbd.org/" title="blind and dyslexic">blind and dyslexic</a>. And despite their evident need, none of the recordings will be sent to the Phillies and the Diamondbacks.&nbsp; Sorry, that sentence was cocky and in poor taste.&nbsp; I&#8217;m beginning to sound like a Yankees fan.

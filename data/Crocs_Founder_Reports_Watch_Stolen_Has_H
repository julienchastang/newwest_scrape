		<h1>Crocs Founder Reports Watch Stolen; Has Hapa Patron Frisked</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 2-06-07</p>
			
			
							<p>There was an intriguing item in today&#8217;s Business Briefing section of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_5330851,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>: &#8220;Crocs founder and former CEO George Boedecker reported his $85,000 watch was missing as police questioned him about allegedly harassing customers at the Hapa Sushi Grill, 1117 Pearl St. in Boulder, on Feb. 3, according to a release from Boulder police. Police said officers were called to that location on a report of a disturbance and staff there indicated that Boedecker was harassing customers. Boedecker told officers that his watch had been stolen and he believed the man he was accused of harassing was the one who took it, according to the report. Officers did not find the watch or any indication that there had been any interaction between Boedecker and the other man before the confrontation. Police said no one wanted to pursue charges against Boedecker for harassment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
This begs the question: What was Boedecker doing flashing $85,000 worth of bling at <i>Hapa</i>?&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Hapa--it&#8217;s just that the casual sushi restaurant caters more to college students and hipsters than worldly millionaires.&nbsp; Yesterday, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5330782,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> reported that the watch was a  &#8220;$85,000 gold Roger Dubuis Reel Diver watch with a platinum lining,&#8221; and noted that Boedecker &#8220;was accusing a fellow patron of the grill as the one who took it. The patron, who said he knew nothing about the watch, allowed officers to frisk him and they found nothing. &#8220;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps next time Boedecker is selecting his wardrobe for a night out on the town he should ask himself the question: What would Warren Buffet wear?
</p>
<p>
This watch episode is only the latest of Boedecker&#8217;s adventures.&nbsp; In May of 2006, he was arrested after &#8220;a confrontation in the law office of his sister&#8217;s ex-husband, David Moorhead,&#8221; according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2006/06/" title="Daily Camera">Daily Camera</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Boedecker makes an interesting Google--one user of the gossip site <a target="_blank" href="http://dlisted.com/2007/01/04/she-would-buy-baby-crocs/all-comments/" title="dlisted">dlisted</a> made some unsubstantiated claims about him <a target="_blank" href="http://dlisted.com/2007/01/04/she-would-buy-baby-crocs/all-comments/" title="here">here</a>, which prompted another user to opine about Boulder residents in general: &#8220;Boulder cracks me up its all natural and beautiful and exercisey..but also the biggest drug addicts , dealers (an X of mine ) and drunks are from there and all have big bucks!&#8221;

		<p>The rich get richer and the poor get frisked. It's a scary place out there among the entrepreneurs. But then Boedecker's stock price (crox) has doubled over the past year and this is America home of self made men who work for the right to throw their weight around based on net worth. Boe is a big guy in or out of crocs as I have seen him pull his big car up beside the front door of the St. Julien and walk in as if it was his front door. The watch might be worth more than the car which leads me to think he may be just dumb enough to go hunting with dead eye Dick Cheney.</p>

		<p>I'd rather go hunting with Dick Cheney than driving with Ted Kennedy. (more Boulder bumper sticker rhetoric)</p>

		<p>This guy sounds like a real jerk, lots of people having a rough time these days and this guy goes around harassing people because he lost his 85K watch. Maybe next time he will get his ass kicked, fat piece of shit.</p>

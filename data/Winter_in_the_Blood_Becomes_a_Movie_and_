							<p>Filmmakers Alex and Andrew Smith (the sons of Montana writer Annick Smith) are adapting James Welch&#8217;s signature novel, <I>Winter in the Blood</I>, into a movie, according to a recent article in <a target="_blank" href="http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_41b6fd5c-1931-11df-b39a-001cc4c03286.html" title="the Missoulian">the Missoulian</a> (via <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/submishmash" title="Twitter.com/Submishmash">Twitter.com/Submishmash</a>). Jamie Kelly interviewed Welch&#8217;s wife Lois, who said that he had always dreamed of seeing <I>Winter in the Blood</I> become a movie. They hope to begin filming this summer in Montana, and will work with several actors with Montana ties, including Chaske Spencer and Lily Gladstone, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winterinthebloodfilm.com/#cast" title="cast list on the film's website">cast list on the film&#8217;s website</a>.

&#8226; Big news for Denver slam poetry fans: The Women of the Word Poetry Slam announced next year&#8217;s competition will take place in the Mile High City from March 8-11, 2012. According to the press release, this will be the first national poetry competition to be held in Denver, and it&#8217;s about time: Denver is home to the National Poetry Slam Champions of 2006, the Women of the World Poetry Slam Champion of 2008 (<a target="_blank" href=" http://www.andreagibson.org/" title="Andrea Gibson">Andrea Gibson</a>), and the Individual World Poetry Slam Champion of 2010 (Rudy Francisco). 
</p>
<p>
In addition to the competition, there will be a walking tour of Denver&#8217;s beat poetry history. (If you want to scout out the Denver beat route early, head over to this website, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.litkicks.com/Denver/BeatAuto.html" title="Neal's Denver">Neal&#8217;s Denver</a>.)

&#8226; I goofed a few weeks ago when I was discussing the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/bankrupt_borders_to_close_several_western_book_stores/C39/L39/" title="closing Borders stores">closing Borders stores</a> and wrote that Grand Junction, Colo. doesn&#8217;t have an indie bookstore&#8212;indeed, it has a fine one: Grand Valley Books (350 Main St.), which opened a year ago. I know it&#8217;s a good bookstore because they are hosting Marcia Hensley on March 23 (6 p.m.) for a reading from her eye-opening book <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/no_husband_no_problem_for_women_in_staking_her_claim/C39/L39/" title="Staking Her Claim">Staking Her Claim</a></I>, which won the MPIBA Book Award in 2009. Owner Margie Wilson let me know, &#8220;our store is plugging right along in spite of the Downtown Grand Junction UpLift project which has turned Main Street into a construction zone. Water mains, curbs and gutters, storm sewers, planted areas and sidewalks are all being replaced in a much-needed upgrade to the downtown area. It&#8217;ll be just wonderful when it&#8217;s finished.&#8221; Wilson also runs Twice Upon A Time Bookshop (2885 North Ave.) So head out to Grand Valley Books or Twice Upon A Time, Borders refugees.

&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thebookerynook.com/" title="The Bookery Nook">The Bookery Nook</a> in Denver (4280 Tennyson Street) is exhibiting some nude photos of Madonna taken in 1979. According to the explanation on the Shannon Piserchio photography website: 
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;In 1979, Madonna was living in New York and picking up work where she could as a nude model&#8230;she was paid $30 to pose for a class of about five photographers. One of those photographers was Martin Schreiber. In 1985, after seeing Madonna on the cover of Time Magazine, Schreiber sold his images of Madonna from that session in 1979 to Playboy and achieved instant fame and recognition. But whatever happened to the images that the rest of the photographers took?&nbsp; No one really knows. Until now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The photos turned up at the Camera Obscura Gallery (one of my very favorite places in Denver). For the rest of the story, visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shannonpiserchio.com/page12944.htm" title="Shannon Piserchio Photography website">Shannon Piserchio Photography website</a>, or go see the photos at The Bookery Nook. The photos will remain on display through April 28, when there will be a closing reception (7 p.m.).

&#8226; I&#8217;ll be discussing my novel <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jennyshank.com/the-ringer" title="The Ringer">The Ringer</a></I>, which hit bookstores this week, at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dwpconline.org/clubhouse_articles.php" title="Denver Woman's Press Club's">Denver Woman&#8217;s Press Club&#8217;s</a> March 21 gathering (5:30 p.m.).

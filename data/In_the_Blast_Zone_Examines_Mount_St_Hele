In 2005 a group of writers and scientists from Oregon and Washington gathered to spend a weekend camping near Mount St. Helens on the 25th anniversary of the volcanic eruption that rained debris on the surrounding area, destroying flora and fauna for miles around, leaving behind what looked like &#8220;a gray, lifeless landscape.&#8221;  But as the essays by the participants in this pilgrimage that are collected in the new anthology <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Blast-Zone-Catastrophe-Renewal-Helens/dp/0870711989/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1213149597&amp;sr=1-1" title="In the Blast Zone">In the Blast Zone</a></I> detail, all was not destroyed: burrowing gophers survived under the soil, while other plants and animals took refuge in &#8220;rotten logs, snow banks, and ice-covered ponds.&#8221;  Logging companies quickly moved to replant trees, but the Mount St. Helens Volcanic National Monument was established, allowing scientists to observe the natural recovery process that would ensue without human intervention.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
While many ecologists expected plant and animal life to move in from the fringes of the blast zone, what instead happened more rapidly was the burgeoning of tiny populations that had endured the tumult.&nbsp; The old growth forests were gone, the logs now bobbing on the surface of nearby Spirit Lake, but those who took the care to search for it could find lots of other life forms thriving.
</p>
<p>
Although this message of rebirth and renewal is the overriding one expressed by <I>In the Blast Zone</I>, there are some who still mourn for the mountain the way it was before the eruption, particularly those who had a personal connection to it, such as Ursula K. Le Guin, who writes in &#8220;Coming Back to the Lady:&#8221; &#8220;Mount St. Helens has been my neighbor for more than forty-five years.&nbsp; If I look straight north out the window at the head of our bed, she is the first thing I see in the morning, dark in the dawn twilight, or floating pale above the mist at sunrise.&#8221;  Le Guin watched from her window on May 18, 1980 as cloud cover cleared, revealing an &#8220;incredible column of dust and ash rising thousands of feet&#8230;over a blur of haze where the mountain had been.&#8221;  Sixteen months later, she and a group of friends &#8220;pulled a few governmental strings&#8221; and set off in a VW Bus up to see the mountain.&nbsp; Le Guin reports that &#8220;the scale&#8221; of what she saw there &#8220;was beyond comprehension,&#8221; and notes that she&#8217;s written about it but &#8220;never felt I could describe it adequately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Portland native Christine Colasurdo felt a similar sense of loss after the eruption, because her family owned a cabin near Spirit Lake and she grew up hiking in the area.&nbsp; Devastated, it took her years to visit the site again, which she wrote about in her 1997 book <I>Return to Spirit Lake</I>.&nbsp; Colasurdo, suffering from &#8220;a grief so strange it seemed more like vertigo than mourning,&#8221; eventually took comfort in the survival of a flower called pearly everlasting.&nbsp; She writes of the scientific characteristics of this flower, as well as its place in prior literature, noting that Thoreau derided it as being &#8220;artificial,&#8221; and that most tribes of Northwest Native Americans &#8220;have neither a name nor use for it.&#8221;  But Colasurdo develops a fondness for the tenacious flower, which is often &#8220;one of the first plants to revegetate a clearcut or burn.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The scientists in this volume tend to be more optimistic about the changes the eruption brought and genuinely enthusiastic about the opportunity to observe and record the aftermath of such a cataclysmic natural event.&nbsp; Charlie Crisafulli writes that the eruption &#8220;gave ecologists, myself included, unprecedented opportunities for studying how organisms initially respond to a complex ensemble of volcanic disturbance processes.&#8221; Scientist Jerry F. Franklin has spent half his career studying post-eruption Mount St. Helens, and writes that &#8220;This collaborative journey has moved me to continuously alter my views of ecological disturbances and the concept of &#8216;recover&#8217;&#8212;and the evolution of both landscape and mind continue!&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
There is one scientist, Nalini M. Nadkarni, who admits feeling a divide between the scientific and emotional parts of her brain in relation to Mount St. Helens.&nbsp; Nadkarni, who is a world-renown expert in epiphytes, &#8220;plants that grow on other plants,&#8221; was interested in studying the ability of epiphytes &#8220;to regenerate if they are removed or disturbed.&#8221;  As she discovered, it can take decades for mosses to make a comeback.&nbsp; But although as a scientist she was interested in observing the changes in the blast zone, &#8220;after a few days of seeing and stepping over and sleeping next to the trunks of so many dead trees, I felt an unexpected pool of deep sadness in my chest.&#8221;  Upon reflection, Nadkarni concludes, &#8220;Understanding and successfully communicating the importance of the links between nature and humans may lie in merging the complementary forces of science and poetry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Any reflection on a natural event as dramatic as the eruption of Mount St. Helens, which lingers twenty-eight years later in the minds of those who witnessed it, does seem to call for a blend of poetry and science such as the one provided by <I>In the Blast Zone</I>.

		<p>I had the job of getting loggers into a couple of Washington DNR timber sales.  They were sold lump sum,  and the courts decided that the purchaser had to take the hit.  So my first time to visit the sales was past Camp Baker, and up the South Fork Toutle river to the 3000 line,  and up  the ridge to Spud Rock where I parked.  And then with a compass,  and some dead reckoning,  the Mountain smoking on my right,  over the hill looking to find the equipment and landing I went.  A half mile from the truck,  walking on the backs of blasted over old growth trees,  like whale backs in an ocean of pumice dust,  I made my way down the long slope towards the Toutle river.  I hopped off one log,  intending to land on this other piece of wood,  which turned out to be a sleeping fork horned blacktail,  and that rodeo was an event for both of us.  Nothing green in sight, a clear March day 10 months after the blast,  and here is deer in the middle a monochromatic sea of debris and I had to step, no leap, on its back.  I survived and so did the deer,  which headed for the young reproduction timber over the hill from Spud Mountain.  <br />
<br />
A few days later,  my boss sent me to look at another DNR sale  being offered that had partial blast damage.  I parked in a turnout,  got out the map,  and followed a trail of ribbons down this hill toward standing green trees.  As if inscribed by a draftsman,  there was a direct line to the  Mountain delineated by absolute complete destruction on the west,  a short zone where the top halves of all the trees were missing,  and then green timber on the east side,  with no damage at all.  300 feet between certain death and sanctuary.  And that line ran for miles towards the Mountain.  Hiking out,  I remember seeing green in the blast zone in a memorable way:  individual needles growing out of the bole of a blasted yew tree.  Green hair on an unshaven diminutive tree trunk.  On the way up to the 3000 line,  and on to check on DNR and Weyerhaeuser road clearing,  I stopped when I saw dust puffs far away.  I stopped the pickup, and shut it off.  Picked up my binoculars,  and saw the dust puffs were from fallers bucking off logs that would raise a small debris cloud when they hit the ground.   In the clear mountain air,  it sounded like you were in a beehive,  but the buzzing was a hundred or more chain saws.  That was punctuated by the beep-beep-beep of whistle signals to cable logging engineers.  A great salvage effort was underway on State and private lands.  The Federal lands were left alone,  and today the private lands are a vast green forest of hundred foot or taller trees, and  the Federal lands are treeless willow patches filled with wildflowers and the stench of starved dead elk from the past winter,  no thrifty and thriving forest is to be seen.  Only the carcasses of millions of trees,  and deciduous brush.  In a hundred or more years,  it will change again,  perhaps burned by fire and cleared for future trees.  Memaloose.  I think that is the Chinook name for death or the place of death.  It should be the name of the Gifford Pinchot NF.  Memaloose Natl Forest.</p>

		<h1>Clear Channel Divides West; New Mexico Forms Musty Music Commission</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">

							According to a June 9 <a target="_blank" href="http://ttp://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/06-09-2005/0003828852&EDATE=" title="press release">press release</a>, music industry giant Clear Channel Entertainment has finalized its division the West: From now on, Bill Graham Presents will handle bookings in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, and Chuck Morris Presents will oversee musical events in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. Both companies will operate â€œunder the bannerâ€? of Clear Channel Music Group, so fans can still expect to pay the same great Clear Channel service fees and see the same acts that they are forced to listen to on Clear Channel-owned area radio stations. The addition of the two new entities makes for a grand total of 13 regional promotion firms in the â€œClear Channel Music Group family.â€?<br />
<br />
Chuck Morris has been a promoting force in Colorado for decades, and was one of the major players behind the conversion of the cavernous, acoustically-challenged Mammoth Events Center into the well-appointed Fillmore Auditorium. In 1998, Morris first partnered with San Francisco promoter Bill Graham, forming Chuck Morris Presents/Bill Graham Presents, a company that they sold to SFX in 2000. Clear Channel gobbled SFX the following year, and Morris has been an employee of the music giant since thenâ€”but now he gets to put his â€œChuck Morris Presentsâ€? logo at the top of press releases.  President Morris and his COO Brent Fedrizzi will continue to book the Fillmore, Red Rocks, and Universal Lending Pavilion, and Clear Channel will take over the booking of the Paramount Theatre from House Of Blues beginning August 1.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in New Mexico, Governor Bill Richardson recently established a New Mexico Music Commission to promote the stateâ€™s music industry, appointing former KOAT-TV reporter Nancy Laflin as its Executive Director. According to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.governor.state.nm.us/press/2005/may/050605_2.pdf" title="press release">press release</a>, the commission should have a website up and running by mid-June, but signs donâ€™t bode well for its cultural relevancy: According to the AP, the biggest music-industry name appointed to the commission thus far is Randy Travis (along with his wife and manager Elizabeth). The North Carolina native Travis owns a house in Santa Fe, and achieved his biggest success in the mid-â€˜80s. <br />
<br />
Lately Travis has served as a regular on the summer county fair country music circuit and recorded several gospel and religious-themed albums over the past few years. Also on the commission is Tony Orlando, who according to <a target="_blank" href="http://dsdsdemo2.ap.org/apentertainmentdemo/top_stories/16_ds_691129.html" title="the AP report">the AP</a> â€œdoesnâ€™t live in New Mexico but volunteered to help the state in its music promotion efforts.â€?  For those born within the last three decades who might not be familiar with Mr. Orlando, he is best known for his lush, fabulous hair and his 1973 chestnut, â€œTie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Ole Oak Tree." Has anyone in the governorâ€™s office even heard of Albuquerque indie pop stalwarts The Shins?  The band is probably New Mexicoâ€™s most critically and commercially successful musical export ever, and it has released all of its albums within the current century.

		<p>Hm, Tony Orlando? Wow. <br />
<br />
Re Colorado and Clear Channel, supposedly the company is cutting some rates on concerts to boost ticker sales. Have you seen any evidence of this? Also you think the proposed split of Clear Channel will have any impact?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Emily Esterson, 6-14-05</b>
		<p>Gov. Richardson is big on commissions. Film Commission, Sports Authority, Music Commission... Each one has their own share of Tony Orlando-types. Besides just a quick look at the summer lineup at the Casinos will give you an idea of the caliber of our music scene: <br />
ZZ Top<br />
Moody Blues<br />
Kenny Rogers<br />
The Village People.<br />
Donna Summer<br />
Rick Springfield <br />
Smokey Robinson<br />
The Gap Band<br />
Tony Orlando fits right in. (Thanks for mentioning the Shins)</p>

		<p>Hey, Kip Winger lives in Santa Fe. He's washed up enough to qualify for the commission. And the bassist for the Motels lives in Albuquerque.</p>

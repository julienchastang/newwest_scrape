	The girls and women in Aryn Kyle&#8217;s droll, astute story collection are apt to evaluate the social situation they find themselves in and calculate their actions based on what will gain them the most power or popularity.&nbsp; They might sleep with a married man or a man their father&#8217;s age, if only out of boredom.&nbsp; They might break up a couple or diss a downtrodden classmate.&nbsp; If they are employed, they don&#8217;t like their jobs or don&#8217;t try very hard at them.&nbsp; As the narrator of &#8220;A Lot Like Fun&#8221; discovers, she doesn&#8217;t have many useful &#8220;skills.&#8221;  Their mothers are dead, disturbed, depressed or distant, like the reclusive mother in Kyle&#8217;s perceptive and sensitive debut novel <I>The God of Animals</I>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But for all the commonalities among Kyle&#8217;s protagonists, each story in <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Boys-Girls-Like-You-Me/dp/1416594809/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1272061637&amp;sr=8-1" title="Boys and Girls Like You and Me">Boys and Girls Like You and Me</a></I> contains a fresh surprise, and I devoured them like candies I couldn&#8217;t wait to discover the middle of.
</p>
<p>
	Kyle, who grew up in Grand Junction, Colo. and studied creative writing at the University of Montana in Missoula, sets her stories, for the most part, in generic places that might be anywhere, but happen to be archetypal proving grounds of a girl&#8217;s heart and mind.&nbsp; There&#8217;s the Elementary School Classroom out of which no one escapes with her human decency intact, the High School Play where cast members&#8217; ambitions and lusts conflict, The Cruise Ship of Disillusionment, the Chain Bookstore where jerks shop and employees cavort, and the Bland College Town where Kyle&#8217;s protagonists evince cynicism about the prevailing norms, as in this passage from &#8220;Economics&#8221;:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the evenings, I sat on the balcony and smoked cigarettes, watching people come and go on the sidewalk below, looking for someone I could imagine myself falling in love with.&nbsp; The boys were all narrow-hipped and broad-shouldered, wearing baseball hats and T-shirts advertising sports teams and brands of beer&#8230;Sometimes I tried to picture myself kissing one of these boys or lying naked with one of them in bed, and then I would picture myself committing suicide.
<br />
Am I exaggerating?
<br />
I&#8217;m mostly exaggerating.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
	Kyle is an intensely psychological writer.&nbsp; At each turn of these stories, the reader is aware of the motivations and desires of each character, how they clash against each other, and of the protagonist&#8217;s thought process as she weighs her actions and makes her choices.&nbsp; This is especially true of the shrewd &#8220;Allegiance,&#8221; which Stephen King selected for inclusion in the 2007 <I>Best American Short Stories</I> anthology.&nbsp; The protagonist is a British fourth grader named Glynnis who has just moved with her family to the American town where her father grew up.&nbsp; The first day&#8217;s assignment is worm dissection and the teacher &#8220;partners her with Leora Faust, a girl with crooked teeth and patchy brown bruises on her knees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Although she is disoriented by the different mores of the American school, Glynnis quickly sizes things up and realizes she&#8217;s got to distance herself from the class outcast, Leora, and align with the most popular girls, both named Megan.&nbsp; Glynnis isn&#8217;t mean; she doesn&#8217;t want to pick on Leora, but the other characters force her hand, and above all Glynnis realizes what she has to do to survive.&nbsp; Meanwhile at home, Glynnis&#8217;s British mother is deeply depressed and clings to her daughter.&nbsp; She says of the Leora situation, &#8220;Some people just make it too easy.&nbsp; They make it too easy for people to be mean.&#8221;  Glynnis gradually learns the nature of the marital drama unfolding between her parents, which ultimately comes to a crisis on the same day her school drama has an important development.&nbsp; The reader watches, anxious to find out what Glynnis will choose, and then she makes her choice, a choice that will likely have implications for her relationship with her mother for years to come.
</p>
<p>
	&#8220;Take Care&#8221; is another illuminative story that, like a lot of Kyle&#8217;s stories, is funny and sad in equal measures.&nbsp; &#8220;Kate was sixteen and had been sent to stay with Claudia in Claudia&#8217;s college apartment while their parents figured a few things out, including whether or not they wanted to stay married to each other,&#8221; Kyle writes.&nbsp; Claudia is on suicide watch after her relationship with a professor sours.&nbsp; The university requires her to attend counseling.&nbsp; The sisters resemble each other, and tell each other everything, so Claudia persuades Kate to pose as her in meetings with her psychologist.&nbsp; The psychologist tells Kate as Claudia that she needs to get a job, so they both do, becoming receptionists for a down-at-the-heels dentist.&nbsp; Kyle deftly merges, and then separates, the sisters&#8217; personalities as the events unfold.
</p>
<p>
	<i>The God of Animals</i>  was translated into many languages and featured as a Costco book club pick, reaching a broad popular audience in part because of its appealing young narrator.&nbsp; Many of the stories in <I>Boys and Girls Like You and Me</I> also feature young protagonists.&nbsp; But Kyle&#8217;s work always feels like it&#8217;s intended for a mature audience, because there&#8217;s a lot of subversive stuff going on here, liars and masochists, dark humor involving a dead baby and an actor from a &#8220;pirate dinner theater&#8221; handcuffing his one-night stand, who, for her part, finds him boring.&nbsp; It&#8217;s clear Kyle isn&#8217;t writing to sell books or to please, she&#8217;s writing to work out these odd, surprising, and often universal narratives, and for that reason with <I>Boys and Girls Like You and Me</I>, she continues to be a writer who rewards a reader&#8217;s attention.

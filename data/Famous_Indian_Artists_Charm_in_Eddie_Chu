<p>
In one story in <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781574232165" title="Cheyenne Madonna">Cheyenne Madonna</a></I>, Eddie Chuculate&#8217;s wry and winning debut collection, Jordan Coolwater, the Creek/Cherokee protagonist of the book, sits with his girlfriend in Santa Fe&#8217;s plaza, selling handmade jewelry. &#8220;Tourists from New Zealand, Australia, or the U.K. would make the most braindead comments,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;wondering aloud where they &#8216;might find all the buffalo and teepees,&#8217; or &#8216;Where does the Trail of Tears start?&#8221; Such is the life of an Indian artist, which Chuculate depicts with wit, candor, and warmth. Jordan comes from a family that includes several artists, and one day this will also be his career, in between alcoholic benders and a stint in jail.
</p>
<p>
The book begins with the O. Henry Prize winning story &#8220;Galveston Bay, 1826,&#8221; which functions as a sort of prologue to the six Jordan Coolwater stories that follow. A band of four Cheyenne men make their way south on horseback to Galveston Bay to visit the ocean for the first time. &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t a war party or a scouting trip,&#8221; Chuculate writes, &#8220;This was plain-and-simple joyriding.&#8221; As they approach the ocean, they befriend the local Indians by offering their chief a horse. They enjoy seafood and taste the ocean&#8217;s salty water, but soon decide to ditch the remainder of their new friends&#8217; all-night dance party and return home. 
</p>
<p>
A hurricane strikes, and of the four only one, Old Bull, survives to tell the tale. &#8220;He embellished when telling the children, who were awestruck to hear of white men from different worlds who rode on big ships with billowing sails.&#8221; This story is appealing because it shows pre-contact Indians not as graceful, mythic, nature-loving, romanticized figures, but as regular dudes, who mess up and annoy each other.
</p>
<p>
Why did the hurricane strike these men down? As Chuculate writes in another story, &#8220;Whoever said things happen for a reason is a damned fool or an evolution theorist.&#8221; One hundred and fifty years later, we meet Jordan, who lives with his grandparents in Oklahoma on Creek land in the house of his great-great-grandfather, who survived the Trail of Tears. The elders are still embellishing the tales they tell the youngsters and going on joyrides through the country. Despite the facts that Jordan&#8217;s father is an absent alcoholic and his family lives in relative poverty ("For us, telephones were exotic, shining objects in other peoples houses&#8212;exotic like aquariums, color TVs, or doorbells"), his childhood is a contented one.
</p>
<p>
Jordan spends summer days &#8220;watching the clouds stream overhead like silent ships,&#8221; fishing for turtles, playing for &#8220;the youthful lifetime of so-so baseball teams,&#8221; and welcoming whatever company happens to visit his grandparents&#8217; house. In each story a different charismatic character enters Jordan&#8217;s life and takes the spotlight. First comes YoYo, a trash-talking black high school track star who moves into a big house nearby with her parents. Chuculate writes of his black characters&#8217; thoughts about Indians, and his Creek characters thoughts about black people with refreshing honesty: &#8220;[Jordan] wondered what black folks did in their houses all day.&#8221; The story takes several startling turns as Jordan and YoYo&#8217;s friendship develops suddenly into a romance.
</p>
<p>
The characters who have the biggest influence on the way Jordan turns out, however, are his uncle, Johnson L. Freebird, the star of &#8220;A Famous Indian Artist,&#8221; &#8220;the best Indian artist in the state of Oklahoma,&#8221; and his dad, who figures in &#8220;Dear Shorty.&#8221; As a kid, Jordan eagerly awaits the next time Johnson blows into town: &#8220;Johnson L. would magically appear on the front porch&#8212;seemingly without benefit of car, truck, or even bike. He was just <I>there</I>. Johnson meant action, meant pizza, pop, baseball cards. He meant trips to town, rides in the country, talk of Old Mexico. He always wore a black cowboy hat, smoked sweet-smelling cigars and talked of old &#8216;Whar-Ez.&#8217;&#8221; Johnson L. is larger-than-life, and he and Jordan enjoy some epic adventures.
</p>
<p>
In the funny, melancholy, &#8220;Dear Shorty,&#8221; Jordan reflects on his relationship with his dad, who has been a homeless alcoholic for most of Jordan&#8217;s life. &#8220;My dad is the only person I know who could get drunk three, four times a day. Watching him get drunk was like watching one of those time-lapse films where snow melts, grass sprouts, flowers bloom and then wither away all in a few seconds with clouds rushing overhead and shadows underneath.&#8221; But Jordan doesn&#8217;t write him off, because Shorty is also charming and funny. &#8220;By chance, he ran into my sister at the clinic in town just after she had her first baby. &#8216;He&#8217;s got your eyes,&#8217; she said. &#8216;Red?&#8217; he inquired.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<I>Cheyenne Madonna</I> leaves you wanting more stories of this family&#8217;s oddball adventures, their best laid plans that always go awry, and their unexpected ways of expressing love for one another. Eddie Chuculate writes with authenticity and he displays a storyteller&#8217;s gift for spinning wild, compelling yarns.

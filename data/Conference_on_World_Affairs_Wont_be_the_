							<p>Organizers and attendees of CU&#8217;s annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/information.html" title="Conference on World Affairs">Conference on World Affairs</a> received some sad news recently: Roger Ebert, who has appeared at the Conference for 37 years running, is too ill to attend this year.&nbsp; As the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5395661,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News ">Rocky Mountain News </a>reported today, &#8220;Ebert had surgery in June to remove a growth on his salivary gland; two weeks later, an artery burst near the surgery site, lengthening his recovery time.&#8221;  Ebert&#8217;s appearances have always been one of the conference&#8217;s biggest draws.&nbsp; According to Greg Glasgow of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/mar/02/ebert-miss-conference-world-affairs/" title="Daily Camera">Daily Camera</a>, Ebert&#8217;s &#8220;Cinema Interruptus,&#8221; in which he stops a film repeatedly to answer audience questions and discuss it in detail, will continue &#8220;under the direction of Jim Emerson, a Seattle-based critic who runs Ebert&#8217;s Web site. &#8220;
</p>
<p>
In addition to discussing film, Ebert often sat on a variety of panels, and usually had a book signing and film discussion at the Boulder Book Store.&nbsp; I was thoroughly entertained every time I went to see any of Ebert&#8217;s Boulder appearances.&nbsp; I was struck by his intelligence, wit, and generosity, qualities that seemed to shine through even more clearly in his freewheeling talks than on his television show.&nbsp; I know I&#8217;m not the only person in Boulder who wishes Ebert a continued recovery and a quick return to La Dolce Vita.&nbsp; The conference runs April 9-13 at multiple CU campus venues, but it won&#8217;t be the same without Ebert.

							Boulder rockers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rosehilldrive.com/" title="Rose Hill Drive">Rose Hill Drive</a> have been packing the house at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxtheatre.com" title="Fox Theatre">Fox Theatre</a> almost since the group's inception, but tonight's performance will be an especially triumphant one as the band finally has a debut full-length to promote (9 p.m., all ages, $17.50 admission includes a copy of the CD).  The self-titled disc has become one of the most hotly anticipated releases by a Colorado band in recent years.  <br />
<br />
Rose Hill Drive formed six years ago when its three members (brothers Jake and Daniel Sproul and Nathan Barnes) were in high school, and quickly began attracting attention as a crack live act playing straight-ahead rawk--sort of a power palate cleanser amidst Boulder's glut of jam bands.  But you don't have to take my word for it--their publicity materials boast a rave from no less a rock authority than Pete Townshend, who said, "With hair flying and the volume turned up to 11, their live show is not to be missed."  Earlier this summer, Townshend interviewed RHD for his internet program, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/" title="<i>In The Attic</i>"><i>In The Attic</i></a>.<br />
<br />
Now in their early twenties, the members of RHD have plenty of touring and recording experience under their belts, even though the new self-titled disc is their first album to be released.  As soon as RHD began playing around town over three years ago, record labels began courting them, which lead to a recording session with respected producer Brendan O'Brien (best known for his work with Pearl Jam and Rage Against The Machine).  They decided to scrap the recording session when they weren't satisfied with the results, and started writing a new album from scratch.  Early this year, they returned to the same recording studio, Southern Tracks in Atlanta, and came up with an album they feel confident in.<br />
<br />
The twelve-track disc shouldn't disappoint Rose Hill Drive's fans--it manages to capture much of the group's live energy, with relentless guitars, arena-ready vocals, and song titles and lyrics such as "Brain Novocaine," that are perfect for face-melting.  RHD previously offered a live version of "Cool Cody" for New West's Local Music Shakedown, which <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/MP3s/rosehilldriveCoolCody.mp3" title="can be heard here">can be heard here</a>.  The band will spend September touring the U.S., then head over to the U.K. in October.<br />

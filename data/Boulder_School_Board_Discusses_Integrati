		<h1>Boulder School Board Discusses Integration Proposals</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>

							Berny Morrison reports in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> today (<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/education/article/0,1299,DRMN_957_4432203,00.html" title="Boulder considers proposals to boost integration">"Boulder considers proposals to boost integration"</a>) that Boulder's school board is attempting to address the problem of increasing segregation in the town's schools.  Latinos tend to cluster in schools like Columbine Elementary that offer bilingual education—and also happen to be the district's lowest performing schools on standardized tests—while white parents opt to send their kids to higher-performing schools, whether they have to pay for them or not.  Morris writes that if a proposal is carried out, "Students entitled to free or reduced-cost lunches could receive open-enrollment preference at more affluent - and mostly Anglo - schools as part of a plan to boost ethnic and class integration. Minority students would receive free transportation to the mostly Anglo schools, and English language instruction would follow them to their new schools. Neighborhood students would not be displaced." <br />
<br />
 This approach might prompt more Latino students to open enroll in predominantly white schools, but as I wrote earlier, (<a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/4921/" title=""Boulder's White Flight Problem"">"Boulder's White Flight Problem"</a>), the schools won't become truly integrated unless the school board offers tracking, which separates children according to their ability levels to better challenge the high-performers and help the low-performers.  Until then, you can expect that wealthy parents will send their kids to private school if that's their only option for a high-quality education for their children, and segregation will continue.

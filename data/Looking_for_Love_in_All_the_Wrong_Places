	The title story of Missoula writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cas.umt.edu/english/creative_writing/faculty/canty.html" title="Kevin Canty">Kevin Canty</a>&#8216;s new collection <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Money-Went-Kevin-Canty/dp/0385525850" title="Where the Money Went">Where the Money Went</a></I> sets the tone and theme for the book, with its wry, sad-funny accounting of a busted-up marriage.&nbsp; &#8220;When the thing was over, Braxton sat down at the kitchen table of his apartment and tried to figure out what they had done with the money,&#8221; it begins.&nbsp; In less than two pages, Canty provides a clear picture of this family that formed, consumed, and then dissolved, spending money on &#8220;cars, landscaping, clothes, vacations&#8221; on its way out of existence.&nbsp; Most of the stories revolve around a lonely male narrator who made a hash of some prior romantic relationship or is about to trash his current one.&nbsp; It would all be pretty depressing if Canty wasn&#8217;t so funny.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	&#8220;The Birthday Girl&#8221; serves as an example of Canty working at his best.&nbsp; It kicks off with a vivid, immediate start: &#8220;Saturday Night at the Sip &#8216;n&#8217; Dip: Piano Pat is bellowing out her 35,000th rendition of &#8216;Take Me Home, Country Roads&#8217; while the college boys and girls&#8212;home for Christmas, stuck in town till New Year&#8217;s&#8212;suck mixed drinks off the piano-top bar and sing along.&nbsp; It&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock or ten-thirty and the snow is coming down like a freight train outside.&nbsp; I get a Daniel&#8217;s ditch to go and take it back to the room, not without regret.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Our narrator, it&#8217;s easy to surmise from the first sentence, is less carefree than those college kids.&nbsp; He&#8217;s got to get back to his motel room, where his teenage son, Justin, waits for his mother to come retrieve him after a visit, but she&#8217;s snowed in at the Salt Lake airport.&nbsp; Justin tells his dad that his mom is planning to remarry, sees that the news hits him hard, and then tells him it&#8217;s okay if he wants to go back to the bar.
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohairemotorinn.com/?p=sipanddip" title="The Sip 'n Dip">The Sip &#8216;n Dip</a> is an actual bar in Great Falls, Mont., with a window that looks out onto a pool where mermaid shows are held.&nbsp; &#8220;You can look this up,&#8221; the narrator reports.&nbsp; But there are no mermaids this night, just a drunk, reasonably attractive woman who declares that it&#8217;s her birthday and a hefty couple making out in the pool: &#8220;Both of us sip our drinks and watch the underwater couple, back behind the bar.&nbsp; The magnifying effect of the water makes their legs look huge, like manatees.&nbsp; They might know we&#8217;re watching but they might not.&nbsp; In the blue light, their giant legs twine together.&nbsp; God knows what their upper halves are doing but their legs can&#8217;t seem to stop touching.&#8221;  The narrator has every reason to leave and pass the remaining time with his son quietly in their room, but of course he doesn&#8217;t, because Canty&#8217;s characters specialize in digging themselves deeper holes.
</p>
<p>
The theme of real estate, driven by the three D&#8217;s (death, divorce, and diapers), is another current running through the book.&nbsp; In &#8220;The Emperor of Ice Cream,&#8221; Lander&#8217;s divorced dad is trying to sell a Montana mansion to a couple that &#8220;looked fit and rested and eager&#8212;like eager golden retrievers held under restraint, Lander thought.&nbsp; He was afraid they were going to jump up and lick him.&#8221;  In &#8220;The Boreal Forest,&#8221; the narrator is out in the Montana wilderness and he reports, &#8220;If the weather ever broke, there would be hundred-mile views into Idaho from here.&nbsp; Million-dollar views is what the real-estate people would call them.&#8221;  In &#8220;No Place in This World for You,&#8221; the narrator is a realtor in Tucson who is trying to convince a non-committal couple to buy a house while his dissatisfied wife exercises compulsively and his four-year-old son gets everyone in trouble for biting other kids at daycare.&nbsp; In &#8220;Sleeping Beauty,&#8221; a bachelor narrator invites his friends, two married couples, over for dinner to see his newly renovated apartment.&nbsp; The evening plays out a little like Raymond Carver&#8217;s &#8220;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love&#8221; if there were an extra guy, a fifth wheel, thrown in.
</p>
<p>
Although the stories sometimes feel like they&#8217;re shambling along, with one incident leading to another, their satisfying endings reveal that all their moving parts have been working in concert; they often have a classic shape that reminds you of the story-writing rules laid out by past masters.&nbsp; In addition to echoes of Carver, there&#8217;s a detail in &#8220;No Place in This World for You&#8221; that seems to follow Chekov&#8217;s gun rule--"One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it,&#8221; Chekhov wrote to a friend.&nbsp; But in Canty&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s loaded his story with a biting preschooler named Walter who delivers a fateful chomp at the perfect dramatic moment.&nbsp; &#8220;The world hates a biter,&#8221; the narrator reflects internally to his son, &#8220;and my love cannot protect you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Canty&#8217;s prior two short story collections were set all over, but most of the tales in <I>Where The Money Went</I> take place in Montana or other parts of the West.&nbsp; Canty introduces a new element to his fiction with stories in which the Western landscape plays an integral role, as in &#8220;In The Burn,&#8221; in which a forest fire fighter whose girlfriend is about to break up with him takes his girlfriend&#8217;s son to see a burn area, and &#8220;The Boreal Forest,&#8221; in which a scientist heads out to the snowy Montana woods to research lynx.&nbsp; It&#8217;s as though hanging out with all the nature writers in Montana has rubbed off on Canty.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
But then the scientist spends most of his time in the woods thinking about how he cheated on his wife with her best friend, so it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re still in Canty country, which isn&#8217;t such a bad place to be as long as you&#8217;re not married to one of his protagonists.&nbsp; There&#8217;s longing, love, loss, betrayal, too much drinking, and a whole lot of post-divorce change-of-address forms to fill out there, but at least Canty keeps you laughing along the way.

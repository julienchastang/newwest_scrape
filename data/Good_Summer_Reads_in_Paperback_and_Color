							<p>In time for economical summer reading, two of my favorite novels of 2009 are out in paperback this month: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_vestal_mcintyre/C39/L39/" title="Vestal McIntyre">Vestal McIntyre</a>&#8216;s <I><a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/vestal_mcintyres_lake_overturn/C39/L39/" title="Lake Overturn">Lake Overturn</a></I> (available now), and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jimlynchbooks.com/" title="Jim Lynch">Jim Lynch</a>&#8216;s <I>Border Songs</I>, which hits bookstores July 13.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
McIntyre grew up in Yampa, Idaho, and <I>Lake Overturn</I> is set in the fictional Idaho town of Eula.&nbsp; Boy did I gush over that book&#8212;I wrote: &#8220;Lake Overturn is a Novel with a capital N&#8212;it does everything that great novels have always done: entertaining, transporting, edifying, and ultimately satisfying the reader, and McIntyre has written it with incredible heart.&#8221; <I>Lake Overturn</I> won several awards and was a New York Times Book Review Editor&#8217;s Choice, and a Washington Post Best Book of 2009, not to mention one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_five_best_books_in_the_west_of_2009/C39/L39/" title="top 5 Western books of last year">top 5 Western books of last year</a>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In my review of Jim Lynch&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/patrolling_the_northern_border_jim_lynchs_border_songs/C39/L39/" title="Border Songs">Border Songs</a></I>, I wrote, &#8220;Strange things are going on around the border between Washington state and British Columbia in Jim Lynch&#8217;s rich, imaginative novel&#8230;Quirky, funny, fresh, and lyrical, <I>Border Songs</I> will win over just about any reader.&#8221;  <I>Border Songs</I> was picked as one of the best books of the year by the Washington Post, Toronto Star, St. Louis Dispatch, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/new_west_best_books_in_the_west_2009_part_2/C39/L39/" title="New West">New West</a>, among others.&nbsp; Lynch will be in Missoula at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitiesmontana.org/BookFestival/bookfest.php" title="Montana Festival of the Book">Montana Festival of the Book</a> in October.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; The winners of the 2010 Colorado Book Awards were announced at the Aspen Summer Words Festival recently.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve featured many of the books that rose to the top here on New West.&nbsp; According to the <a target="_blank" href="  http://www.gjsentinel.com/entertainment/articles/book_notes_june_27_2010 " title="Grand Junction Sentinel">Grand Junction Sentinel</a>, 146 books were entered in the 13 categories this year.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s nice to see <I>A Dozen on Denver: Stories</I>, the anthology of Denver fiction that Patti Thorn, Books Editor of the Rocky Mountain News, put together just before the newspaper ended its 150-year run was the winner in the Anthology/Collection category.&nbsp; That anthology also has a design that is just about my favorite one of last year, with mountains and Denver&#8217;s skyline embossed directly on the cover.&nbsp; (I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks this: the cover, by Margaret McCullogh, won PubWest&#8217;s Gold Award for design).&nbsp; The Colorado Book Award win is a welcome memorial to the Rocky.

		<b>Comment By Jim Van Pelt, 7-07-10</b>
		<p>Hi, Jenny.  Thanks for mentioning the Colorado Book Awards.  The ceremony itself was in Aspen and very nicely done.  I blogged about my impressions of it at <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fjimvanpelt.livejournal.com%2F267485.html">http://jimvanpelt.livejournal.com/267485.html</a></p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-07-10</b>
		<p>Congratulations on the award, Jim.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Kim Anderson, 7-08-10</b>
		<p>Couldn't agree with you more about Border Songs. We're thrilled to have Jim at the Montana Festival of the Book, along with Brady Udall (The Lonely Polygamist), Jess Walter (The Financial Lives of the Poets), Kevin Canty (Everything) and over 50 other authors. I hope someone will blog the Festival! <br />
<br />
Thanks for continuing to provide the best coverage of Western literature out there.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-08-10</b>
		<p>Kim,<br />
<br />
That sounds like a great lineup for the Montana Festival of the Book, as usual.  What I like best about the four writers you mentioned is that they are all funny.  I hope this is a new trend in Western literature.</p>

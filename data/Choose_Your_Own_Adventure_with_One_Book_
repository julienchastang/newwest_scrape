							<p>Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper is trying a new approach with this year&#8217;s One Book One Denver selection&#8212;he&#8217;s letting people vote on what book they want to read from a list of 27 books that cater to almost every possible interest group, save those who would like to see a Colorado author selected.&nbsp; It looks like a reading list for high schoolers getting ready to take A.P. English&#8212;it has that whiff of enforced homework about it.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of books I love on the list, including a couple of my all-time favorites: Zora Neale Hurston&#8217;s <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God</I>, Tolstoy&#8217;s <I>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</I>, and Mark Twain&#8217;s <I>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</I>.&nbsp; But even these beloved books don&#8217;t have the appropriate feel you need to rally people around a community book program.&nbsp; The choice should be a book that everybody hasn&#8217;t already read, something that is fresh, interesting, and perhaps a little controversial.&nbsp; Hasn&#8217;t everyone already read <I>To Kill A Mockingbird</I>?&nbsp; One frequent community reading pick is T.C. Boyle&#8217;s <I>Tortilla Curtain</I> (not on the list), which brings up the topics of illegal immigration and development run amok.
</p>
<p>
To vote, you need to get a user name and password from the <a target="_blank" href="http://onebookonevote.org" title="One Book One Denver">One Book One Denver</a> homepage.&nbsp; I&#8217;m leaning toward a couple of my girls: Willa Cather&#8217;s <I>My &#193;ntonia</I>, and Louise Erdrich&#8217;s <I>Love Medicine</I>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve loved Cather since I was a kid, and have even made a pilgrimage out to Red Cloud to see where she grew up (Plus my mom comes from a family of Bohemian immigrants to Nebraska, like &#193;ntonia).&nbsp; But Erdrich is one of the most compelling fiction writers working today.&nbsp; I wish they would have picked something newer from her--<I>Love Medicine</I> was Erdrich&#8217;s first novel, published in 1984, and she&#8217;s been writing so many great ones recently, including 2001&#8217;s <I> The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse</I> and her most recent novel, <I>The Plague of Doves</I>.&nbsp; But it looks like to make it on this list, a book had to be at least semi-canonized.
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s one book that&#8217;s not on the list should be there&#8212;Kent Haruf&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I>.&nbsp; Several people in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/books/ci_12522507" title="Denver Post's recent article about the program">Denver Post&#8217;s recent article about the program</a> pointed out this glaring omission, and I&#8217;m adding my voice to that chorus.&nbsp; If there was ever a perfect selection for One Book One Denver, it&#8217;s <I>Plainsong</I>.&nbsp; I interviewed Haruf last year, and he seemed to think that Hickenlooper has chafed under people&#8217;s constant request for this book to be featured.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what he said when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/one_book_one_everywhere_community_reading_programs_in_the_west/C39/L39/" title="I spoke to him in February of 2008">I spoke to him in February of 2008</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;All of the choices have been pretty good,&#8221; Haruf said, &#8220;but they need to figure out how to do it better than they&#8217;ve been doing it, so it can get the attention it deserves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Haruf mentioned that the program&#8217;s refusal to select Plainsong &#8220;is water under the bridge at this point,&#8221; and that the book has been featured by many other cities and towns across the country in their community reading programs.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My complaint would be that the mayor&#8217;s office has some final say on it,&#8221; Haruf said.&nbsp; &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a dangerous thing, always, to have politics involved in the determination of what&#8217;s art and what art should be available to the public.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The subversive thing to do would be to start a write-in campaign to get <I>Plainsong</I> selected.&nbsp; There&#8217;s no place on the online form for people to list their own choices, so I guess the best way would be to email the mayor at <script type="text/javascript">

I omitted at least one regional literary conference in last week&#8217;s roundup (and I&#8217;m sure there are more): The <a target="_blank" href="http://jacksonholewritersconference.com" title="Jackson Hole Writers Conference">Jackson Hole Writers Conference</a> will be held from June 25 through 28 and will feature Tony Earley, Julia Glass, Chris Crutcher, Ravi Shankar, and Craig Johnson, among others.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/the_count_of_le_wyoming_craig_johnson_heads_to_france/C39/L39/" title="Craig Johnson">Craig Johnson</a>, there was a weird profile of the Wyoming writer in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/garden/04cabin.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=ucross%20writing&amp;st=cse" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> this week.&nbsp; The article begins from the angle of real estate, describing the wooden cabin Johnson and his wife built near Ucross.&nbsp; Then Joyce Wadler delves into Johnson&#8217;s background--Johnson&#8217;s writing bio mentions that he was once a police officer in New York City.&nbsp; When Wadler found no record of Johnson&#8217;s service with the NYPD, she questioned him about it.&nbsp; Wadler writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Responding to questions about these discrepancies by e-mail, Mr. Johnson at first ignores the issue of what he did in the 25th and 23rd Precincts and suggests dropping any reference to his law enforcement career. In later e-mails and one long conversation, he explains that he took classes in the New York City police stations that were &#8216;civil service oriented and was constantly recruited by the police department,&#8217; but that after a knee injury he chose to work as a special officer attached to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Since he &#8216;carried a gun and had a badge, and all my paraphernalia had the logo of the N.Y.P.D.,&#8217; Mr. Johnson says, he was &#8216;under the impression it was a detachment of the N.Y.P.D.&#8217; His work at the 25th and 23rd Precincts, he says finally, was for community services and the Police Athletic League. &#8220;I had no intention of misleading anyone,&#8221; he says.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
This &#8220;discrepancy&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem that grave to me, but journalists for the New York Times probably feel a lot of pressure to question people&#8217;s biographies after the paper has had so many screw-ups of this nature.&nbsp; Wadler noted that he responded &#8220;petulantly&#8221; to her inquiries.

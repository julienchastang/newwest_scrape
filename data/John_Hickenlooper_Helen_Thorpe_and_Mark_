		<h1>John Hickenlooper, Helen Thorpe, and Mark Spragg Discuss Books with Western Booksellers</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 9-30-09</p>
			
			
							<p>The final day of the 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mountainsplains.org/" title="Mountains and Plains Independent Bookseller Association">Mountains and Plains Independent Bookseller Association</a> Trade Show in Denver, Saturday, September 26, featured a breakfast with presentations by four authors to benefit literacy organizations in the region.&nbsp; Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper introduced his wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_helen_thorpe/C39/L39/" title="Helen Thorpe">Helen Thorpe</a>, the author of <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/growing_up_illegal_in_denver_helen_thorpes_just_like_us/C39/L39/" title="Just Like Us">Just Like Us</a></I>, describing how each of them were initially reluctant supporters of the other&#8217;s chosen career path.
</p>
<p>
Hickenlooper explained that Thorpe is &#8220;as much of an introvert as I am an extrovert,&#8221; and said she had consented to his run for mayor because &#8220;she would meet people through the process of the campaign that she would never otherwise meet,&#8221; and because there &#8220;was absolutely no way in God&#8217;s green earth that I would ever win.&#8221;  During the campaign, when Hickenlooper went ahead in the polls, Thorpe looked over her copy of the Rocky Mountain News at him and said, &#8220;You never told me you were going to win.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Hickenlooper described <I>Just Like Us</I> as &#8220;a book about four Hispanic girls whose parents are illegal immigrants,&#8221; adding, &#8220;as an elected official, that&#8217;s not the topic you&#8217;d choose for your wife to write.&#8221;  But he became more enthusiastic as he realized she could &#8220;create a narrative that was as compelling as fiction, with characters that grow on you and unfold, just as in a novel.&nbsp; To witness this was one of the most rewarding processes, more rewarding even than getting elected mayor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Hickenlooper continued, &#8220;She won&#8217;t say this, but there&#8217;s a little sex in this book,&#8221; though it mostly occurs off stage.&nbsp; He concluded by describing Thorpe as &#8220;one of the greatest authors alive.&#8221;  Thorpe said, &#8220;Are the other authors going to have their spouses introducing them?&nbsp; It&#8217;s highly unfair.&#8221;  Thorpe explained that at its core, her book is about identity.&nbsp; &#8220;When you&#8217;re growing up in this country and you don&#8217;t have papers, the fact of being illegal and undocumented is a burden you carry as you&#8217;re figuring out how to form an adult identity.&nbsp; It makes coming of age particularly complicated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://muttscomics.com/" title="Patrick McDonnell">Patrick McDonnell</a>, the author of the comic strip <I>Mutts</I> and many books for young readers presented his new book <I>Wag</I>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allisonhooverbartlett.com/" title="Allison Hoover Bartlett">Allison Hoover Bartlett</a> discussed her nonfiction story about an antiquarian book thief, <I>The Man Who Loved Books Too Much</I>.
</p>
<p>
The event concluded with a presentation by Mark Spragg.&nbsp; It was clear from his reception among the booksellers that Spragg is one of the most popular writers of this region. MPIBA President Andy Nettel introduced Spragg&#8217;s forthcoming novel <I>Bone Fire</I> as &#8220;a can&#8217;t-miss IndieBound pick.&#8221; The novel, which Knopf will publish in March, picks up the story of several characters from Spragg&#8217;s previous novels, including Griff Gilkyson from <I>An Unfinished Life</I>.&nbsp; Nettel said that in an early interview, Spragg cited Kent Haruf, Jim Harrison, and Cormac McCarthy as influences, and now younger authors are claiming Mark Spragg as an influence.
</p>
<p>
Spragg discussed his book, which took him five years to write, saying that like Thorpe&#8217;s book, <I>Bone Fire</I> includes sex as a subject.&nbsp; &#8220;I tried to get quite a lot of sex into <I>Bone Fire</I>, but I want to assure you that it&#8217;s literary sex and that no one truly enjoys themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Spragg described his Wyoming childhood.&nbsp; He grew up in a national forest with no television or radio, and that instilled in him &#8220;a love of horses, science, and books.&#8221;  His father made Spragg and his brother prepare monthly book reports, with an oral presentation and a written report due the following day.&nbsp; Spragg said his father &#8220;read for argument,&#8221; and so he assigned his sons books such as those by Kierkegaard and Marcus Aurelius.&nbsp; Spragg said his father believed there &#8220;are only two great themes: our deaths and our couplings in the face of that inevitability.&#8221; Spragg&#8217;s mother loved poetry, so when she picked the assigned books, she chose selections by Whitman and Frost.
</p>
<p>
When he was a boy, Spragg kept journals with &#8220;long passages of descriptions of the landscape, scraps of dialogue, and endless passages of wondering about death and sex.&nbsp; The same things I write about now.&#8221;  His family drove into Cody once a month for shopping, and his parents would drop Spragg and his brother off at the library.&nbsp; &#8220;I literally considered the library evidential of an afterlife,&#8221; Spragg said.&nbsp; He found a note his mother had made in a baby book, which said that when she asked him at age eight what he wanted to be when he grew up, he said he &#8220;planned to be a novelist.&#8221;  Years later, Spragg said, &#8220;I&#8217;m still addicted to the struggle of narrative and enchanted with the surprise of writing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Spragg concluded by thanking the independent booksellers in the audience.&nbsp; &#8220;If it were not for books,&#8221; he said, &#8220;many of you would have gone out into the world and made a decent living.&#8221;  He said his editor at Knopf, Gary Fisketjon believed, &#8220;If it were not for independent booksellers, Knopf would have to change its list or it would go out of business.&#8221;  A visibly moved Spragg continued, &#8220;You&#8217;ve given me the hope that I&#8217;m not wasting my life, and I thank you for that.&#8221;

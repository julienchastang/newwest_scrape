							<p>Missoula-based writer Deirdre McNamer&#8217;s fascinating new novel <I>Red Rover</I> tells the story of the unexplained death of a Montana man shortly after he returned from serving in South America with the FBI during World War II, and the ongoing lives of the family, friends, and acquaintances that survived him.&nbsp; McNamer will discuss the book tonight  at <a target="_blank" href="http://kingsenglish.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&amp;eventId=351829" title="The King's English">The King&#8217;s English</a> in Salt Lake City (August 20, 7 p.m.), and at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp;jsessionid=abcdbIUyKCMpY4w1w1iqr?s=storeevents&amp;eventId=353181" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a> in Denver on Tuesday, August 21 (7:30 p.m.).&nbsp; I recently interviewed Deirdre McNamer via email about the true events that inspired the novel, the structure of the book, the subtlety of her writing, and her experience as a member of a family of writers.
</p>
<p>
<b>NewWest: I read that <I>Red Rover</I> is based on events in your own family that you were initially researching for a nonfiction book.&nbsp; Which aspects of <I>Red Rover</I> are based on facts you uncovered in your research?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Deirdre McNamer:</b> The answer to that question is dealt with at some length in the <a target="_blank" href="http://booksellers.dk.com/static/rguides/us/red_rover.html" title="Penguin author interview online">Penguin author interview online</a>. In brief, I had an uncle who joined the FBI and was sent during WWII on an undercover assignment to Argentina. A year after the war he was found dead of a shotgun wound in his Missoula apartment. The coroner told the newspaper it was suicide, but she filed a death certificate that listed the death as an accident and gave a different location for the shot than she had given the newspaper. The FBI file concluded the death was an accident. The family was only told it was apparent suicide and only recently learned what was on the death certificate and in the FBI file. So this book is an attempt to posit a scenario for what might have happened and why.
</p>
<p>
Other factually based chapters are the first one&#8211;two young boys riding their horses to the Sweet Grass Hills &#8211; which is something my father and his brother liked to do. And the second chapter, about flying B-29s during WWII, is based on my father&#8217;s experiences as a pilot during the war. The family&#8217;s trip to Missoula after learning of their son and brother&#8217;s death is also pretty close to how it happened.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How and when did you decide that fictionalizing this story was the best way to proceed?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> After working on it for a couple of years, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t going to get to the factual end of the story. Secret agencies like the FBI know how to keep their secrets. Also, many people who might have known something about my uncle&#8217;s death are now dead. Also, when I was trying to write it as nonfiction, I felt constrained. What a relief it was, finally, to call it fiction, make it fiction, and have all the freedom that fiction gives you &#8211;the freedom to inhabit character&#8217;s minds, to introduce new characters, to write with a sense of exploration, trusting that the sentences themselves, written well enough, will somehow have the power to create a fictional story that feels, to the reader, like felt experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: <I>Red Rover</I> covers a large swath of time, and has a fairly large cast of characters, but your page count is a very economical 264, and the prose has the concision of poetry.&nbsp; How did you achieve this?&nbsp; Did you carve the current book from a larger manuscript, or had you lived with the characters for so long that you could explain a lot about them in a few sentences?</b>
<br />
 
<br />
<b>DM:</b> I wrote this book in sections and then moved the sections around to try to achieve the sort of tension I wanted to convey. I wrote and rewrote and rewrote, until each sentence, virtually, was the way I wanted it. It didn&#8217;t ever get much longer than it is now, but it took me quite awhile to &#8220;load up&#8221; those relatively few pages so that the entire, complete, somewhat complicated story got told in a satisfying way.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: The chronology of <I>Red Rover</I> is scrambled, which enhances the mystery.&nbsp; Did you write it in its current order?&nbsp; How did you decide how to structure the chapters and parts?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> Basically, the book is organized as a sort of excavation, each section going a layer deeper into the personalities, motives, actions and secrets of the characters involved. A given section might contain several characters and various times, but my thought is that a certain layer of knowledge is offered to the reader via those people and times And then a new layer is reached with the next section.
</p>
<p>
 I scrambled the chronology for exactly the reason you note, that the story&#8217;s suspense and mystery are enhanced by doing that. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Why did you decide to organize the first section of the book around Lindbergh&#8217;s visit to Montana?:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> Well, at the beginning of a book a reader is looking to orient herself or himself. At that point, this book&#8217;s characters are living lives apart from each other, but their lives will ultimately intersect. I wanted to hint at a connection-to-come by having four of the characters see Lindbergh on the same day in 1927, in different parts of Montana.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Opal Mix is a great character.&nbsp; How did you come up with her?&nbsp; Her marriage with Porter is unusual as well--what was the inspiration for this?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> Writing this book started with a question I was left with after reviewing the circumstances and documents relating to my uncle&#8217;s death. The coroner clearly lied&#8212;either to the newspaper or on the death certificate she filed. So the question is: Why would a person do that? That question launched my efforts to create a believable fictional character with believable motives, and I wanted to make her both unlikable and unforgettable. So I spent a lot of time with that character. I also thought about what it might have been like to be in a marriage in the 1930s that was essentially closeted, in terms of how the man and woman really related to each other.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You very much respect the intelligence of your readers.&nbsp; There were several passages that were so subtle I had to reread them, such as the oblique suggestion (on page 97) that Opal suffered abuse at the hands of her uncle, and in a few places (I think) suggestions of homosexuality that were never fully spelled out (such as when Whitcomb thinks of himself as a &#8220;damp match.").&nbsp; Or maybe I&#8217;m just a prurient reader and inventing these undertones!&nbsp; Why did you decide to mention these incidents with such subtlety?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> You&#8217;re not inventing them. Porter Mix is homosexual, and Whitcomb is bisexual. Opal felt threatened by her uncle. But I didn&#8217;t want those aspects of their lives to usurp the story, to take center stage, so I didn&#8217;t shine a spotlight on them. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Many of your characters in this book die and/or suffer from unusual ailments (peritonitis, toxemia, se&#241;or lobo).&nbsp; How did you come up with their diseases?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> I&#8217;m interested in autoimmune diseases and sudden, completely unexpected, deaths, because both things seem so cruel and whimsical, in a sense, and we humans have a hard time getting our minds around random-seeming cruelty and the big cosmic surprise.
</p>
<p>
<b>How important do you think the Montana setting of your book is to the way the characters and the story develop?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> It&#8217;s what I know, certainly, but I also think the Montana landscape and weather have a kind of unfashioned grandeur, a largeness, to them, to the extent that they almost become characters on their own. So they populate the book, in a sense. On the other hand, many parts of the story itself could have happened anywhere.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You mention in your acknowledgments page that you read your father&#8217;s diary to help you re-create the wartime B-29 bombing missions.&nbsp; Did your father speak about his time at war much?&nbsp; Did you ever interview him about it?&nbsp; Did he want you to have his diary?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> He didn&#8217;t talk much about it until he went to a reunion of his bomber wing in the 1980s, and I pumped him for information about who was there and what they all had done during the war. He was a pilot of a B-29, flew 31 missions over Japan, was decorated. He gave me the diary of his war experiences because it ends with the death of his brother, and he knew I was writing something that had to do with that death. It was a very generous thing for him to do, and the diary itself is very precise and moving.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Is your father a writer, too?&nbsp; What is it like to be a writer in a family of writers?&nbsp; Do you and your sisters help each other with your drafts?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> My father isn&#8217;t a professional writer, but he and my mother are both fine natural writers. Both of my sisters, Kate Gadbow and Megan McNamer, are published writers and very good ones. We don&#8217;t help each other with drafts but we read and admire the finished work of each other. It&#8217;s great to be in a family of writers and readers. Talking about books is something we&#8217;ve always done and continue to do. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What are you working on next?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>DM:</b> A novel. I&#8217;m excited about it but feel I&#8217;ll jinx it if I say more.

Lockerbie, Drugs and the CIA <br />

"The covert operators that I ran with would blow up a 747 with 300 people to kill one person. They are total sociopaths with no conscience whatsoever." - Former Pentagon CID Investigator Gene Wheaton<br />
<br />
On 21 December 1988, Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland. 270 people died.<br />
<br />
Minutes before flight 103 took off from London's Heathrow airport, FBI Assistant Director Oliver 'Buck' Revell took his son and daughter-in-law off the plane. [1001] <br />
<br />
Revell was an associate of Lt. Colonel Oliver North who was linked to Iran-Contra. .[1002]<br />
<br />
North was a business associate of Syrian arms and drug runner Monzer al-Kassar. [1003]<br />
<br />
Al-Kassar was closely linked with Rifat Assad, brother of Syrian ruler Hafez Assad. Rifat was married to the sister of Ali Issa Dubah, chief of Syrian intelligence, who, along with the Syrian army, controlled most of the opium production in Lebanon's Bekka Valley.? [1004]<br />
<br />
Reportedly, al-Kassar was involved in shipping heroin from Lebanon into the USA.<br />
<br />
Reportedly, al-Kassar's drug route to the United States was protected by the CIA. [1006]<br />
<br />
The American Drug Enforcement Agency "was already using Pan Am flights out of Frankfort, Germany, for controlled delivery shipments of heroin." [1006]<br />
<br />
A team led by Major Charles McKee of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Matthew Gannon, the CIA's Deputy Station Chief in Beirut, traveled to Lebanon to try to get some hostages released. [1012]<br />
<br />
According to Juval Aviv, the Lockerbie investigator for Pan Am, McKee's team discovered the illegal CIA drug operation and refused to participate.<br />
<br />
According to Aviv, McKee contacted the CIA headquarters but got no reply. McKee and Gannon, against orders... decided to fly home to blow the whistle.<br />
<br />
According to Aviv: 'They had communicated back to Langley the facts and names, and reported their film of the hostage locations. CIA did nothing. No reply. The team was outraged, believing that its rescue and their lives would be endangered by the double dealing.<br />
'By mid-December the team became frustrated and angry and made plans to return to the U.S. with their photos and evidence to inform the government, and to publicize their findings if the government covered up.'<br />
<br />
Reportedly Ahmed Jibril (founder and leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command ) had a base near Frankfort. Reportedly, Jibril had links to al-Kassar.<br />
<br />
Reportedly bomb maker Marwan Abdel Razzack Khreeshat was part of Jibril?s cell. On 26 October Khreesat was arrested and one of his bombs seized. Then Khreesat was mysteriously released. [1009]<br />
<br />
Former CIA agent Oswald Le Winter stated, "pressure had come from Bonn from the U.S. Embassy in Bonn to release Khreesat." [1010]<br />
<br />
Reportedly, Khreesat worked for U.S. intelligence. [1011]<br />
<br />
Allegedly, one of Khreesat's bombs was used to bring down Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie.<br />
<br />
McKee, Gannon and five other members of their team were killed when Pan Am flight 103 came down over Lockerbie.  [1013][1014]<br />
<br />
~~<br />
<br />
After the crash<br />
<br />
A member of a mountain rescue team said: "We arrived within two hours [of the crash]. We found Americans already there." [1023]<br />
<br />
According to George Stobbs, a Lockerbie police inspector, "[I] started to set up a control room, and [between] eleven o'clock and midnight, there was a member of the FBI in the office who came in, introduced herself to me, and sat down  and just sat there the rest of the night. That was it." [1024]<br />
<br />
Tom Dalyell, a member of British Parliament, stated: "Absolutely swarms of Americans [were] fiddling with the bodies, and shall we say tampering with those things the police were carefully checking themselves. They weren't pretending, saying they were from the FBI or CIA, they were just 'Americans' who seemed to arrive very quickly on the scene."<br />
<br />
Dalyell recalled: "It was odd and strange that so many people should be involved in moving bodies, looking at luggage, who were not members of the investigating force. What were they looking for so carefully You know, this was not just searching carefully for loved ones. It was far more than that. It was careful examination of luggage and indeed bodies." [1027]<br />
<br />
Dr. David Fieldhouse, the local police surgeon, identified Major McKee's body. "I knew that [the identification of] McKee was absolutely correct because of the clothing which correlated closely with the other reports and statements, and the computers that were linked up to Washington." [1028]<br />
<br />
Jim Wilson, local farmer, told relatives of Pan Am victims that he was present "when the drugs were found." Wilson discovered a suitcase packed with heroin in one of his fields. <br />
<br />
One Scottish police officer said that his department had been told to keep an eye out for the drugs early on. <br />
<br />
Lockerbie Bombing Case Faces U-Turn after Perjury Confession<br />
<br />
<br />
20 August 2007, Monday<br />
<br />
The Lockerbie bombing case, which has often been linked to the trial of the six Bulgarian medics in Libya, is about to make a historic U-turn after a key witness confessed to perjury, Darik radio reported. <br />
<br />
Ulrich Lumpert, a Swiss electronic engineer and former employee at the Zurich-based MEBO Ltd Telecommunication, has admitted that he stole from the company a hand manufactured MST-13 Timer PC-Board that was later used as evidence against the defendant, Libyan agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi. <br />
<br />
The confession was made in a letter sent to dozens of organizations and individuals, including Darik radio journalist Svetoslav Ivanov. <br />
<br />
The hand-over happened on June 22, 1989.<br />
<br />
Megrahi was found guilty in 2001 of the bombing of a Pan Am flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, which killed 270 people. He is serving a life sentence in a Scottish prison but in June won the right to launch an appeal. <br />
<br />
Lumpert, who was summoned to testify as witness No.550, says he did not know , that the MST-13 Timer PC-Board was used for a specific purpose in connection with the attack on PanAm 103.<br />
<br />
"I have been living in an indescribable condition of depression of and fear since my second examination by the police in 1991," Lumpert says in the letter.<br />
<br />
He claims he was shocked when he was shown the photograph with the apparent MST-13 Timer fragment by the "BUPO", FBI and the Scottish Police, for the first time in mid January 1991.<br />
<br />
"They confronted me with the fact that this MST-13 Timer fragment was found in Lockebie and was part of the ignition device of the suitcase with explosives, which caused the Boeing 747 PanAm Flight 103 to crash," Lumpert recalls.<br />
<br />
"When I realized that the MST-13 PC-board, after it was handed over by me without permission was misused for deliberate politically criminal "action", it was clear to me that I was stuck "in the middle of it" and decided to keep quiet, for it could have been extremely dangerous for me as an unintentional "bearer of secrets".<br />
<br />
"I am sorry for the consequences of my silence at that time for the innocent Libyan Mr. Abdelbaset Al Megrahi, sentenced to life imprisonment, and for the country of Libya," says Lumpert's letter, which has been officially certified in Switzerland.<br />
<br />
It concludes with a call for putting an end to the accusation that Libya is responsible for the Lockerbie Tragedy by "manufacturing" MST-13 Timer-Link with criminal intent.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of August the son of Libyan leader Seif al-Islam told French newspaper Le Monde there was a link between the case of the jailed agent, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, and Libya's freeing last month of six foreign medics convicted of deliberately infecting Libyan children with HIV. Al-Islam said Libya will soon have an extradition agreement with Britain and stressed he was confident of his early return.<br />

MOTION TO AMEND CIVIL COMPLAINT<br />
<br />
PURSUANT TO RULE  15 (a) <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
   Plaintiffs move that this complaint be amended to reflect that Defendant Theodore Shackley is deceased and that his Estate now be named a co-defendant to this action. 3<br />
<br />
      Plaintiffs move that the complaint filed under 42 USC 1983 be amended to include violations of 18 U.S.C. 1962, 1964(c), The Racketeer Influence & Corrupt Organization Act of 1970, henceforth referred to as RICO.  Plaintiffs assert that the Defendants named herein constituted, at minimum, an Association-in-Fact type of enterprise, that the Defendants were associated together for a common purpose to obstruct justice, silence and destroy Plaintiffs, depriving them of  life, liberty, reputation, and lifetime income under color of law.  In actual fact Defendants were involved in an enterprise known as TD-WAVE,  established to dissemble, discredit, demonize, financially destroy,  and silence anyone, including the Plaintiffs, who could possibly link the Central Intelligence Agency ( C.I.A.) to the bomb that brought down Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, December 21, 1988.<br />
<br />
      To establish a conspiracy claim under RICO, the Plaintiff must allege existence of an enterprise.  The Enterprise concocted by the Defendants is herewith identified. However, an Association-in-Fact Enterprise is enough.4 <br />
<br />
      This original complaint was filed September 7, 2004, just 10 months after the CIAs conspiracy and true connection with the Libyan regime  was exposed in the Southern District of Texas.5<br />
<br />
      The horrific truth behind the Defendant?s covert capabilities came to light  October 27, 2003, more than 14 years after the terrorist attack.  Agents of the United States and their co-conspirators clear motive to persecute, incarcerate and silence the Plaintiffs, and others, was finally exposed6.  Retired CIA officer, Edwin P. Wilson claimed from his solitary prison cell that he had been working for the CIA when his company, International Consultants shipped 20 tons of  plastique explosives from Houston, TX  and trained the Kadaffi Regime to blow up things like airliners.  <br />
<br />
      Wilsons partners in International Consultants were CIA Director of Counter-Intelligence, Theodore Shackley, and retired Air Force General, Richard Secord, both named as defendants in this litigation.<br />
<br />
            Plaintiffs, and others who seek to join this suit, are former United States intelligence agents, renowned journalists, writers, authors, and film producers who have been persecuted, demonized, and silenced, subjected to physical and mental abuse, and in the case of one, whose estate has joined this suit, met an untimely death at the hands of  Defendants.  Defendants to this action, under color of law, sought to silence the Plaintiffs and others to cover the true role of the Central Intelligence Agency in actions that lead to a terrorist bomb to be placed aboard Pan American flight 103, December 21, 1988.<br />
<br />
      Plaintiff: Oswald LeWinter is a Nazi Death Camp survivor, a former Central Intelligence operative, nurtured  under the wing of CIA Spymaster, James Jesus Angelton, who appeared in the film, The Maltese Double Cross.  His research supported  the CIAs attempted cover-up of the connection between the Agency and the truth behind the bombing of Pan Am 103.  LeWinter was arrested, and imprisoned in Vienna, Austria on similar charges as Plaintiff, Lester Coleman, for possessing forged documents April 22, 1998, while meeting with British financier, Mohammad Al Fayad.  LeWinter was carrying documents provided to him by CIA, TD-WAVE operative, Patrick McMillian of Las Vegas, NV7, that claimed to evidence a plot behind the death of Fayad?s son, Dodi, and Princess Diana, killed in a car crash in Paris, France, August 30, 1997. LeWinter  resides in Germany,  recovering from surgery.  Patrick McMillian is also previously described as one of the Unknown Central Intelligence Agents, in the original complaint submitted September 7, <br />
<br />
      Plaintiff:  Lester K. Coleman has an extensive background in the Middle East.  He is a journalist and author with numerous accolades including an Emmy and the International Edward R. Murrow Award.  He appeared on NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw, the night after the bombing,  linking a CIA renegade, Edwin P. Wilson to the plot.  He then appeared in the film, The Maltese Double Cross, a year after a book about him, Trail of the Octopus, was published in paperback edition by Signet Books re-affirming the Wilson connection8.  Coleman was a  Agent with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, [ HUMINT/ ISA-MC-10 ]9 involved in classified activities. After his revelations in the Pan Am bombing, while suffering from cancer, he was brutalized and abused, interrogated using noise and flashing light therapy, moved about the country 16 times while illegally held for 154 days in federal custody.  This is affirmed by sworn affidavits from two Deputy United States Marshals, and in a federal TORT settlement.10 Two principles to this abuse while held in federal custody are Defendants Victor Martinez and William Austin, both fired in 1997 by  Defendant, Federal Bureau of Prisons. Coleman was thereupon re-arrested for possessing forged documents, July, 1999 by local authorities in Lexington, Kentucky, acting on a complaint from Defendant Central Bank & Trust of  Kentucky in a blatant effort to silence,  demonize, and ultimately destroy  him, in consort with co-defendants named herein.  <br />
<br />
      His charges were concocted by CIA/ TD-WAVE operative James P. Vasillos  to place checks drawn on overseas banks into Colemans CBT account and then clear them on deposit11. Vasillos is previously listed as one of the Unknown Central Intelligence Agents , defendants in this action.  CBT has a  long history of involvement with CIA defendants, further detailed later in this complaint.<br />
<br />
2004.<br />
<br />
           LeWinter and Coleman were named as potential witnesses in the trial of two Libyans in Zeist, Holland.  Their timely arrests and detention effectively prevented them from appearing at trial to give testimony.  Solicitors representing one of the accused, Kalid Feimah came to the United States and interviewed Plaintiff Coleman while he was held in custody, over objections of federal authorities.  Feimah was found innocent of all charges against him.            <br />
<br />
      Plaintiff: Alan Francovich Estate.  A year earlier to the day, Film maker, Allan Francovich dropped dead at the hand of TD-WAVE while attempting to clear U.S. Customs in Houston, Texas, April 22. 1997.  Francovich wrote and produced the film documentary, The Maltese Double Cross that played in 16 countries, including on British Network TV4.  He had arrived from London tracking the Wilson connection, for a projected revised version of his documentary that clearly exposed the U.S. intelligence cover-up of circumstances leading to the Pan Am 103 disaster.  His research depicted how the bomb was actually placed aboard the Pan Am flight,  the CIA role as provider of expertise in building a bomb inside a Toshiba Radio.  Francovich also was to meet with Mm. Dominque Demeil, who represented  a CollegioVaticano society that had funded his past productions, including an expose of the CIA, On Company Business, which documented the CIAs overthrow of the Salvador Allende government in Chile; replacing it with the ruthless Augusto Penochet regime, now exposed as world-class mass-murderers.  <br />

STATEMENT OF COMPLAINT <br />
<br />
<br />
      Defendant Theodore Shackley [ Estate ] died at his home in Bethesda, MD on December 12, 2002.  Shackley rose to Assistant Director, Counter-Intelligence at the CIA until he was forced out in an Agency shake-up by incoming Director Central Intelligence, Stansfield Turner.  Shackley pretended to retire in 1979, a classic feint by clandestine operatives and counter-insurgency specialists.  In actual fact, Shackley went about creating a network using his principle protege, Vincent Cannistraro,  his long-time partner-across-the-Potomac, FBI Director of Counter-Intelligence, Oliver Buck Revell, and co-defendant, General Richard Secord.  After Shackleys official departure from the CIA in 1979, Cannistraro rose to take his mentors position as Director, Counter-Intelligence.  In  true Shackley tradition, Cannistraro also pretended to retire from the CIA in 1989, a year after the bombing of Pan Am flight 103.  TD-Wave officially went off the books with his departure.<br />
<br />
      TD-WAVE was actually re- activated  the day after the bombing of the Pan Am Clipper, Maid of the Seas. Its sole mission was to bury the connection between the CIA [ namely Shackleys numerous Enterprises] and the Libyan regime of Muhammar Kadaffi.  The TD-WAVE Enterprise was spawned from  Shackleys  earlier covert operations at the CIA Station in Miami that dated back to the early 60s.<br />
<br />
      TD-WAVE  had established a CIA proprietary company behind the Iron Curtain identified as ZIBADO, 36 Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, German Democratic Republic ( East Berlin).  The principle proprietor of ZIBADO was well known Middle East terrorist, Abu Nidal.<br />
<br />
      Nidal recently died in Baghdad, before the U.S. invasion.  He left behind copious journals filled with vibrant accounts of his activities as a CIA asset, including ZIBADO, and the involvement of Shackley, Cannistraro, Revell, and Lt. General Richard Secord, USAF (Ret.) 12 ZIBADO was the principle conduit to move $ millions that was used by TD-WAVE to train Libyan hit squads and others including Ahmed Jibril and his PFLP-GC, based in Damascus, Syria.  The Nidal, Libyan,  and Jibril connection with TD-WAVE is personally known by CIA Operative, Dr. Richard Fuisz, who was a NOC  [Non-Official Cover ] based in Damascus during the years prior to the bombing of Pan Am flight 103.  Dr. Fuisz will so testify to these assertions. The training and arming of terrorists cells was classic Shackley, to effectively counter terrorists by covertly coddling  them.<br />
<br />
      After the bombing of Pan Am 103, TD-WAVE moved to keep the lid on Wilsons sanctioned relationships with Libya, and the CIAs  contacts with Nidal and Jibril to train them on building bombs inside boom-box radios.13    After assuring the silence of Allan Francovich by his death when arriving in Houston on a flight from London14, TD-WAVE moved on to silence two key characters in Francovichs film, The Maltese Double Cross.   <br />
<br />
      TD-WAVE operative, Patrick McMillian  was used to snare former CIA Operative, Oswald LeWinter in a devious trap to discredit and silence him.  LeWinter, like Coleman, had been named in 1991 as a potential witness to appear in Zeist, Holland,  in the case against two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am 103. McMillian devised a scheme in 1998 using forged documents, provided to him by TD-WAVE, that claimed the death of Princess Diana and her boyfriend, Dodi Fayad15  was a British Intelligence plot.  He offered LeWinter a piece of the profits from the sale of the information to Dodi Fayad?s Father, Egyptian Financier, Muhammad Al Fayad.  A meeting with Fayad was arranged in a Vienna, Austria hotel.  During the meeting Viennese police, assisted by U.S. FBI Agents, under Oliver Revells direction,  swooped down and arrested LeWinter.  He was charged with possessing forged documents.  Patrick McMillian returned  to Las Vegas, but not before using a unique bank-book account16 from  Katherein Bank, Acct. No. 50307495 ,and  flying to Casablanca, Morocco.  Nidal?s journals are reported to list this account under the name of  his company, ZIBADO.<br />
<br />
      Six months later, the other key figure in the Francovich film, former Defense Intelligence Agent,  Lester K. Coleman was arrested in a hotel eight thousand miles away, in Lexington, Kentucky, July, 1999.  Local police swooped down on him accompanied by federal agents, and charged him with possessing forged documents, mainly foreign bank checks that appeared in his account at Central Bank & Trust of  Kentucky, cleared on deposit.   His arrest was the work of TD-WAVE operative, James P. Vassilos 17 with the cooperation of the bank.18  <br />
<br />
      The ruthless campaign would have worked if not for Ed Wilsons dogged effort to free himself for taking the fall for the CIAs covert arming and training of Libyans and others.  On October 27, 2003 Judge Lynn Hughs declared that Wilson was working for the CIA, and that the CIA had lied to the Court under oath.  The CIA lie had kept one of their own in prison for 22 years.  The Wilson Decision made Shackleys catch phrase,  plausible deniability? no longer plausible and no longer deniable.<br />
<br />
      Evidence shows Cannistraro and Revell had postings in the U.S. Embassy, Rome, on the posh Via Veneto. Wilsons operation to supply and train Libyan hit squads ran out of the CIAs Rome station.   The Rome Station also ran a covert operation to ship military supplies to Iraq in the early 80s.  KINEX was a CIA propriety listed as Kabbara International Exports, owned by two Lebanese brothers, Zouher and Nadim Kabbara.  In actual fact it was cover for TD-WAVE.  The telephone number for KINEX, [ 8o.49.80] rang inside the U.S. Embassy who paid the bill.19<br />
<br />
      Plaintiffs were not the only former U.S. Intelligence Operatives to become targets of TD-WAVE.   Arms dealer, Sarkis Soghanalian, a CIA agent-in-place in Iraq was playing Saddam Hussein like a fiddle.   Suddenly Sarkis was indicted in Shackleys old Miami back-yard on a single weapons charge, for illegally owning one RPG.20 Sarkis knew the truth, and shall now so testify.<br />
<br />
      Defendant, FBI Agent, David Edward was a pawn in the TD-WAVE plot, on the short leash of Oliver Buck Revell.  Edward was the street agent who went after Plaintiff Coleman and Pan Am investigator, Juval Aviv to shut down their claims linking the CIA to the Pan Am bombing.  Aviv had to spend his savings to defend Federal trumped-up mail fraud charges.  A jury  acquitted him in the Southern District of New York in 1996.<br />
<br />
      TD-WAVE/ FBI  fabrications  included a 1992 attempt to deport Coleman from his sanctuary in Sweden.21   Swedish Secret Police, SAPO determined the deportation request was  rancid  with  FBI lies.  The Coleman family remained  guests of the Swedish government.<br />
<br />
      Defendant, FBI Agent, Thomas Thurman was another TD-WAVE pawn.  Thurman was a FBI forensic Agent at the National Crime Lab.  He was the principle forensic expert in the Pan Am 103 investigation.  Thurman claimed to have  identified the micro-chip fragment from a timer used to set off the Pan Am bomb.  It was yet another dissembling to cover the CIAs tracks and the truth that the micro-chip came from a batch Meister & Bollier (MEBO) Zurich, sold to Wilsons CIA operation, when he was arming, and training Libyans, and others in the art of blowing up airliners.  Thurman was fired by Crime Lab Supervisor, Dr. Fredrick Whitehurst for embellishing evidence to favor prosecutors, causing a national scandal.<br />
<br />
       Dr. Fredrick Whitehurst was soon forced out by FBI Director, Louis Freeh for blowing the whistle on the Crime Labs history of embellishments.  Interestingly, Dr. Whitehurst was assisting Plaintiff Coleman in an investigation of  Lexington, KY Police when the TD-WAVE Tsunami hit, tossing Coleman back in jail.<br />
<br />
      The over-whelming evidence, presented herein, is, in itself, just cause for Plaintiffs claims under 42 USC 1983 and 18 USC 1962,1964(c).  The very fact that the investigation of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 was headed by Vincent Cannistraro and Oliver Revell, was like having two sly foxes guarding the chicken-coop.  The very U.S. government officials charged with uncovering truth, were bent on hiding it.  The truth would have never been told without the determination of  Edwin Wilson, his attorney, David Adler, and the courageous decision by the Honorable Lynn Hughes, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas. <br />
<br />
<br />
      THEREFORE: Plaintiffs so move, pursuant to Civil Rule 15 (a), that the original complaint be amended herewith, THIS, THE  28th DAY OF  APRIL, 2005.</p>

		<p>From the picture, DeeDee doesn't look a day older than when a bunch of us college students, home for Christmas break, gathered at her parents home to sing Christmas Carols after Midnight Mass back in the early 70's.  <br />
<br />
I would like to see DeeDee, Katie, and Megan collaborate on a book and call it something like Milk River Ridge.</p>

		<p>It’s a shame he couldn’t get enough information for a real account of what happened, of course the FBI would want to keep a tight lid of issues of &lt;a &gt;drug abuse&lt;/a&gt; and drug dealing within their organization. Their lack of honesty to the public is one of the main things that worries me about these government agencies. I look forward to getting the novel next time I’m at my book shop.</p>

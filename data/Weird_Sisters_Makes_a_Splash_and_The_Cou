							<p><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399157226" title="The Weird Sisters">The Weird Sisters</a></I> (Amy Einhorn Books, 318 pp., $24.95), the debut novel by Denver-based writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eleanor-brown.com/the-weird-sisters" title="Eleanor Brown">Eleanor Brown</a>, is earning lots of national praise. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-01-20-buzzplus20_ST_N.htm" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> featured it in a recent &#8220;New Voices&#8221; column, describing the plot in this way: &#8220;Three seemingly incompatible sisters, whose father is a Shakespeare scholar, return home to help their mother deal with breast cancer.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Barnes &amp; Noble picked it for their Discover Great New Writers Program, Amazon.com featured it in their &#8220;Best of the Month&#8221; list, Cathy Langer, head buyer for Denver&#8217;s Tattered Cover, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-01-06-winterpreview06_ST_N.htm" title="talked it up">talked it up</a>, Entertainment Weekly and People Magazine praised it, and Janet Maslin wrote for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/books/17book.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, &#8220;Eleanor Brown&#8217;s debut novel begins charmingly, narrated by three sisters who speak as a single entity.&#8221;  And <I>The Weird Sisters</I> has just been out for a week.

She&#8217;s going to keep it the same and make it better.

&#8226; I reviewed Annie Proulx&#8217;s <I>Bird Cloud</I> for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/books/20110121-book-review-bird-cloud_by-annie-proulx.ece" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a>. I enjoyed the insights the memoir offered into her fiction writing mind.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s one thing I learned:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although Proulx&#8217;s sympathies in her fiction usually lie with Wyoming natives like the James gang, we learn that Proulx, in her quest for the perfect Japanese soak tub, solar panels and Brazilian floor tiles, might be more like the outsiders she poked fun at in her story &#8216;Man Crawling Out of Trees,&#8217; in which a New York couple buys a home in Wyoming, one of the many pine-log &#8216;estates&#8217; that resulted when ranch widows &#8216;dumped the cows and called up the real estate brokers, who sketched out thirty-five-acre ranchettes.&#8217; They proceed to lavishly outfit their new home, as does Proulx.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Proulx isn&#8217;t doing an extensive book tour, but she will discuss <I>Bird Cloud</I> at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tickets.dallasmuseumofart.org/public/" title="Dallas Museum of Art">Dallas Museum of Art</a> on January 28 at 7:30 p.m.
</p>
<p>
Annie Proulx will appear 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Dallas Museum of Art, as part of Arts &amp; Letters Live. Tickets $37, with discounts for seniors and students at

							Boulder has always been home to an unusually large number of newspapers and magazines given its modest size, perhaps due to its highly-educated citizenry and excess of writersâ€”you can hardly enter a coffee shop in town without tripping over an aspiring or employed scribbler. But as anyone in the newspapering game can tell you, declines in readership and advertising revenues have made it extremely difficult for independent publications to stay afloat financially. This week there was another casualty: media conglomerate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripps.com/" title="Scripps">Scripps</a>, the owner of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com" title="Daily Camera">Daily Camera</a>, announced that it has also acquired the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradodaily.com" title="Colorado Daily">Colorado Daily</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/local_business/article/0,1713,BDC_2461_4111554,00.html" title="as reported by <i>Camera</i> staff">as reported by <i>Camera</i> staff</a> on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
The Cincinnati-based Scripps seems to have a healthy appetite for local publicationsâ€”it also owns the <i>Broomfield Enterprise</i> and the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, and it purchased the <i>Daily Camera</i> from Knight Ridder Inc. in 1997. Although it isnâ€™t clear from the website, it would appear that Scripps also owns <i>Dirt</i>, the annoyingly pseudo-hip free daily entertainment newspaper that the <i>Daily Camera</i> spun off to try to capture advertising dollars from businesses targeting younger readers than its main publication typically attracts. <br />
<br />
Until its purchase, the <i>Colorado Daily</i> was one of the few remaining independent papers in the area.  According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradodaily.com/about" title="its website">its website</a>, publication of the <i>Silver & Gold</i>, which became the <i> Daily</i>, began in 1892. In 1972, the paper moved off CU campus and became independent from the university. The paper had suffered financial problems in the recent past, but until this week it appeared to have stabilized under the ownership of Randy Miller and his company New Colorado Daily, Inc. <br />
<br />
Miller bought the then-bankrupt paper in 2001, and according to the <i>Camera</i> article, Miller â€œwill continue to serve as president, publisher and editor of the <i>Colorado Daily</i>.  Miller told <a target="_blank" href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001181688" title="Editor & Publisher">Editor & Publisher</a> that â€œWeâ€™re still going to be a politically independent paperâ€? and â€œweâ€™re still going to be the paper for Boulderâ€™s young adults and serve that readership with our reporting and advertising.â€?  But will Scripps really keep both the <i>Colorado Daily</i> and <i>Dirt</i> alive since they target the same market and compete for the same advertising dollars?  Odds are that if one of the two are eliminated, itâ€™ll be <i>Dirt</i>, which doesnâ€™t boast the extensive tradition of the <i>Daily</i>.<br />
<br />
This buyout will have the owners of the remaining alternative entertainment publications in town, <i>Boulder Weekly</i> and <i>The Onion</i>, eager to determine how to exploit the change to their advantage. Full disclosure: like many freelance journalists, Iâ€™ve written for a slew of publications over the yearsâ€”I used to write for <i>Westword</i> and the <i>Colorado Daily</i>, and for over five years Iâ€™ve been writing for the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> and <i>The Onion</i>, another paper that used to be locally owned but was recently acquired by the national <i>Onion</i>.  In the interest of keeping my job, I wonâ€™t be writing about that transition here, but the <i>Denver Post</i> is planning to run article on it in its business section this week.<br />
<br />

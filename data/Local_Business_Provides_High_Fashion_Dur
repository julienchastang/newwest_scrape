							Sometimes thereâ€™s a lot of money to be made in solving a problem nobody knew they had.  <a href="http://www.birthinbinsi.com/Index.htm" title="Binsi">Binsi</a>, a Berthoud, Colorado company has been garnering a lot of attention lately for its line of birthing clothing.  Thatâ€™s right, moms, you canâ€™t get away with sloppy dressing when youâ€™re in labor anymoreâ€”not when <a href="http://www.birthinbinsi.com/Celebrity.htm" title="Jennifer Garner, Katie Homes, and Brooke Shields">Jennifer Garner, Katie Homes, and Brooke Shields</a> are donning Binsiâ€™s fashion-forward labor costumes.  According to a recent article in the <a href="http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4285069,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>, Carri Grimditch started the company during her second pregnancy because she wanted to avoid wearing an â€œundignified hospital gownâ€? during labor.  Sure, nobody would choose to wear gaping hospital gowns on a daily basis, but I usually find that Iâ€™m not dwelling on my clothing during my time at the doctorâ€™s officeâ€”instead I prefer to stare at the ceiling tiles and pretend that nothing is happening.  Strange as it may seem, perhaps with the prevalence of painkilling epidurals, mothers in the middle of labor are finding their minds wandering to matters of fashion.<br />
<br />
Binsi offers three different knee-length skirts that range in price from $40-$52, a sports-bra-like â€œGo Go Topâ€? ($38), and a tank top ($43).  As reporter Ashley Acton explained in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, â€œFlaps, buttons, snap and ties are located in just the right places for easy medical access, while keeping you covered up and, as Grimditch said, â€˜looking cute.â€™â€?  I had thought that one of the advantages of labor is that the mother has the right not to â€œlook cuteâ€? during it, that she has the right to look perfectly frightful if she wants and still expect the love and affection of her family, but apparently this rule no longer holds.<br />
<br />
Whenever I hear about the latest trend in giving birth, I think of what labor must have been like for my ancestors, pioneers who came to Nebraska from Bohemia in the 1800â€™s, and gave birth in their isolated farm homes with no doctors or midwives available, and no indoor toilets until the 1960â€™s.  Whatâ€™s more, they gave birth prodigiously under these conditions, with most women in my family having eight to twelve children apiece.  I can imagine what my great-great-great grandmother would say if I were able to ask her what she would think of me buying a special outfit so that I could â€œlook cuteâ€? during labor.  Sheâ€™d look up at me, a half-dozen children swarming around her feet as wrung a chickenâ€™s neck and say, â€œYouâ€™ve been in Boulder too long, honey.â€?<br />

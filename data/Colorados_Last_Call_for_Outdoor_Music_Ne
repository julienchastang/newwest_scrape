							If the band playing on a free outdoor stage is Kansas, looking like a crew of portly, over-the-hill pirates, it must be state fair season.<br />
Coloradoâ€™s generally fine September weather offers music fans one last chance to catch some outdoor concerts before they must scurry indoors for their entertainment, and there will be plenty of shows under the open sky next weekend for the Labor Day holiday.<br />
<br />
In Pueblo, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradostatefair.com" title="Colorado State Fair">Colorado State Fair</a> is already underway (August 24-September 5), offering performances by such where-are-they-now? fodder as Collective Soul, Alice Cooper, and Eddie Money.<br />
<br />
In Denver, the ever-popular <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atasteofcolorado.com/" title="A Taste Of Colorado">A Taste Of Colorado</a> will attract hungry throngs to the Civic Center, where over fifty restaurants will hawk their food, and entertainers will fill seven oddly-named stages. (Forgive me if I fail to stop by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atasteofcolorado.com/music.php#Wholesome%20Milk%20Products%20Heritage%20Stage" title="Jammin' 92.5's Wholesome Milk Products Heritage Stage">Jammin' 92.5's Wholesome Milk Products Heritage Stage</a>. And just what exactly is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atasteofcolorado.com/music.php#Coors%20Hispanic%20Stage" title="Coors Hispanic">Coors Hispanic</a>?) Like any self-respecting fair, the Main Stage will feature several once-massive acts whose moment of cultural relevance has passed, including Joan Osborne (Friday), Foghat (Saturday), Craig Chaquico (Sunday), and Kansas (Monday)â€”but hey, the shows are free, so count on a hordes waving their turkey drumsticks to â€œSlow Ride.â€?<br />
<br />
Aspenâ€™s annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jazzaspen.com" title="Jazz Aspen">Jazz Aspen</a> Snowmass Labor Day Festival takes a jammy turn this year when Widespread Panic headlines the first two nights (September 1-2).  Then, itâ€™s bring out the graybeards, with the Loggins & Messina reunion (September 3) and John Fogerty and Willie Nelson (September 4). A reggae night with Maxi Priest and Alpha Blondy (September 5) would seem to suggest a jarring stylistic shift for the four-day festival, but wait: Willie Nelson provides a nice segue with his just-released reggae disc, <i>Countryman</i>. (And yes, thatâ€™s a marijuana leaf on the albumâ€™s cover.)  In addition to the main stage attractions, jam bands such as Galactic, Aphrodesia, Shanti Groove, Karl Denson's Tiny Universe and The Motet will play ten oâ€™clock shows around Aspen at The Blue Door, the Snowmass Conference Center, and Mountain Dragon.<br />
<br />
Thereâ€™s still time to catch one last show at Red Rocks, and there are plenty of good ones to choose from, including Tori Amos (September 5), The Allman Brothers and Lucinda Williams (September 18), Oasis (September 20), and Santana and Robert Randolph (September 27-28).<br />
<br />
The final Colorado outdoor festivals of the season will be the <a target="_blank" href="http://southparkmusic.com/index2.htm" title="South Park Music Festival">South Park Music Festival</a>, which will offer a three-day showcase of dozens of independent bands (September 8-10), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tellurideblues.com/" title="Telluride Blues & Brews Festival">Telluride Blues & Brews Festival</a>, at which the beer and music will flow freely. Highlights include headliners Al Green, The Black Crowes, and Susan Tedeschi (September 16-18).

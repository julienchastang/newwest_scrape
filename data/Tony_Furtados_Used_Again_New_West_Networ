							The<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldertheater.com" title=" Boulder Theater"> Boulder Theater</a> offers a compelling reason to leave the house and overcome the post-turkey frowziness Friday, with a show by Colorado favorites <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drewemmitt.com/mainpage.asp" title="Drew Emmitt ">Drew Emmitt </a>and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tonyfurtado.com/" title="Tony Furtado">Tony Furtado</a>.  Singer/mandolin player Emmitt is best known for his time with Leftover Salmon, a group that is currently on hiatus.  He'll front his own band Friday, as will Tony Furtado, the slide guitarist and banjo player.  The 21+ show starts at 8:30 p.m. and tickets are $17.<br />
<br />
Furtado is gearing up to release a new album, <i>Thirteen</i>, and he's offered a track for New West readers.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/MP3s/tonyusedagain.mp3" title="Click here to listen to "Used Again."">Click here to listen to "Used Again."</a>

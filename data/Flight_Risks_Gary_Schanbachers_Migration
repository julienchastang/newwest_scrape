	The characters in Colorado writer Gary Schanbacher&#8217;s engrossing debut story collection tend to flee when the going gets rough.&nbsp; An itinerant laborer and ex-con named Nash who leads a crew that does shoddy repairs in the wake of coastal storms figures in three stories, and he&#8217;s in motion practically the whole time, driving around looking for work or returning home to Denver to try to make sense of his past.&nbsp; Even Nash&#8217;s father Alvin, who is elderly and has diminished faculties, gets around quite a bit, breaking out of any nursing home or hospital he&#8217;s placed in and still managing to find his way home.&nbsp; The Colorado landscape plays a prominent role in many of the stories, its mountains serving as beacons for characters who have lost their way.
</p>
<p>
	This is especially true for Clayton, the protagonist of the fine novella &#8220;The Sea in These Hills.&#8221;  The story begins in 1955 in Virginia (where Schanbacher grew up before moving to Colorado many years ago), when Clayton is a young man spending the summer catching crabs to sell to a local fish market.&nbsp;  He falls in love with Loretta, the teenage bride of the crusty, abusive proprietor of the market.&nbsp; They carry on their affair for several years.&nbsp; The love triangle is eventually forced to its crisis in a tense scene that displays Schanbacher&#8217;s skill for dramatizing his characters&#8217; underlying psychological motivations, and Clayton flees across the country to Colorado, where he ends up in a mountain mining town that is destined to be flooded by a dam in a few years. 
</p>
<p>
	Schanbacher writes beautifully, but not in a showy way.&nbsp; He builds up characters and landscape through simple, precise detail, such as when he describes Clayton catching a glimpse of Loretta on a hot Virginia day, &#8220;a small rotating fan stirring her hair.&#8221;  There are hardly any slip-ups in this tight, compelling novella (such as when a telephone conversation is cut off just as Clayton is to learn a key detail about Loretta, and his friend seems to have never bothered to finish his thought in four years of subsequent telephone conversations).&nbsp;  
<br />
The setting of the Colorado portion of the novella is fascinating: a town in its final years before it is flooded to make way for progress, the graves of its founders dug up and moved.&nbsp; Some of the townspeople protest and put up a fight against developers, while others accept their buyouts and do their best to make new lives elsewhere.&nbsp; Clayton, still crushed by his disappointment with Loretta, stays in the town as long as possible, leaving after it is totally deserted. &#8220;One evening at dusk,&#8221; Schanbacher writes, &#8220;a coyote stalked down the center of Main Street, as if reclaiming it.&#8221;  Although there is only one story of this length in <I>Migration Patterns</I>, Schanbacher works so well in this longer form that I won&#8217;t be surprised if he turns out a novel soon.
</p>
<p>
The next cycle of three semi-connected short stories begins with &#8220;Herding Instinct,&#8221; about a teenager named Jeffrey Pugh who draws solo summer sheepherding duty when his older brother grows tired of their father&#8217;s demands and refuses to help.&nbsp; Despite the distant attractions of town, his awakening interest in girls, and his resentment toward his father, Jeffrey does a conscientious job taking care of the sheep in summer pasture, until a calamitous betrayal prompts him to flee across the country, &#8220;to wherever the truckers might carry him,&#8221; as is the template of <I>Migration Patterns</I>.&nbsp; Jeffrey next fetches up in Boulder, Colorado, as a wild-eyed survivalist in the background of the story &#8220;Laws of Gravity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Laws of Gravity&#8221; is a great Boulder story, featuring a house just like those that many students passing through here have lived in, full of weird, naked roommates named Windship, complicated sleeping arrangements, and tumultuous love affairs.&nbsp; The narrator is a law student who falls in love with a very Boulder woman named Shelly, who is &#8220;forever off on one excursion or another: rock climbing in Eldorado Canyon, kayaking the white water of the Cache La Poudre, hiking the remote wilderness of Flattop Mountain.&#8221;  The narrator even manages to marry Shelly despite knowing that he can&#8217;t keep her tied down for long&#8212;and there&#8217;s only one way for this story to end, with the flight of one of the characters.
</p>
<p>
While the humor in &#8220;Laws of Gravity&#8221; is sharp and incisive, the next story, &#8220;Windship Universe Floats to Earth,&#8221; gets a little goofy, featuring an altercation at the grocery checkout line involving a cantaloupe and levitation.&nbsp; Still, it shows Schanbacher isn&#8217;t afraid to include some playful moments in his fiction and that bodes well for his career.&nbsp; <I>Migration Patterns</I> is the welcome and promising debut of a Colorado fiction writer with a keen sense for psychological detail and an appreciation for the influence natural landscapes can have on people&#8217;s behavior.

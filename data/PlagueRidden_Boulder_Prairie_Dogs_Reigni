							Itâ€™s a controversy as old as the settled West, pitting developers, ranchers, and property owners against environmentalists and preservationists.  No, the subject of this rancor isnâ€™t water rights or urban sprawlâ€”itâ€™s prairie dogs.  And whenever a prairie dog colony tests <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/county_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2423_3979760,00.html" title="positive for plague">positive for plague</a>, as fleas from a north Boulder colony did last week, the anti-prairie dog coalition scores a victory in the ongoing battle.<br />
<br />
As a lifelong westerner who has never owned a golf course or run a ranch, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed prairie dogs.  I admired the way they seemed to, ahem, doggedly reestablish the hole-ridden, dusty Old West wherever it suited them, as they did in a small southeast Denver field down the street from where I grew up, creating a rodent island paradise surrounded by busy urban streets.  I am no less charmed by their mannerisms than Lewis and Clark were when they first encountered the critters.  They packed up a live one to send to Thomas Jefferson, along with several other animals, but itâ€™s a testimony to the prairie dogâ€™s hardiness that it was one of the few that survived the journey.  <br />
<br />
Prairie dogs are found in much of the open space in Boulder, and I love watching them waddle around, burdened by their fat stomachs, greeting each other with a kiss, and sounding alerts with a yip.  In the spring I watch the tiny baby doggers take their first tentative steps outside of the burrow.  Often when they sound their alerts, the dogs will rear up on both legs and raise their arms in they air, so that it feels almost like theyâ€™re worshipping you as a passing dignitary while you run by.  Or maybe thatâ€™s just those pesky delusions of grandeur flaring up again.<br />
<br />
I am not alone in harboring a soft spot for prairie dogsâ€”the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/planning/PrairieDogs/" title="City of Boulder">City of Boulder</a> has done everything to show its affection for the animals but have city council members go around giving them annual wet kisses on the mouth.  In 2000, they passed the sort of ordinance that makes Coloradoans outside of Boulder roll their eyesâ€”a law that prohibited the poisoning of prairie dogs, followed by one that forbade the destruction of their burrows. A revised ordinance, passed in January this year, allows the killing of prairie dogs provided â€œa reasonable effort has been made to relocate the prairie dogs to another site,â€? and â€œthe most humane method of lethal control possible will be used.â€?<br />
<br />
Plenty of people get bent out of shape about the fuss thatâ€™s made to relocate prairie dogs, and plenty of people derive joy from killing them.  There was even a group calling itself the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westword.com/issues/1999-03-25/feature.html" title="Varmint Militia">Varmint Militia</a> for a while, staging prairie dog shooting events.  This group was featured prominently in the feature-length 1998 documentary on the controversy, <a target="_blank" href="http://highplainsfilms.org/fp_varmint.html" title="Varmints">Varmints</a>.  <br />
<br />
One device offered on the internet for prairie dog eradication is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rodenator.com/" title="The Rodenator Pro">The Rodenator Pro</a>, which boasts a heavy-metal-band-esque logo and the catchy slogan â€œThe boss of the burrow.â€?  This device uses â€œa controlled mixture of propane and oxygen that is injected into the rodent's burrow. A built-in, self contained ignition system then ignites the mixture, creating an underground shockwave or concussion that instantly eliminates the rodent and collapses the tunnel system.â€?  Hmmm, that soundsâ€¦safe.  I wonder what method The Rodenator Amateur employs. The device is banned in Colorado, but the website includes a study from the Montana Department of Agriculture that details how The Rodenator Pro was used to great effect in a study in that state.  Luckily for the prairie dogs, they have defenders who are equally as passionate, such as the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prairiedogs.org/news.html" title="Rocky Mountain Animal Defense">Rocky Mountain Animal Defense</a> who file lawsuits on their behalf and keep track of developments on their website.<br />
<br />
As for the plague-ridden north Boulder colony, government officials have posted warnings in the Wonderland Hills trail area, and have cautioned people to keep their dogs on leashes and wear insect repellant to avoid being bit by plague-carrying fleas that can transmit the disease from prairie dogs to humans. Iâ€™m glad they havenâ€™t encouraged citizens to eliminate diseased animals, or things could get very <i>Caddy Shack</i> around here.<br />

		<p>Read your article with interest. We have a prairie dog town that has been doubling in size every 18 months. It now consumes about 60 acres. The grass in that part of our pasture is 0-1/4" long. Normally it is 12-24" long. Experts at the Dept. of Agriculture recommend immediate control. I certainly feel as connected to the land and its animals as anyone and am seeking alternatives to poison or explosives. Hopefully you can help. Please don't refer me to more articles and studies as I've read dozens. Do you know of a relocation solution or an experimental method? Perhaps you can forward this to contacts used in your research. We are located between Big Timber and Harlowtown in MT. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

		<p>Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in prairie dog control, but I bet that if you contacted the people at City of Boulder who are in charge of praire dog control, they could give you some advice, because they have a lot of experience with landowners who have a similar problem, and have used relocation extensively.  The contact info is at this page:<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ci.boulder.co.us%2Fplanning%2FPrairieDogs%2Fcontact_info.htm">http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/planning/PrairieDogs/contact_info.htm</a><br />
<br />
Most of the other organizations that I looked into for this article seem to either be on the side of shooting or poisoning prairie dogs or not allowing them to be harmed under any circumstances, but Boulder city government has had to balance the two factions.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  I hope they don't eat you out of house & home.</p>

		<p>Thanks for your advice. I talked with Bev at City of Boulder. She said re-location has worked but is very expensive and itâ€™s extremely difficult to find areas that will accept prairie dogs. Also itâ€™s usually done only on small acreages. <br />
<br />
According to Bev there have been experiments with plastic weed barriers like those found along highway construction areas, but results proved unsuccessful. Various types of fencing have been tried, also proving ineffective. They are playing around with a mesh material, which is laid over the ground to prevent further dog holes from popping up.  <br />
<br />
Bev referred me to Wild Places, a non-profit specializing in prairie dogs. Iâ€™ve left 2 messages without response. <br />
<br />
Bev also recommended Roe Ecological services, a for profit contractor. Kelly was very helpful and accommodating. She gave me a rough estimate of $600/ acre (about $36,000 in our case) to live trap 90-95% of our prairie dogs. They would then be euthanised and used as captive raptor food. Or the dogs could be relocated at an additional cost, if a site could be found. <br />
<br />
Kelly also mentioned Dog-Gone, the guys with the giant vacuum that sucks prairie dogs from their holes. She estimated their price to do our 60 acres at $250,000! <br />
<br />
Both these options are way beyond our budget. We are looking for organizations that may cost share or subsidize a relocation project. I have left messages with The Nature Conservancy and the Ferret Program. <br />
<br />
Apparently they sell for $300 in Japan as pets. Iâ€™ll give them free to any willing entrepreneur. At 10 dogs/acre x 60 acresâ€¦.thatâ€™s $180,000! Where else can you get a return like that?<br />
<br />
Let me know if you or your readers have any other thoughts on how to control these pesky persistent little buggers without killinâ€™ â€˜em or going broke. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

		<p>We have moved into a brand new facility and have prarire dogs accross the road. I wonder is there a proven method to keep the dogs from coming over to our new lawn. We do not need to remove but deter.</p>

							As reported recently by Patti Thorn in the Rocky Mountain News (<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_4335397,00.html" title=""Castle Rock poet a natural fit for prestigious prize"">"Castle Rock poet a natural fit for prestigious prize"</a>), Castle Rock poet Pattiann Rogers recently won the Lannan Literary Award, a prize of $125,000, which is about $125,000 more than most poets can expect to earn from their toils.  This award honors Rogers' career achievement, but she's no stranger to national recognition: According to <a href="http://www.lannan.org/lf/bios/detail/pattiann-rogers/" title="her bio">her bio</a> on the Lannan Foundation website, she's previously racked up "two National Endowment for the Arts grants, a Guggenheim Award, the Tietjens Prize and the Hokin Prize from Poetry magazine, and four Pushcart Prizes."  Her poetry trophy shelf must be groaning under the weight of all that booty.<br />
<br />
The 65-year-old Rogers is the mother of two grown children and her husband is a geophysicist.  She told Thorn that she "began writing poetry in college...more casually than with any serious plans.  Then, after the births of her two sons, 'I thought that I owed it to my sons to work more diligently, if I had any talent in the field at all...If I was going to ask them to develop their own talent, then I had to do that, too...I made a commitment to work daily, to try to get help from people who could guide me...At some point, then the coaching is over and you're on your own.'"<br />
<br />
Rogers specializes in poems about the natural world, such as those found in her new collection, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1571314210/qid=1135708972/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/102-4889290-2522511?s=books&v=glance&n=283155" title="Firekeeper: Selected Poems, Revised and Expanded">Firekeeper: Selected Poems, Revised and Expanded</a> (Milkweed, 2005).  In 2003, Rogers took her poetry's nature connection to the next level, participating in a project called "River Bench," which according to <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~pattiann_rogers/" title="her website">her website</a> is "set along the Ute trail portion of the 'America the Beautiful' Trail as it follows a small creek near Green Mountain Falls, CO. The bench incorporates nine poems written by Pattiann especially for this project."<br />
<br />
Several of Rogers' poems are <a href="http://www.milkweed.org/3_3_7a.html" title="featured here">featured here</a>.

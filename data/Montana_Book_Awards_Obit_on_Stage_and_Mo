							<p>It might not be spring yet, but it sure feels like it here in Colorado, where our piles of November snow have finally started to melt and some crocuses are peeking out of the ground.&nbsp; With the change in season comes a bunch of regional book awards and event announcements:
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://storiesonstage.org/" title="Stories on Stage">Stories on Stage</a>, a Denver theater company that presents literature through performances by professional actors, will present <I>The Stories of Your Life</I> based on the work of <a target="_blank" href="http://web.mac.com/jsheeler/jimsheeler.com/jim_sheeler.html" title="Jim Sheeler">Jim Sheeler</a> on March 13 (5 &amp; 8 p.m., Jones Theater, DCPA). Sheeler, a former reporter for the Rocky Mountain News who won a Pulitzer Prize for his series <I>Final Salute</I> (later published as a book of the same name), honed his skills as a journalist by writing obituaries.&nbsp; He collected his favorites in the book <I>Obit: Inspiring Stories of Ordinary People who Led Extraordinary Lives</I>, which <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/jim_sheelers_obit_brings_to_life_dead_westerners/C39/L39/" title="Peggy Lowe reviewed for New West">Peggy Lowe reviewed for New West</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <I>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</I> by Great Falls resident <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamieford.com" title="Jamie Ford">Jamie Ford</a> is the winner of the 2009 Montana Book Award.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6654853.html?q=hotel+on+the+corner+of+bitter+and+sweet" title="School Library Journal">School Library Journal</a> described the plot of the book in this way:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
 &#8220;Henry Lee is a 12-year-old Chinese boy who falls in love with Keiko Okabe, a 12-year-old Japanese girl, while they are scholarship students at a prestigious private school in World War II Seattle. Henry hides the relationship from his parents, who would disown him if they knew he had a Japanese friend. His father insists that Henry wear an &#8216;I am Chinese&#8217; button everywhere he goes because Japanese residents of Seattle have begun to be shipped off by the thousands to relocation centers. This is an old-fashioned historical novel that alternates between the early 1940s and 1984, after Henry&#8217;s wife Ethel has died of cancer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
The Montana Book Award is only the latest in a series that <I>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</I> has won.&nbsp; As Ford notes on his website, the novel has also been an &#8220;IndieBound NEXT List Selection, a Borders Original Voices Selection, a Barnes &amp; Noble Book Club Selection, Pennie&#8217;s Pick at Costco, a Target Bookmarked Club Pick, and a National Bestseller. It was also named the #1 Book Club Pick for Fall 2009/Winter 2010 by the American Booksellers Association.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Montana Book Award Committee also chose four honor books: <I>The 600 Hours of Edward</I> by Craig Lancaster (Riverbend Publishing), <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/young_men_and_fire_timothy_egans_the_big_burn/C39/L39/" title="The Big Burn">The Big Burn</a></I> by Timothy Egan (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), <I>The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet</I> by Reif Larsen (Penguin) and <I>Stick Horses and Other Stories of Ranch Life</I> by Wallace MacRae (Gibbs Smith).&nbsp; The award reception will be held on April 8 during the Montana Library Association Conference in Bozeman. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s heartening to see the mix of books by small and large publishers together on that list, and the honor adds another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/riverbend_gives_self_published_novel_a_second_chance/C39/L39/" title="interesting chapter to the journey of Craig Lancaster's novel">interesting chapter to the journey of Craig Lancaster&#8217;s novel</a>, which he originally self-published.&nbsp; On the other end of the publishing spectrum, Reif Larsen <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.observer.com/2008/million-dollar-baby " title="reportedly received nearly a million-dollar advance">reportedly received nearly a million-dollar advance</a> for his <I>The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet</I>.&nbsp; (Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/a_few_thoughts_on_reif_larsens_novel_the_selected_works_of_t_s_spivet/C39/L39/" title="Allen M. Jones' essay about the book">Allen M. Jones&#8217; essay about the book</a>, which points out a few discrepancies in its details, such as its depiction of fireflies in Montana.)
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Speaking of books that have been featured at Costco, the book buyer there has selected <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arynkyle.com/Welcome.html" title="Aryn Kyle">Aryn Kyle</a>&#8216;s <I>The God of Animals</I> for her Pennie&#8217;s Pick for March.&nbsp; This selection by Costco is one of the last major windfalls left for an author in what is soon to be a post-Oprah Winfrey Show landscape.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
As Denver literary agent Kristin Nelson, who represents Jaime Ford, recently told me, a book club selection by Costco or Target, or a featured slot in grocery stores virtually guarantees a book will sell a lot of copies.
</p>
<p>
This couldn&#8217;t come at a better time for Kyle, who grew up in Grand Junction, Colo. and lived for several years in Missoula.&nbsp; Her first story collection, <I>Boys and Girls Like You and Me</I>, will be out next month, and the Costco selection for her novel should win her some new fans.&nbsp; Kyle&#8217;s story <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fivechapters.com/2010/take-care-part-one/" title=""Take Care"">&#8220;Take Care&#8221;</a> is up on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fivechapters.com/" title="Five Chapters">Five Chapters</a> this week. (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://fictionwritersreview.com" title="Fiction Writers Review">Fiction Writers Review</a>.)
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Everyone with spring fever should certainly head to Tucson for the second annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tucsonfestivalofbooks.org" title="Tucson Festival of Books">Tucson Festival of Books</a>, held March 13 and 14 on the University of Arizona campus.&nbsp; The folks who planned it seemed to have gotten it right on their very first try, drawing over 50,000 people to last year&#8217;s events.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tucsonfestivalofbooks.org/author/list#L" title="Dozens of authors will be there">Dozens of authors will be there</a>, including Elmore Leonard, Timothy Egan, Jamie Ford, and one of my favorites, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_ron_carlson_about_the_signal/C39/L39/" title="Ron Carlson">Ron Carlson</a>.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Denver&#8217;s Dave Cullen won the 2009 Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers award in nonfiction for his book <I>Columbine</I>.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Literary Arts, the people behind <a target="_blank" href="http://www.literary-arts.org/awards/" title="The Oregon Book Awards">The Oregon Book Awards</a>, are currently accepting applications for the 2011 prizes. Books published between April 1, 2009 and July 31, 2010 by Oregon authors are eligible.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; On March 14, Janet Kay, who divides her time between Montana and Wisconsin, will read from her debut novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.watersofthedancingsky.com/signings.htm" title="Waters of the Dancing Sky">Waters of the Dancing Sky</a></I>, at The Grizzly Claw in Seeley Lake (4 p.m.).

		<b>Comment By Lynn, 3-10-10</b>
		<p>I loved the book Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet and I had no idea it was written by a Great Falls person.  You are such a great advocate for Rocky Mountain writers - much appreciated and great unparalled coverage.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Christopher, 3-11-10</b>
		<p>I just finished reading 600 Hours of Edward, a runner-up for the Montana Book Award, and absolutely loved it! It has been a while since I have been so captivated with a lead character as I was in this novel with Edward. I have thanked the person that recommended this book to me and look forward to sharing it with a friend or two of my own. Also, thank you to Jenny Shank and NewWest for your reporting on western literature.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Dave Cullen, 3-11-10</b>
		<p>Thanks for the shout-out on my book, &lt;a &gt;Columbine&lt;/a&gt;. I would love a Costco or Target slot. I'm still praying for that, but the B&N;award was very cool. They flew me in, and I got to meet the other five authors, and lots of book people. Very nice event. And then I got to take home the Tiffany crystal, too.<br />
<br />
BTW, an expanded paperback edition is just out this week. <br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time on the new material, so I hope it's OK to mention what we added:<br />
<br />
— A 12-page afterword: “Forgiveness,” with startling new revelations on the killers' parents.<br />
<br />
— Actual journal pages from Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold.<br />
<br />
— Book Club Discussion Questions (also available at Oprah.com).<br />
<br />
— Diagram of Columbine High School and environs.<br />
<br />
— A large-print edition is also now available.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</p>

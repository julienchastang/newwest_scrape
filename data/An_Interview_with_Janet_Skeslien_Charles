		<h1>An Interview with Janet Skeslien Charles</h1>
		<h2><i>A Shelby native writer discusses her first novel, "Moonlight in Odessa."</i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 9-21-09</p>
			
			
							<p><I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jskesliencharles.com" title="Janet Skeslien Charles">Janet Skeslien Charles</a> grew up in Shelby, Montana and studied English, French, and Russian at the University of Montana, where she had a part time job translating letters from Montana men to their prospective Russian brides.&nbsp; After graduation, she moved to Odessa, Ukraine as a Soros Fellow, where she taught English for two years and began to research the mail-order bride industry, which became the topic of her winning debut novel, </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Moonlight-Odessa-Janet-Skeslien-Charles/dp/1596916729/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253391405&amp;sr=8-1" title="Moonlight in Odessa">Moonlight in Odessa</a><I>.&nbsp; The book follows Daria, a smart, ambitious Odessan woman whose English language skills earn her a coveted office job.&nbsp; She moonlights as a translator for a matchmaking service, and then attempts to make an international love match of her own.&nbsp; Since 1999, Skeslien Charles has worked and lived in Paris, where she has taught writing classes at Shakespeare &amp; Company.&nbsp; She will discuss and sign </I>Moonlight in Odessa<I> at Hastings in Great Falls on Sunday, September 20 (2-4 p.m.) and on the University of Montana campus in Missoula on Wednesday, September 23 from 12-1:30 p.m. (Tickets are available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.factandfictionbooks.com/event/2009/09/23/day" title="Fact &amp; Fiction">Fact &amp; Fiction</a>.)</I>
</p>
<p>
<b>New West: One of the distinctive aspects of <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I> is a contrast between the book&#8217;s lighthearted subject matter and the darker themes it addresses throughout&#8212;it&#8217;s the story of Daria, a pretty, plucky young woman who wants to succeed in work and love, and the tone is often comic, but then she has to deal with things like anti-Semitism, murderous gangsters, poverty, and the deprivations that come with living in Odessa.&nbsp; How did you balance these contrasting aspects of the book?&nbsp; Did you know when you started writing it what tone you wanted to strike?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Janet Skeslien Charles:</b> When I lived in Odessa, Ukraine, I was struck by the way Odessans used humor as a way of dealing with painful situations. When a coworker got an abortion, it was gossiped about and the other women joked, &#8220;She&#8217;s doing her part to keep the population down.&#8221; I thought they were barbarians. It was only much later that I realized that most of the women sitting at the table had had an abortion. It was the only option available to them in Soviet times. They joked about it to cover up their own sadness, and it was a form of bravado. When I set the book in Odessa, the humor capital of the former Soviet Union, I knew my characters had to have the same tough reactions. It was important to show the daily difficulties that people there encountered. 
</p>
<p>
The topic of the book, email-order brides, is a dark one. Congress passed the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 because of the &#8220;high incidence of violent abuse of foreign women brought to this country as fianc&#233;es or spouses by American men whom they meet through for-profit international marriage brokers (IMB).&#8221; An estimated 150,000 foreign women advertise themselves on IMB sites. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, one-third to one-half of all foreign fianc&#233;es admitted to the U.S. each year &#8211; 9,500 to 14,500 in 2004 &#8211; met their husbands through IMBs. Two of my Odessan friends married men from the West and it was an absolute disaster. I wanted to tell the story of women who chase the American Dream only to live a nightmare.
<br />
 
<br />
<b>NW: It seems like many recent novels set in the countries of the former Soviet Union are at least in part comic or satirical, such as your novel, Jonathan Safran Foer&#8217;s <I>Everything is Illuminated</I>, and Gary Shteyngart&#8217;s <I>Absurdistan</I>.&nbsp; Do you think the setting lends itself to a comic tone?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> You are kind to compare <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I> to <I>Everything is Illuminated</I> and <I>Absurdistan</I>. Humor can grow from sad soil. It seems to me that if the humorous and the tragic are balanced, both become stronger. It is a matter of shading. It was my hope that the darker elements could be brought to light with humor and that humor could intensify the more sinister elements of the book.
</p>
<p>
It is frustrating that as a female writer who has chosen humor as a vehicle to tell a dark story, my novel has been called &#8220;chick lit,&#8221; a term I appreciate as much as I appreciate &#8220;chick marine&#8221; or &#8220;chick surgeon.&#8221; I look at the back of books and at literary sites and see descriptions like &#8220;Chick Lit,&#8221; &#8220;Jewish Interest,&#8221; &#8220;African-American Studies,&#8221; and &#8220;Asian Voices.&#8221; By using such labels, we eliminate anything that is not produced by a white male as literature, which brings us right back to the 1800&#8217;s when books were written predominately by well-to-do white males.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What was your process for writing <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I>&#8212;how long did it take, how many drafts did you work through, and how did you find a publisher when it was ready?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> Upon returning to Montana from Odessa in 1996, I started writing stories about the people I had met there. It took a long time for my skill to catch up with the vision I had of the stories. For ten years, I worked on two different novels. When I could take the first no further, I set it aside and worked on the second and did research. When I could take the second no further, I returned to the first or worked on my collection of personal essays. 
</p>
<p>
I spent three months crafting a query letter and synopsis, sent them out to five agents, and received contracts from three. My agent Laura Longrigg sent the manuscript out and sold it in ten days.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You said that when you were in college, you had a job &#8220;translating letters from lonely Montanan men and desperate Russian women.&#8221;  How did you get that job?&nbsp; Was there a Montana-based matchmaking service?&nbsp; And did you consider writing about this back then?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> It was not a formal position. People heard that I was studying Russian and asked me to translate their correspondence. The letters were fascinating. What surprised me most was how business-like they were. &#8220;This is who I am, this is what I want. Can you provide it?&#8221; I did not think about writing about Russian brides back then. It wasn&#8217;t until the story became more personal that I became interested. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: For a state of its population, Montana seems to produce a lot of writers.&nbsp; Were you aware of or influenced by the writing culture in Montana when you were growing up?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> We are lucky to have so many strong writers in Montana. I remember holding <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_deirdre_mcnamer/C39/L39/" title="Deirdre McNamer">Deirdre McNamer</a>&#8217;s novel <I>Rima in the Weeds</I> and thinking, &#8220;Yes, it can be done. Someone from rural Montana can write books.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Growing up in Montana was a gift. In my family, we were encouraged to read and use our imaginations. As children, my friends and I created our own games and activities. This background was vital to me as a writer. Creating stories and worlds is something that I have done since I was a child.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You&#8217;ve said in an interview that it might be easier to write in Montana than the other places you&#8217;ve lived, because it offers less distraction.&nbsp; Do you think you might return to Montana some day?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> I love Montana and would love to live here. It would be a dream to teach writing at the college level in the West. 
</p>
<p>
What I like about Montana is the inner peace one can find. The quiet beauty of the plains calms and inspires me. Paris is a rich, inspiring city. Like most Parisians, my husband and I live in an apartment, which means we hear everything our neighbors do and much of what goes on in the city. It can be challenging to write in an agitated environment.&nbsp;  
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Is <i>Moonlight in Odessa</i> your first published work of fiction?&nbsp; Have you set your other writing in the different countries you&#8217;ve lived in, or have you ever set something in Montana?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> My poetry and prose has been published in literary journals. One of my short stories is in the fall issue of Slice magazine. Mainly, I&#8217;ve spent a decade receiving very kind rejection letters. 
</p>
<p>
Many of my personal essays are set in France. I have a lot of shorter pieces set in Montana.&nbsp; I have three projects that I am working on. After they are completed, I&#8217;ll turn to life in Montana.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You&#8217;ve said your next novel will also be set in Odessa.&nbsp; Do any of the characters carry over into it?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> Yes, several of the characters from <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I> will be in the second novel as well. One of my goals is to show the same events from different perspectives. For example, Daria, the main character of <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I>, is accepting of the mail-order bride business. She wants to get married and have a family. In the second novel, we&#8217;ll see socials from her American friend&#8217;s point of view. Jane is not at all ready for marriage and is disgusted by the advertisements for socials that tout the &#8220;diamond-shaped calves&#8221; of Ukrainian women who walk in high heels.
</p>
<p>
It was tempting to denounce international marriage brokers in <I>Moonlight in Odessa</I>. It would have been very easy to let my stance on the business creep into the text. But Daria is not a Western feminist. She was raised to believe that marriage is the best thing that can happen to a girl. Her grandmother pushes her to marry a stranger. I had to stay true to Daria. My agenda as an author was secondary. I would never want to preach or judge. 
</p>
<p>
Living in Odessa from 1994-6, I saw for myself how young women were judged when they did not get married right away. When people learned I wasn&#8217;t married at 23, they asked, completely puzzled, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What kinds of people take your writer&#8217;s workshop in Paris?&nbsp; What is your favorite bit of advice to give them?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>JSC:</b> Many of my students were college professors and administrators, journalists, and published nonfiction writers. One student was the curator of a major museum in Paris. What they had in common was that they wanted to write in a different way. The PhDs wanted to write in a more natural, carefree style. The journalists and nonfiction writers were dying to try fiction but felt inhibited. They had stuck to the facts for so long that it was hard for them to write stories they invented. I also had many American and French university students &#8211; for example, NYU and Colombia have study abroad programs in Paris. We always had a mix of ages, backgrounds, and nationalities. My advice then and now is to write, to keep going, and to see where the story takes you.

		<b>Comment By Galactic Love, 9-20-09</b>
		<p>It would be nice if the author was a little more balanced in her approach to this subject and not flat out biased which is illustrated by her insistence on using the term "Mail Order Bride".  <br />
<br />
She pretends to champion these women but in reality she's merely directing nothing short of a racist slur against them.   <br />
<br />
Let's get one thing straight.. there is NO such thing as a Mail Order Bride.. <br />
<br />
Women from the Former Soviet Union are not sold as commodities on a website.  Introduction agencies have many faults and I for one do not recommend them but to actually live in the Ukraine and then have the lack of class to still refer to the women she's met as "Mail Order Brides" is outrageous. <br />
<br />
I'm an american living in the FSU.  And I've seen incredible women filled with beauty, strength and character.  These women deserve far better representation then the "desperate" victims they are portrayed to be in this article. <br />
<br />
Furthermore I give any man credit for having the courage to look for a wife outside of his own country.   There is good and bad in everything and everyone but to simply portray these men as "desperate" as well just stinks to high heaven with typical feminist envy.  <br />
<br />
Given the underlying tone of jealousy that this author seems to direct at these traditionally feminine Ukrainian Women... I'd say that these "desperate" men are actually quite "enlightened" to shun any arrogant American women who wishes to label them in this manner and to seek love and a future family outside of their borders.  <br />
<br />
Full Disclosure:  I am the author of "Russian Women the Real Truth"  just google it for more info on what these women are really all about.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael, 9-21-09</b>
		<p>This woman repeats the lie that there is a “high incidence of violent abuse of foreign women brought to this country as fiancées or spouses by American men whom they meet through for-profit international marriage brokers (IMB).”  This lie was created by feminists to smear American men and to promote marriage fraud.  She further states that two of her "Odessan friends married men from "the West" and it was an absolute disaster".  She does not state whether these friends met through an agency or if they were married to Americans.  Given the vagueness of her statement, I would have to assume that they neither met through an agency nor married Americans, but the implication smears American men and IMB's and reinforces the IMBRA lie.  If they were chasing "The American Dream" rather than looking for love, then it should not be a surprise that their marriages ended in disaster and the blame lies on them and not the men they married.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Ada, 9-22-09</b>
		<p>Dear all,<br />
The Email Order Bride is a marvel of subtlety and sensitivity when it comes to portraying both Ukrainian women and American men (and many other people as well). I encourage everyone who reads this interview to actually go and read the novel. I hope that you will, as I did, come out of the experience enriched with a deeper, more fresh understanding of both cultures, as well as of the ways they relate to each other.<br />
Happy reading!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Galactic Love, 9-22-09</b>
		<p>Ada..<br />
<br />
Why in God's name are you calling women from the Ukraine and the FSU "Email Order Bride(s)"<br />
<br />
Please re-read my first comment above.   The term "(e)Mail Order Bride" is an outrageous racist slur designed to paint both Men and Women who engage in international relationships as "desperate". <br />
<br />
This is an all too transparent feminist ploy to try to "shame" men and women from both sides of the ocean to not try to find love and family with each other. <br />
<br />
Sorry ladies.. but the barn doors are already open and this type of language projected from yourselves only goes to prove the obvious. <br />
<br />
American and Western Men are much better off as a whole looking internationally for their spouse options then with the many domestic women who display a toxic mix of jealousy and ignorance as demonstrated in their loose usage of the "Mail Order Bride" term.  <br />
<br />
How anyone can believe the "sensitivity" of a book whose author label's these women as Mail Order commodities in an effort to satisfy an outdated feminist agenda is beyond me. <br />
<br />
Could you imagine any foreign woman writing a novel about her time in the US and openly labeling American Women as stereotypical "Arrogant Bit**es"?  Would you embrace a book like that?   <br />
<br />
Bottom line..  If you want Men to respect you.. start with respecting your international sisters first.  Especially after the hospitality and kindness I'm sure they showed you during your time there.</p>

							Wyoming and Denver resident Annie Proulx wrote a scathing review of the recent Academy Awards in the London newspaper <a target="_blank" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1727309,00.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> this weekend.  She blasts "conservative heffalump academy voters" and says that awarding the Best Picture Oscar to <i>Crash</i> "was a safe pick of 'controversial film' for the heffalumps."

		<p>Ditto ewitch's comments, plus: Annie Proulx's narcissitic obsession with her laboriously self-infatuated, meticulously posed, cloyingly clever and market-kissing writing is, in a word, boorish.           <br />
<br />
She'd perform a much greater service, and embarrass herself less, by addressing her complaints to the bathroom mirror. She accuses the Academy of doing exactly what she's done with her literary career which has become a sumptuously endowed package of trendiness awash in a sea of exquisitely correct writer's colony ooh-talk. <br />
<br />
I would gladly have let her limp off into the sunset Oscarless and underappreciated, but her embarrassing Guardian piece red-lined this Montana prairie dog's BS meter and left no choice but to call her hand for what it is, queen high over deuces.</p>

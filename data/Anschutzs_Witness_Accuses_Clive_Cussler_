							<p>Since February, Denver businessman Phil Anschutz and Arizona-based writer Clive Cussler have been battling in court over the fate of the screen adaptation of Cussler&#8217;s 1992 Dirk Pitt adventure novel, <I>Sahara</I>, which was made into a box-office bomb of a movie in 2005 by Anschutz&#8217;s Crusader Entertainment.&nbsp; (EW.com offers an informative <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015086,00.html" title="timeline here">timeline here</a>.)  Cussler filed a lawsuit over the fiasco, and Crusader Entertainment countersued.&nbsp; Tom McGhee of the Denver Post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_4899828" title="wrote about the lawsuits here">wrote about the lawsuits here</a>--basically, each side says the other is to blame for the financial failure of the film.&nbsp; Last week, there was a development in the trial that should be of interest to writers: Screenwriting teacher Robert McKee (who played himself in a cameo as a screenwriting teacher in <a target="_blank" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0268126/" title="Adaptation">Adaptation</a>) appeared as an expert witness for Crusader Entertainment and vilified Cussler for bad writing.&nbsp; Glenn F. Bunting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-fi-mckee11apr11,0,4911513.story?coll=cl-movies" title="of the L.A. Times">of the L.A. Times</a> quotes McKee as saying: &#8220;I mean, I cannot overstate how terrible the writing is.&nbsp; It is flawed in every way writing can be flawed.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
Cussler didn&#8217;t respond to this assertion, but his lawyer did:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Attorney Bertram Fields said McKee&#8217;s verbal attacks were &#8216;totally irrelevant&#8217; to the case. &#8216;He is a very good actor and he uses colorful language,&#8217; Fields said. &#8216;I think he was all wet.&#8217;  
</p>
<p>
Notice that Fields didn&#8217;t make any claims for the timeless literary qualities of Cussler&#8217;s fiction.&nbsp; Those of us who didn&#8217;t lose money on the development of <i>Sahara</i> can sit back and enjoy the rest of McKee&#8217;s reflections on Cussler&#8217;s writing:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The writing is very bad. How bad? I have thought of phrases like &#8217;seriously flawed&#8217; [or] &#8216;fatally flawed.&#8217; But it is beyond all of that, because when something is flawed there is an implication that something else about it is good&#8230; On average, there is something unbelievable happening every two minutes.&#8221;

		<p>Cussler's writing is really, really bad.  What can you say about a man who writes a cameo for himself into every book?  Some craggy stranger shows up, saves Dirk Pitt's bacon, and Pitt looks at him and says, "You look familiar, friend.  What's your name?" and the mysterious stranger invariably (and without recognition from Pitt) says, "Cussler.  Clive Cussler."  <br />
<br />
It's dreck!  Dreck!</p>

		<p>I keep hearing the phrase box-office bomb associated with this movie.  From an online source such as Box Office Mojo, the movie had a $130 million production budget and has garnered $120 million gross worldwide.  Assuming that the budget wasn't blown, and the numbers are accurate, it isn't that far off considering future dvd rentals, etc.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think The Adventures of Pluto Nash should be a standard for what a box-office bom should be: $100 million production budge and $7 million gross worldwide.<br />
<br />
By comparison, Sahara is in a breakeven category.</p>

		<p>clive cusslers writing is terrible, dire! and always unbelievable, the worst phrases that he uses on almost every other page is 'little did he know he would be dead before so and so....' or he didnt know it but .... etc... <br />
<br />
it drives me nuts, how can such a bad writer still publish books? and make so much money? i blame the low IQ of the average american paperback reader...<br />
<br />
a twelve year old could write a better book!</p>

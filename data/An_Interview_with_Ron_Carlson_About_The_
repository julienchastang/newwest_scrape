							<p><I>Utah native <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_ron_carlson/C39/L39/" title="Ron Carlson">Ron Carlson</a> has been publishing acclaimed novels and short stories for over three decades, and in recent years he&#8217;s hit a stride, with two novels, </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/mountain_men_ron_carlsons_five_skies/C39/L39/" title="Five Skies">Five Skies</a><I> and the new </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/into_the_woods_ron_carlsons_the_signal/C39/L39/" title="The Signal">The Signal</a><I> back-to-back.&nbsp; Carlson directed the Creative Writing program at Arizona State University for many years and three years ago became the Creative Writing program director at the University of California at Irvine. </I>The Signal<I>, which Carlson wrote at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucrossfoundation.org/" title="Ucross Foundation">Ucross Foundation</a> in Wyoming, is the action-packed tale of a divorced couple who go backpacking in the Wind River Mountains and run into all sorts of trouble, including some unfriendly meth-runners who poach elk on the side.&nbsp; I recently spoke with Carlson about his new novel, which he started because he &#8220;wanted to stand up behind [his] goddamn pickup truck again,&#8221; and about how &#8220;camping is essentially about when things go wrong.&#8221;</I>
</p>
<p>
<b>New West: Is <I>The Signal</I> just an elaborate way for you to scare other potential campers off of your favorite hiking trail?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Ron Carlson:</b> You know, it has that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t mean to scare everybody.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: In the front of the book, you advise people, &#8220;If I was going to go into the Wind Rivers today, I would use the Bears Ears trailhead and I would go before September 10.&#8221;  But after reading about all the perils that Mack and Vonnie face, nobody is going to want to go on this trail.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I just wanted to make sure that no one went after then, because you can run into snow.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I think I&#8217;d rather run into snow than some of the things that Mack and Vonnie run into.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  I don&#8217;t want anybody to get snowed in the way I did, and I&#8217;ve written about that.&nbsp; What I really wanted to do was have my vicarious experience and write a little love letter to the mountains, which I&#8217;m not in enough.&nbsp; I just got on fire for that and wrote this outdoor book. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I once heard you mention how you can sometimes coax students into writing a better story by taking the story that they start with&#8212;which is often about some kind of drunken road trip, if I remember correctly&#8212;and have them add another layer of time to it, so that the voice is that of a changed, somewhat older person looking back on these events.&nbsp; It seems like <I>The Signal</I> works in somewhat of the same way&#8212;it&#8217;s a story about a camping trip, but everything is overlain with the tension and the past between Vonnie and Mack.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> In all fiction&#8212;and it&#8217;s not spoken of in these terms&#8212;but there are always two stories.&nbsp; The stories both have to function.&nbsp; The immediate story that&#8217;s right in our face needs to capture us.&nbsp; And then coming along under the boat like some ominous force there should be the other story that&#8217;s about some feature of the characters&#8217; hearts.&nbsp; Many times that has to do with the past.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You&#8217;ve said that you work intuitively, seeing where the story will lead you.&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t know if I buy it with this book&#8212;the structure is so precise, the action so taut, I feel like you must have had a blueprint for this one.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I know exactly what you&#8217;re saying.&nbsp; But this book just poured out of me.&nbsp; I wrote this in a blind, rushing dream.&nbsp; The draft took six days.&nbsp; It was like no writing experience I&#8217;ve ever had, and I hope I&#8217;ll have it again, but I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; I went up to Ucross in Wyoming and had the time, and I just got lost in the dream.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You had the idea in mind?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> Well, I didn&#8217;t exactly, no.&nbsp; I knew I wanted to write about backpacking.&nbsp; I start so much of my fiction from a kind of a hot fusion with an event or a moment.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t take much, but for some reason with my imagination, if you show me the right event or right moment&#8212;and it can be in a hotel lobby or out on a dark road at night, many times it relates to places I&#8217;ve been&#8212;I can just taste it.&nbsp; I started writing this story about these two people on this trip, and then later after I finished the draft, which was about two-thirds of the current book, I started thinking about who they were and what was Mack&#8217;s damage.&nbsp; One of the last scenes I wrote&#8212;which is on page 3 or 4&#8212;is the scene where Vonnie meets him in jail.&nbsp; So I just began to inform the book with this guy and his flaws and his troubles and his humanity.&nbsp; Then I started thinking about, what can I get away with in terms of: drugs are a problem in the West, poachers are a problem in the West, the mountains are so lovely, how much can I layer this?&nbsp; How far can I take this into harm&#8217;s way?&nbsp; That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re seeing.&nbsp; But if you look at all the historical information, that&#8217;s what I wrote last.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
It was a wonderful writing experience.&nbsp; I really participated in all of the hiking, walking, fishing, and cooking.&nbsp; And I was able to bring all of the things that I&#8217;ve done into it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m an old camper, and camping is essentially about when things go wrong.&nbsp; I mean, you forget something, a shoelace breaks.&nbsp; A shoelace breaking can be heartbreaking.&nbsp; I had one of the fasteners on my pack break once.&nbsp; I lost a dog leash&#8212;I had it around my neck, and I didn&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d dropped it.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; Wait, you had a dog leash around your neck?&nbsp; What were you doing in the woods?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Well, no, I was carrying it like a towel.&nbsp; I had my good dog Max with me on that trip.&nbsp; Anyway, the way everybody writes about camping, even in disasters where planes crash in the woods, I&#8217;m so sick of these fraudulent camping stories.&nbsp; Someone will follow the stream and a minute later they&#8217;re dry.&nbsp; Or the bugs bite them for a few minutes but then they stop biting.&nbsp; How did the bugs stop biting?&nbsp; I never saw the bugs stop biting.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden there&#8217;s a campfire and we&#8217;re enjoying our whiskey around the campfire.&nbsp; Fires are hard and they take tending.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a lot of up and down and work, work, work.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; But a lot of good meals in your camping stories.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Yeah, a lot of good meals.&nbsp; And of course there&#8217;s nothing better than cut fingers and dirty hands to improve a bowl of soup.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; An apple never tastes better than when it&#8217;s eaten at high altitude.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Exactly, you know all about it.&nbsp; So, the opening draft of this book was a rushing dream, then I&#8217;m an old teacher so there was a lot of calculation and designing.&nbsp; I also knew it would be a short book that a person would read in one or two sittings.&nbsp; It was so fun.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; It seems that you&#8217;re in a fertile creative period right now.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve done two novels back to back in a short span.&nbsp; Do you feel that way? </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  I am.&nbsp; I&#8217;m working hard.&nbsp; I just got back from Rhode Island, where <I>Five Skies</I> is the One Book Rhode Island 2009 selection.&nbsp; I had breakfast with 500 people.&nbsp; It was quite a discussion group, really lovely.&nbsp; And then this book came hot on the heels of that, and because they both take place outdoors and deal primarily with men, they seem related.&nbsp; I continue to write about men, but this new work is all over the place again.&nbsp; I&#8217;m writing some comic stuff.&nbsp; I&#8217;m doing some stories, but I have another novel draft that I&#8217;ll be working on this summer, so I&#8217;m working on things side by side.&nbsp; I sort of need an assistant right now because I have too many drafts and I don&#8217;t know what level they&#8217;re in.&nbsp; So the answer to your question is yes, it is a fertile creative period for me.&nbsp; That&#8217;s primarily because I&#8217;ve simply focused my energies and I do a lot of work.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wait for the summer.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be up in Utah again and then I&#8217;m going to teach in Aspen at the end of June.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; So do you only get to go to the interior West in the summer now?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Well, what you call the interior West is the West.&nbsp; Denver, Salt Lake, Boise, Missoula, Flagstaff.&nbsp; Ohio is not the West.&nbsp; California is not the West.&nbsp; California is California.&nbsp; I need the West, like the intermountain West, where there&#8217;s a town and then you can get out of town.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re in Philadelphia and they say &#8220;get out of town,&#8221; you end up in New York.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m not an end-of-the-roader or a desperate off-the-grid guy, but I&#8217;ve always cherished, from a boy, getting out of town.&nbsp; My feeling about the woods I got fifty years ago from my dad when we&#8217;d go fishing up in the Uintas of Utah, and I saw that there were places into the trees that I didn&#8217;t know about.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a place beyond the last tree that you don&#8217;t know about, and I love that feeling.&nbsp; I do everything I can to try to find that.&nbsp; I live three blocks from the ocean now, which is sort of interesting, I&#8217;ve never done it before.&nbsp; I like to get back into the interior continent to where I can see it&#8217;s a planet again.&nbsp; You get out of the city and out of the suburban grid.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#8217;s in southern Utah where it happens, sometimes it&#8217;s in the desert between California and Nevada, and you can sense, oh yeah, this place.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s been lovely here in California.&nbsp; I&#8217;m the director of the Creative Writing Program at U.C. Irvine and I&#8217;m working with some amazing people.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Speaking of your father, one of my favorite passages in <I>The Signal</I> was on page 91, when Mack realizes that he was associating with drug dealers now, so &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t going to be fresh oil in the engines or good tires or a tight lug nut or any single thing done right.&nbsp; This was a free fall at the shiterie.&#8221;  This seems to be a recurrent theme of yours, especially in your prior novel, that precision and carefully done work are the sign of a life being lived well, and shoddy work is the sign of trouble.&nbsp; I think the last time I interviewed you, you mentioned that your dad was a handy guy.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Yeah, he was.&nbsp; He was just one of the most intelligent and sensible men I&#8217;ve ever known.&nbsp; He was a successful engineer.&nbsp; But his whole life was that&#8212;he respected his tools, he measured things well.&nbsp; For a guy that had all that exactitude in his life, he was hugely tolerant and very kind.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; He seems a lot like Mack&#8217;s father.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Well, that was sort of the easiest part to write, wasn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; Yeah, he is.&nbsp; I was fortunate to have interesting parents, good parents, good people.&nbsp; I knew them as people for a long time&#8212;I had them until four or five years ago.&nbsp; I think they color my work.&nbsp; We&#8217;re in an age when I think there&#8217;s a lot of confusion about how to do things, and I think there&#8217;s a lot of confusion about work and the value of work.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think people understand how work is really the saving element.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; Mack&#8217;s father doesn&#8217;t appear much in this book, but you get to know him well because the dialogue is very vivid.&nbsp; Is it easy for you to write dialogue?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> When I wrote this book, I didn&#8217;t use quotation marks or paragraph, it&#8217;s just the flow.&nbsp; But at the same time when a writer&#8217;s working, a scene opens and you have to fall into it.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t cruise by it and phone it in.&nbsp; You drop into the chasm with your characters and you participate, you listen.&nbsp; Every time Mack and his father talked, I learned something new.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; Like the thing about his hands, &#8220;Show me your hands,"&#8212;where did that come from?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> Well that came from that moment.&nbsp; I was writing there and Mack&#8217;s dad says, &#8220;Show me your hands.&#8221;  Then I thought, &#8220;Uh oh.&#8221;  Of course the phrase &#8220;a show of hands&#8221; is sort of odd.&nbsp; I was so lucky to get that.&nbsp; It is made up but it felt true.&nbsp; I&#8217;m to the point where sometimes I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m making something up or remembering it.&nbsp; You can tell&#8212;if a guy comes in with Band-aids on his hands all the time, you don&#8217;t want him working on your car.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: There are several new technologies that are integral parts of the plot of <I>The Signal</I>&#8212;the BlackBerry with GPS, the non-functioning cell phone and the experimental drone.&nbsp; The advent of the cell phone has taken away a lot of possible plots, like that of <I>Romeo &amp; Juliet</I>, but has technology created more possible plots?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> I think we&#8217;re catching up with technology.&nbsp; It&#8217;s vexatious for me.&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re in this signature moment that people are trying to catch up to technology so fast that they&#8217;re making a lot of mistakes with giving their lives over to email, using the Internet in all the ways we do, and the whole compulsion with the cell phone.&nbsp; I think the story isn&#8217;t told yet with technology.&nbsp; It will be very interesting to see what happens with newspapers and all forms of media, because I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just going to go one way.&nbsp; I think it will settle down and there will be a little bit of reaction, and we&#8217;ll end up with hard copy and electronic copy.
</p>
<p>
But in terms of plot, I&#8217;m just not sure.&nbsp; I always loved Agatha Christie&#8217;s <I>Ten Little Indians</I>, and the fact that people could be isolated on an island and one by one they&#8217;d get knocked off.&nbsp; But now if the phone line goes out&#8212;you can&#8217;t go around and clip the wires on everybody&#8217;s cell phone, so it&#8217;s hard to isolate people.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; There are so many plots that hinge upon people not having the information that they could have if they were in communication with each other.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  It&#8217;s very much the story of having a person be in once place at one time.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the rarity we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp; Nobody&#8217;s here anymore because they&#8217;re all everywhere at one time.&nbsp; When you&#8217;re in a room with twenty people and their cell phones are on, you&#8217;re with everybody they&#8217;ve ever talked to on the phone.&nbsp; So there are 10,000 people there.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really disgusting.&nbsp; With my students, I have a rule&#8212;I tell them that you may not get on the cell phone until 15 minutes after the class is over.&nbsp; I want you to think about what we did.
</p>
<p>
I worry about the fifth graders in this country, being everywhere all the time.&nbsp; Whenever you see a woman walking under the trees, she always has a hand to her ear.&nbsp; You never see a woman walking under the trees anymore.&nbsp; The walk is just ruined.&nbsp; Nobody walks anymore.&nbsp; It&#8217;s always this multitasking, which is essentially doing two things badly at once.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; How did you come up with the idea of having Mack need to locate a crashed drone&#8212;it seems almost like a thriller element. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Well that element is.&nbsp; I thought, &#8220;Can I go this big?&#8221;  So I said yeah, I&#8217;ll have this one plot point.&nbsp; There are a lot of experimental aircraft, a lot of them are private, there are a lot of independent contractors who are desperate characters, and there are a lot of former government employees who are trying to figure out ways of profiteering.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not pervasive, but it exists.&nbsp; There are a lot of retired upper military Defense Department types in the West, former cabinet secretaries, et cetera.&nbsp; We hear about drones all the time now&#8212;they&#8217;re not the cute little ones I had, but these very big million dollar unmanned aircraft.&nbsp; They&#8217;re flown all over Afghanistan and Pakistan, and they&#8217;re piloted from Arizona.&nbsp; It&#8217;s sort of horrifying, philosophically, to be able to kill people that way.&nbsp; But it is a thriller element. 
</p>
<p>
This book could have been a relationship story of two people in the woods, and I thought no, I&#8217;m going to reach here.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to take a chance and make something kind of larger than life and hope that I&#8217;m forgiven for it.&nbsp; I wanted a lot to happen, more than I could handle.&nbsp; As I worked on the last fifty pages of this book you can see that I&#8217;m sort of minimal.&nbsp; Anything that I could tuck away without having to explain it, I did.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; I wrote in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/into_the_woods_ron_carlsons_the_signal/C39/L39/" title="my review">my review</a> that it seemed like it would take somebody else 400 pages to write this 200 page book.&nbsp; Did all your work with short stories help you to condense?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  Thank you.&nbsp; I am a writer who wants his writing to have density.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t need a four-pound book.&nbsp; I want the story to have real voltage.&nbsp; A little writing can carry lots of volts.&nbsp; That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;m working now.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the way I worked on short stories, and I&#8217;m sure it helped me.&nbsp; In a story you have to get a whole world up, deal with it, and then done.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; How do you get to that?&nbsp; Do you start with something bigger and then cut out?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  I always start small.&nbsp; I started with a guy, and I wanted him cooking on a stove on the back of his truck.&nbsp; I started this book because I wanted to stand up behind my goddamn pickup truck again.&nbsp; I miss it so much.&nbsp; I had an old stove, a couple of emergency knives.&nbsp; I could cook soup anywhere I was.&nbsp; I really do miss it.&nbsp; I had a dog and a pickup for twenty years.&nbsp; And now I have this other life.&nbsp; I love the idea of pulling off in the lost place and making some tea.&nbsp; So this guy has angel hair pasta, boiling water for it on the back of his truck.&nbsp; You start that small.&nbsp; Then he&#8217;s hoping she comes.&nbsp; Then the book unfolds.&nbsp; You can see it in my work.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a little different&#8212;you kind of spotted the fact that there are some things in this book that feel imposed and other things that grow out of the text.&nbsp; I wanted this to be organic so that I could earn those other moments.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; The primary cause that drove Mack into his descent was economic difficulty.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  What I wanted to do was, I&#8217;m a big fan of wear and tear.&nbsp; So you put a guy who is sort of ashamed of what he&#8217;s doing, he&#8217;s got the pressure of a certain amount of guilt for what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp; He&#8217;s worried about money.&nbsp; He starts drinking.&nbsp; He loses the boundary between his own code and taking help.&nbsp; He can&#8217;t take help because he&#8217;s too fucking proud.&nbsp; Then he makes mistakes.&nbsp; I wanted to earn that.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want his troubles to be because he was just a bad guy, and I didn&#8217;t want his troubles to be finessed.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; So what he did is his responsibility.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b> Yeah, he&#8217;s going to do it and then when he&#8217;s kind of worn down a little bit, he gets this opportunity.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s a bad choice.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I wanted to ask you about the late <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/tribute_to_a_champion_of_western_literature/C39/L39/" title="Carol Houck-Smith">Carol Houck-Smith</a>, who passed away recently and used to be your editor.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>RC:</b>  I met Carol when I was 27, 28 years old, a long time ago, and we did six books together at Norton.&nbsp; It&#8217;s such a treasure to me to have had this classic New York editor experience with such a professional person who was very interested in my work.&nbsp; I met her through the mail.&nbsp; I sent her part of a book and she said, &#8220;This is interesting, let&#8217;s talk.&#8221;  I went to New York in 1976 and we met and we worked together all that time.&nbsp; I was her first fiction writer and I was the luckiest guy.&nbsp; I have a new editor now at Viking, Josh Kendall, and he&#8217;s very bright and capable and I just love him.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m in the right place.&nbsp; But Carol was a very close personal friend of mine.&nbsp; She was there in the courtroom when the adoption of my kids was finalized and she spent Christmas with us. 
</p>
<p>
I miss her.&nbsp; I was from Utah, and it was so exciting when I walked into those offices across from the New York Public Library and she stood up and greeted me and she said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking for you.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve been looking for <I>you</I>.&#8221;  No one was treated better than me and we did some quality work together.&nbsp; She stood by me and I tried to return the favor for her.

		<p>Just finished The Signal, on the recommendation of a friend.  Wonderful book, and I was really glad to run across this interview online.  I'm a writing student, and this told me just about all I'd wanted to ask the author himself about how the book was put together. Thanks!</p>

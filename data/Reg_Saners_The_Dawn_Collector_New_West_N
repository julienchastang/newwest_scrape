							In his recent collection of essays, <a href="http://regsaner.com/work5.htm" title="The Dawn Collector: On My Way to the Natural World">The Dawn Collector: On My Way to the Natural World</a> (<a href="http://www.americanplaces.org/about_us/" title="Center for American Places">Center for American Places</a>, 2005), longtime Coloradoan <a href="http://regsaner.com/" title="Reg Saner">Reg Saner</a> explores the flora and fauna that he finds on his daily walks near his home at the foot of Table Mesa in Boulder—he "collects" dawns, often heading out at first light.  Saner also describes journeys further afield, including a canoe trip in Utah's Green River, a Labor Day expedition up Longs Peak, and a trip back to his beginnings at his grandmother's house in Depression-era Illinois.  The book of fourteen essays—written in singing prose that is befitting of an award-winning poet such as Saner—is so packed full of good bits that it's difficult to know where to begin in discussing it.  <i>The Dawn Collector</i> will hold a special appeal to readers familiar with the terrain Saner discusses: Reading this book is like going on a hike with a friend who is much more perceptive and informed than you are, but never pedantically so.<br />
<br />
"My Grandmother's House," the essay that begins the collection, differs from the rest of the book in that it's set outside the West (in Illinois) and it doesn't explicitly focus on nature.  Yet it serves as an apt guide to how one avid naturalist was formed. Saner grew up near a school for the blind, and he writes, "Lifelong…all those blind boys—the youngest barely older than I was—gave me a wealth, an awareness few people have.  Thanks to them, I've always known I can see."  "My Grandmother's House" is the most moving piece in the book, detailing the life of a woman who was tough, generous, loving, and imbued with the sort of 1930's common sense that seems to have gone missing in contemporary Americans.  Saner has portrayed his grandmother so artfully that even after knowing her for only 25 pages, the reader keenly misses her when she's gone.<br />
<br />
Equipped with the knowledge that he is gifted with sight, Saner moves forward into the natural world, where he turns his gaze on phenomenon both ordinary and extraordinary.  In "The Deer Who Came to Dinner," an essay that will be of particular interest to Boulder residents, Saner details his love-hate relationship with the roving town deer, and describes the methods and talismans that local gardeners have used to stop the deer from destroying backyard plants: "Though the Boulder Valley has far more tekkies than deer, our gardeners aren't keen on gadgetry.  Some try mothballs, human hair bagged in an old nylon stocking, bloodmeal, citrus oil, what have you...[Gardeners buy] bottles of animal urine collected from carnivores such as coyotes, foxes, bobcats, and even wolves.  I know one man who tried drinking quantities of tea, then collecting his own.  Others spread the scat of meat-eating animals…[some have] tried the malodorous dung from African lions in the Denver Zoo."  Still, despite the unremitting ungulate destruction of Saner's garden, he writes, "Deer are like children. You can't stay mad at them for long."<br />
<br />
Another essay that addresses the problems that come from living adjacent to wildlife habitat is "Lions in the Streets."  Saner's sentiments about living in mountain lion territory reflect those of a typical nature-loving westerner: "As a forest worshiping, clean camping, soft walking, save the salmon type, I hold that homeowners encroaching on lion habitat have asked for whatever they get.  That was before the big cats started cruising <i>our</i> neighborhood.  Once youngsters showed up, I got what I hadn't asked for: perplexity."  Saner explores the full measure of his perplexity, weighing his concern for the neighborhood children against his desire to allow mountain lions to rove their natural habitat.<br />
<br />
Saner pays attention to smaller fauna as well, trying to come to an understanding with the magpie (in "Man, Woman, Magpie"), a variety of bird against which he has nurtured a grudge since he saw a magpie destroy a nest of songbirds in his back yard.  He roots for a colony of marmots he finds pioneering on Table Mesa, at a much lower elevation than is customary or wise in "Dexter; or Right Foot First."  And, as any contemporary nature writer must, he ponders the increasing incursion of humans into areas that previously saw little traffic, as he does in his entertaining "Longs Peak Labor Day Weekend Parade."  Saner stakes his tent near Longs Peak and describes and chats with the hordes of people who attempt to summit during one weekend, people who come in a surprising array of ages and fitness levels.<br />
<br />
There is no better time for an avid hiker to enjoy <i>The Dawn Collector</i> than in the middle of winter when many Western hiking areas are snowed in. Saner captures all of the seasons, and will serve as a thought-provoking companion when it's time to put on the hiking boots again.<br />
<br />
<i>The Dawn Collector</i> is also a beautiful object—a sturdily bound hardcover book with a pleasing shape that includes a gallery of photos.  It is the second volume of the Center for American Places' series of books on the American West.

		<b>Comment By Nick Santry, 1-03-06</b>
		<p>Jenny Shank's review of "The Dawn Collector" book by Reg Saner impelled my neighbor to buy three copies, one for each of his grown sons. He agrees with her about what he calls "a  beautiful book." Me, I'm very into astronomy, so I specially liked Saner's closing essay, "The Cosmos and Me."</p>

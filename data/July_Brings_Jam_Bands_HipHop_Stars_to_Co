		<h1>July Brings Jam Bands, Hip-Hop Stars to Colorado</h1>

							After a month that featured several multi-day concerts, July finds Colorado fairly bereft of these summer staples. The best bet for those seeking a festival atmosphere is the inaugural two-day <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bigsummerclassic.com/" title="Big Summer Classic">Big Summer Classic</a> that kicks off its national run at Red Rocks from July 2-3.  The cancellation of the proposed national Zooma tour was good news for the organizers of the Big Summer Classic, who are now well positioned to fulfill all patchouli oil salesmen’s demands for long days of windy jams. They’ve lined up headliner The String Cheese Incident (whose new studio album, <i>One Step Closer</i> is due out just days before this show), jam-friendly hip-hopper Michael Franti and his band Spearhead, guitar wizard Keller Williams, and Midwestern jazzy-jam group Umphrey’s McGee. All of these bands have signed up to play late night shows around the area, including Keller Williams’ midnight performance at Boulder’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxtheatre.com" title="Fox Theatre">Fox Theatre</a> on July 3. Tickets for all of these shows are selling briskly.<br />
<br />
Independence Day falls on a Monday this year, so there aren’t many concerts of note on the holiday itself except for the annual Blues Traveler appearance at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redrocksonline.com" title="Red Rocks">Red Rocks</a>. The venue offers fans the chance to watch fireworks lighting up the distant skies in every direction while John Popper and company serve up their hits.  This year’s show also boasts a decent headliner in mellow rockers The Wallflowers, who are touring behind their new <i>Rebel, Sweetheart</i>.<br />
<br />
A number of notable musicians will be performing indoors this month, including erstwhile Lemonheads frontman Evan Dando at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.larimerlounge.com" title="Larimer Lounge">Larimer Lounge</a> on July 10, and big-voiced, rootsy troubadour Ray Lamontagne, who plays at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fillmoreauditorium.com" title="Fillmore Auditorium">Fillmore Auditorium</a> on July 11 with Rachael Yamagata, a passionate young singer who pounds out tales of angry heartbreak on the piano.<br />
<br />
The major hip-hop tour of the summer, The Anger Management Tour 3, rolls into the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pepsicenter.com" title="Pepsi Center">Pepsi Center</a> on July 14, headed up by Eminem and his associates 50 Cent and D-12.  Slightly older audiences are more apt to enjoy ‘80s superstar Pat Benatar’s appearance at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1E003A8CAF2E6C6E?artistid=734537&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=1" title="Universal Lending Pavilion">Universal Lending Pavilion</a> on July 11.<br />
<br />
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.brendanbenson.com" title="Brendan Benson">Brendan Benson</a>, an expert singer-songwriter whose album of winsome, toe-tapping pop, <i>Alternative to Love</i>, is one of the best releases of the year, will round out the month with a Larimer Lounge performance on July 30. Also on July 30, local tongue-in-cheek Latin-tinged big band act <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cabaretdiosa.com" title="Cabaret Diosa">Cabaret Diosa</a> will play the Fox Theatre in Boulder to commemorate the release of its first studio album since 2001’s <i>Voodoo Piñata</i>. The theatrical group always mounts elaborate stage shows with costumes and props, particularly during its perennially sold-out Halloween affairs at the Boulder Theater, so this should make for an entertaining evening.<br />

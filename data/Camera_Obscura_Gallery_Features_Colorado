							When I first wandered into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cameraobscuragallery.com" title="The Camera Obscura Gallery">The Camera Obscura Gallery</a> in Denver several years ago, I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes. The small gallery sits in the shadow of the Denver Art Museum in a brick building on the corner of 13th and Bannock, and houses such a treasure trove of photographic masterpieces that it feels more like a pint-sized museum than a gallery. I wondered how I could have grown up in Denver and failed to hear about this wonderful place, which has become one of the first stops I recommend to out-of-town visitors. Octogenarian proprietor Hal Gould founded Camera Obscura in 1979, reportedly in part because Otto Karl Bach, the Denver Art Museumâ€™s director from 1944 to 1974, didnâ€™t recognize photography as a legitimate art form and therefore refused to acquire any photos for the DAM. <br />
<br />
Gould, a fine photographer in his own right, forged ahead, collecting prints by Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Walker Evans, Imogen Cunningham, and many others that would become iconic. (According to Gouldâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Gould" title="Wikipedia entry">Wikipedia entry</a>, in the early days he offered a Weston print of a pepper for sale for $25, an image that now sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars.) Today, Gould and his assistant Loretta Young-Gautier use the first floor of the gallery to display a new exhibition each month, and the second floor to house an extensive photography bookstore and rotating images from the galleryâ€™s collection. The Camera Obscura bursts with magnificent photosâ€”along the stairway, in the narrow hallways, and in the rooms where patrons can browse through prints for sale. The bathroom, appropriately, features several nudes.<br />
<br />
Gould, who was born in Wyoming, grew up in New Mexico, and moved to Colorado decades ago, often displays the work of regional photographers, as he does this month in the exhibition <i>John Ward: Land and Light in the American West</i>. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iipa.org/gallery/ward/" title="John Ward">John Ward</a>, who grew up in Denver and earned a Ph.D. in physics from CU Boulder in 1971, photographs the Western landscape using a large-format negative, an approach that allows him to capture sweeping vistas in crystalline detail. The show runs through July 17 and features images from Wardâ€™s 2004 book <i>Land and Light in the American West</i>, ranging over nine Western states with such landscapes as â€œDesert View; Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona,â€? â€œSangre de Cristo Range, Colorado,â€? and â€œTemple of the Sun; Capitol Reef National Park, Utah.â€?<br />
<br />
Visitors to the Camera Obscura shouldnâ€™t hesitate to ask Mr. Gould questions. Heâ€™s unmistakable: a slim, welcoming gentleman who sports a bolo tie for dressy occasions. Gould has many stories to tell of his travels to every continent, including a photographic expedition he undertook to Antarctica during the year he turned 80. He seems to have met virtually every important American photographer of the past century, and he has the pictures to prove it.

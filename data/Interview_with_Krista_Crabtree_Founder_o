							<p>I met Krista Crabtree, the woman behind the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sheskis.net/" title="She Skis Women's Ski Testing Clinic">She Skis Women&#8217;s Ski Testing Clinic</a>, when we were both in grad school at CU.&nbsp; She was studying poetry and doing an internship at <i>Ski Magazine</i>, and I learned that skiing had been a part of her life since she was a toddler.&nbsp; Krista grew up in New Hampshire, and started skiing when she was three years old.&nbsp; &#8220;My parents used to ski race,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;and back in those days you could put a baby in a backpack go up the hill.&#8221;  Her dad even raced with Krista or her brother strapped in a backpack.&nbsp; Krista started racing when she was very young, and remembers asking her father after her first race, &#8220;Dad, am I supposed to go right or left around the gates?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
In high school, Krista qualified for the Junior Olympics, and she skied for the Division I college team at Bates.&nbsp; After college, she moved to Vail and raced on the Women&#8217;s Pro Tour from 1995 to 1996. ("Unfortunately," she said, &#8220;it went bankrupt after a year.") Krista started coaching ski racing in 1994, so she says that she comes to her clinic &#8220;not from an instruction background, but a coaching background.&#8221;  She began an internship with <i>Ski Magazine</i> in 1998, and eventually rose to the rank of Senior Associate Editor, then left the position in 2005 before the birth of her daughter.
</p>
<p>
While at <i>Ski</i>, Krista wrote extensively about ski equipment, and was in charge of running the women&#8217;s ski test for several years.&nbsp; &#8220;I had 16 women and two days to test 30 pairs of skis,&#8221; Krista explained, &#8220;and then I wrote all the reviews.&#8221;  Last year, Krista organized the first <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sheskis.net/" title="She Skis clinic">She Skis clinic</a>, using two of the women who helped her with ski testing that are current Vail instructors.
</p>
<p>
I recently spoke with Krista Crabtree about her clinic, the special needs of female skiers, and the burgeoning equipment market for female skiers.
</p>
<p>
<b>New West: What is the purpose of the She Skis clinic?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Krista Crabtree:</b> She Skis is a women-only ski clinic designed to help women improve their technique, learn more about equipment and have a great time on snow. It&#8217;s a unique three-day experience that allows participants to ski on over 25 pairs of skis (all next year&#8217;s models), which usually only industry-folk get to do.&nbsp; Participants learn how to ski these new models in the varied terrain of Vail Resort. But there&#8217;s more to it than skiing: there&#8217;s an apr&#232;s-ski party every day where we eat, drink and talk about women&#8217;s gear.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Why is it important for skiers to test different equipment?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>KC</b>: You can learn a lot from skiing on different skis, such as what terrain they work best on, what snow conditions they perform best in, and how they turn. At the clinic, the instructors ski with the participants and instruct them every step of the way, and are there to talk about skiing and equipment at the apr&#232;s ski parties in the evenings. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: What sort of skiers are interested in regularly replacing their gear? Is it just ski racers and competitive skiers?</b>  
</p>
<p>
<b>KC:</b> Skis have gone through tremendous design changes in the past seven to ten years. Every year there&#8217;s more and more equipment made just for women. So if female skiers haven&#8217;t treated themselves in a while, it&#8217;s time! I think that people who are passionate about skiing and about staying on top of the gear curve are interested in replacing their gear. There are some great deals out there so it doesn&#8217;t have to break your purse.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How do women ski differently than men, and why do they need different equipment?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>KC:</b> Women&#8217;s bodies are built differently from men&#8217;s. Our hips tend to be wider, we have a lower center of gravity, our calf muscles tend to be wider than men&#8217;s toward our ankles. All these things affect the way we ski.&nbsp; When women get on skis that are too stiff, we have trouble turning them. When we&#8217;re set too far back on the ski, we get in the back seat.&nbsp; When the cuff of the ski boot runs too high on our calf, we cut off the circulation of blood to our toes. Women&#8217;s equipment addresses all of these issues.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Has special ski equipment designed for women been a recent development?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>KC:</b> It&#8217;s been on the horizon for the less than a decade but it has really taken off--because women realize how great it is to use a product designed just for them.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Has there been any effort for ski resorts to appeal to women specifically?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>KC:</b> Most every ski resort now offers some type of women&#8217;s ski program. They&#8217;ve realized that women are hungry to learn from other women in an empowering way.&nbsp; Clinics and camps for women are getting to be really popular because women are beginning to find the benefit in something designed just for them.&nbsp; Last year, the clinic went well--we had a small, cozy group.&nbsp; Everyone really enjoyed themselves and two women from the East coast want to come back this year. It&#8217;s not an aggro, super aggressive environment--it&#8217;s an empowering environment.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a lot of laughing and no ego involved.&nbsp; It gives people the chance to overcome their fears and work on their technique and have a great time doing it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of like spa treatment on skis.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Some studies suggest that skiing is declining in participation.&nbsp; Is that trend true among female skiers?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>KC</b>: I think the decline is not in Colorado, but in certain areas of the country. I don&#8217;t have the specific numbers, but I do know that ski companies have all invested millions of dollars in developing skis for women, and they would only invest money if there was a market there.&nbsp; The women&#8217;s ski market is not flat.&nbsp; Now that the gear is better, when a woman tries skiing, she finds it easier to turn, and she has a better time.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t turn your skis, you might not go back again.&nbsp; The women&#8217;s market is the fastest growing market in the outdoor industry and in the ski industry.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been amazing how popular gear made for women has become.

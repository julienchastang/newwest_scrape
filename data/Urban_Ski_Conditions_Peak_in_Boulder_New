							"Get some skis, people!" a smiling, spandex-clad cross-country skier called out to my husband and I as we jogged on the bike path through Boulder's Valmont Park on Saturday, pushing our baby in her stroller.  We were jealous.  Instead of slogging along down the icy bike path, we could have been gliding over the fresh snow, which had even been groomed with tracks forming a 1.4 mile loop for classic cross-country skiers, courtesy of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldernordic.org/" title="Boulder Nordic Ski Club">Boulder Nordic Ski Club</a>.  Skiers packed the park: skate skiers leaving V-shaped tracks, classic cross-country skiers practicing their technique with and without poles, and even some downhillers, mostly kids, taking runs down the little hills on the perimeter of the park.  <br />
<br />
We'd always thought it was more reasonable to rent skis the few times a year that we made it up to a cross-country ski resort, but with urban ski conditions at their peak in Boulder after Friday's fresh snowfall, we were lamenting that decision.  Why hadn't we forgone a few expensive dinners during our carefree pre-child years and spent the money instead on a pair of skate skis and boots for each of us?  And now we're stuck, ski-less in a snowbound Boulder, with Christmas bills looming and a 6-month-old baby growing like a weed, necessitating the purchase of a larger carseat and a bigger stroller.  (I've recently realized that the equipment upgrade cycle won't end until our daughter is sixteen and begging for a car.) There will be no skis for us this year.  And who knows if it'll ever snow like this again?<br />
<br />
I remember the whimsical sight of a cross-country skier shushing through the deserted, snow-packed streets of Capitol Hill in Denver after the March 2003 blizzard, the streetlights above him ignored as they cycled through their colors.  After years of drought, I thought those conditions were an aberration.  But here we are just a few years later, benefiting from three heavy snowstorms in a row, and once again the cross-country skiers are out, romping over the winter landscape.  <br />
<br />
Boulder offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getboulder.com/sports/ski_xintro.html" title="a number of prime locations">a number of prime locations</a> for skiers when the snowfall is good.  In addition to Valmont Park, there's North Boulder Park, and the Boulder Nordic Club keeps an updated posting of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldernordic.org/Default.aspx?tabid=97" title="in-town ski conditions">in-town ski conditions</a> on its website.  This year, according to a post on December 29, "All grooming operations are taking place at Valmont Park.  It's super over there, check it out!"  The website also notes that some of its members skied 50k through the park on New Year's Day.  Sigh.  Anybody want to let me borrow some skis?<br />

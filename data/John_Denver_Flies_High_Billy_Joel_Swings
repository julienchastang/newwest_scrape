							<p>This week the Colorado legislature voted to name John Denver&#8217;s &#8220;Rocky Mountain High&#8221; as one of the state&#8217;s official songs--it seems they couldn&#8217;t bring themselves to delist that old chestnut, &#8220;Where the Columbines Grow&#8221; as the state song.&nbsp; So now Colorado has at least one official song that some living people actually know.&nbsp; The institution of &#8220;Rocky Mountain High&#8221; was not without controversy, however.&nbsp; It seems some legislators were concerned that the song promoted drug use.&nbsp; The Rocky Mountain News <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/government/article/0,2777,DRMN_23906_5414146,00.html" title="chronicled some of the hijinks">chronicled some of the hijinks</a>:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Some Republicans raised concerns that the song could be a Siren&#8217;s call to getting stoned, because of the line, &#8216;Friends around the campfire and everybody&#8217;s high.&#8217;  In the House, Rep. Debbie Stafford, R-Aurora, unsuccessfully tried to amend the resolution to clarify that Rocky Mountain High &#8216;reflects Colorado&#8217;s high elevation and in no way reflects or encourages any drug abuse.&#8217;  This caused Rep. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood, to joke, &#8216;But it&#8217;s a &#8216;joint&#8217; resolution.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Oh, those quaint twentieth-century songwriters with their double entendres!&nbsp; Kind of makes you long for the days before &#8220;My Humps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Rocky&#8217;s hardworking music critic, Mark Brown, aroused the ire of the Piano Man with a review of his new song, &#8220;All My Life.&#8221;  Brown gave the disc a &#8220;D&#8221; grade, and wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/music/article/0,2792,DRMN_54_5380177,00.html" title="this incisive critique">this incisive critique</a>:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;This song would be uncomfortable enough just knowing it&#8217;s a love song written for Billy Joel&#8217;s wife, who happens to be just five years older than his daughter.&nbsp; Joel&#8217;s first &#8216;pop&#8217; single in 14 years finds him shamelessly aping Frank Sinatra (right down to the porkpie hat) while serenading a woman he married when she was 23 and he was 54. &#8216;Who could have known that finding you would only take me all my life?&#8217; he sings. Dude, she wasn&#8217;t alive for you to find for the first 31 years of your life! You were on the Glass Houses tour and eyeing Christie Brinkley when she was born.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Billy Joel actually got wind of the review and took the trouble to write <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/denver/letters/2007/03/billy_joel_takes_umbrage.html#more" title="a letter to the editor">a letter to the editor</a> that included this response: &#8220;Furthermore, since when does impersonating a music critic entitle Brown to be the moral arbiter of what constitutes a meaningful relationship?&nbsp; Creepiest song of 2007? Perhaps. Creepiest opinion of the year? Definitely.&#8221;  If that song wasn&#8217;t evidence enough that Joel&#8217;s career is hurting, his bothering to respond to a critique of it in a Denver paper is.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
It gets better--so far all of the online responses to Joel&#8217;s letter are pro-Joel, including one from a man who writes, &#8220;Mr. Brown, is jealous of you, Mr. Joel. There isn&#8217;t a man alive who wouldn&#8217;t like to have a wife better than half his age.&#8221;

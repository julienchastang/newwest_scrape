<b>Fishing in Last Light</b>
</p>
<p>
By <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/ronaldmcfarland" title="Ron McFarland">Ron McFarland</a>
</p>
<p>
Fishing in the dying light I notice
<br />
something is killing the white pines,
<br />
bark beetles probably,
<br />
and off to the west
<br />
Plum Creek Timber Company has drained
<br />
another mountainside.
<br />
Someday this stream will yield to silt,
<br />
and its trout will spill away or die
<br />
trying to stay against the odds.
</p>
<p>
A sudden splash from the far bank
<br />
draws me back to the moment.
<br />
As the air darkens
<br />
I search for something light,
<br />
dun, mothy, drained of color,
<br />
something I can see on the current,
<br />
a Light Cahill
<br />
riding high on the ripples.
<br />
The rainbow reads in ultra-violet,
<br />
finds color and light,
<br />
and strikes.
</p>
<p>
I used to fish with a neighbor
<br />
who lies now in a coma
<br />
hoping to die.
<br />
His eyes went fast,
<br />
and then his body began to lose itself.
<br />
His blood
<br />
ran in strange currents
<br />
against its own flow, surged wildly.
<br />
I watched his daughter take him out
<br />
on long walks late in the evening
<br />
when all the colors had run together.
</p>
<p>
We never got to know each other well.
<br />
When we attacked a stream
<br />
he would go one way and I another,
<br />
and at the end of the day we&#8217;d meet,
<br />
happy to have fished so well
<br />
alone together.
</p>
<p>
Two rainbows now lie in my creel,
<br />
clean and cool. 			
<br />
In the last light
<br />
an old fisherman comes around the bend.
<br />
He wears a bright red pork-pie hat		
<br />
bristling with trout flies:
<br />
Caddis, Grasshopper, Stonefly, Adams,
<br />
Coachman, Humpy, Renegade, Gnat.
</p>
<p>
Of course in the growing dark
<br />
I can only imagine the names
<br />
of those old feathery acquaintances.
<br />
The fisherman smiles and nods
<br />
like someone I&#8217;ve met before.

<b>New Year&#8217;s Eve</b>
</p>
<p>
By William Johnson
</p>
<p>
I was driving, the kids in back asleep
<br />
as you nodded beside me.
<br />
Fat flakes of snow floated down
<br />
out of the night and were swished away
<br />
by the wipers. I couldn&#8217;t see the river,
<br />
only feel it out there, urgent and black
<br />
beyond the road, its near edge
<br />
sealed by a lid of ice. Something
<br />
bolted through our lights and was gone,
<br />
the figment of a living 
<br />
thing, felt, yet barely visible, that lingered
<br />
in the back of my mind and
<br />
lunged on fierce through the drifts,
<br />
beast or its ghost receding, circling.
<br />
There is no end to our separateness&#8212;
<br />
what makes us love one another
<br />
is knowing how frail and lost we are.
<br />
At the cabin, each with a child bundled
<br />
in our arms, we climbed to the loft
<br />
and those rickety web-strewn cots.
<br />
Far in the night I woke to the sound
<br />
of snow falling, a soft tampering,
<br />
lovely, indescribable. Above each cot
<br />
a dim halo of breath rose in the cold,
<br />
hovered for a moment and was woven
<br />
with the others, then nothing if not gone.

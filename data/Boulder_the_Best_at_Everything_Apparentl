		<h1>Boulder the Best at Everything, Apparently</h1>

							A friend of mine recently moved from a nondescript Boulder condo to a lovely old house in nearby Louisville, and ever since then heâ€™s been talking up his new town and disparaging the old town.  He claims that people are friendlier in Louisvilleâ€”heâ€™s already met all of his neighbors, and one brought him a homemade cherry tart. Louisville people are more down-to-earth, he says, thereâ€™s less traffic and there are fewer annoying, idle rich tooling around on their expensive bicycles.  Sure, he admits, people arenâ€™t as beautiful in Louisville, but theyâ€™re much nicer to be around.  When <i>Money</i> magazine recently named Louisville the <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/best/bplive/" title="fifth best place in America to live">fifth best place in America to live</a>, he crowed.  But as far as best titles go, Boulder has the market cornered.  <br />
<br />
This year alone, the Denver-Boulder metro area was named the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/home/singles/2005/07/25/singles-best-cities_cx_05sing_0725land.html" title="Best City for Singles">Best City for Singles</a> by <i>Forbes</i> magazine, Boulder was listed at number six in <i>The 100 Best Art Towns in America</i> by critic John Villani, it came in 18th place in <i>American Style Magazine</i>â€™s Best Art Town City list, and the <i>Vegetarian Times</i> listed it among the â€œTop 20 Greenest Spots in the Country.â€?  The number of bests cited on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ci.boulder.co.us/comm/Public%20Affairs%20Internet/Best.htm" title="city of Boulder website">city of Boulder website</a> is truly staggering: over the past five years, Boulder has been praised by <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Menâ€™s Journal</i>, <i>Animal Wellness Magazine</i>, <i> Outside</i>, <i>Modern Maturity</i>, <i>Self</i>, and <i>Runnerâ€™s World</i>, among others.  According to these best lists that stretch back for over a decade, if youâ€™re a dog, a jogger, a runner, a hiker, a rock climber, a man, a woman, a child, a vegetarian, an elderly person, or single, Boulder is apparently the place to be.  Only out-of-shape, television watching, red-meat-eating, middle-aged ferret owners of indeterminate gender should move elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Boulder is indeed a wonderful place to live.  But does it really merit this lovefest, or is there a cabal of magazine writers colluding with Boulder realtors to keep the housing prices high?  Itâ€™s clear why <i>Money</i> magazine favored Louisville, and <i>Forbes</i> preferred Boulderâ€”<i>Money</i> caters to middle-class people who are looking for ways to stretch their salaries, and <i>Forbes</i> is targeted toward business executives, an audience that fits in well with the new Boulder.  <br />
<br />
Boulderâ€™s rapid evolution into a Front Range Aspen became clear to me when I was taking a look around the NoBo development one dayâ€”judging from all of all the Beamers parked everywhere, it was sort of place where a <i>Forbes</i>-reading single might buy a home.  The development was full of architecturally compelling modernist houses and beautiful people whose children were running around, dressed in designer clothesâ€”one little girl rolling in the grass was wearing a Lilly Pulitzer dress, which I recognized because I had recently stopped in front of a display of them at the mall and pondered just what sort of people dressed their toddlers so extravagantly.  I looked at a flyer for a two-bedroom condo that was selling for almost a half a million dollars and nearly choked.  A pimped-out S.U.V. rolled up next to me and the woman inside flashed me a toothpaste-commercial smile.  â€œAre you looking to buy?â€? she asked, and handed me her realtor business card.  Itâ€™s enough to make a person want to move to Louisville.

		<p>I was born and raised in Louisville colo.  I moved to Wa. state in 1990.  Louisville is not what it used to be.  It used to be the way your friend had described it.  It was seriously like mayberry.  Everybody knew everybody literally.  You never did anything you didn't want your parents to know about, because they would find out.  We had 2 spag. resturants, Collachis and the plue parrot, and a hometown resturant, Karens country kitchen.  When i returned for my fathers funeral in 97 i was completely lost with all the new roads and construction, not the mayberry town i had left.  So sad. And homes were so much more expensive.  i dont know how anyone can afford to live in Louisville anymore.</p>

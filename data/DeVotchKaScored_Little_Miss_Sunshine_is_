							Colorado's <a href="http://www.devotchka.net/" title="DeVotchKa">DeVotchKa</a> has been getting into the movie business in recent months (see <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/2995/" title=""DeVotchKa Makes Movie Music"">"DeVotchKa Makes Movie Music"</a>). The band recently composed the score for the film <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, an effort that took eight months, according to Robert Thomas of concert promoter Live Nation.  Thomas wrote in a press release that "the group adapted numerous songs from their critically acclaimed <i>How It Ends</i> and <i>Una Volta</i> full length records, provided new music for the score and collaborated with award winning composer Mychael Danna (<i>The Ice Storm</i>, <i>Capote</i>)."  The good news is that the film was well received at its Sundance Film Festival debut, and Fox Searchlight Films bought it for $10 million dollars, according to <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/01/park_city_06_bi_2.html" title="IndieWire.com">IndieWire.com</a>, which calls it "a major acquisition dealâ€”one of the largest in the history of the Sundance Film Festival." That means DeVotchKa's exuberant, surprising music will reach more listeners than ever when the film is released this summer.<br />
<br />
Local critics and music fans have been touting DeVotchKa since it released its first album, <a href="http://www.devotchka.net/buy.html" title="Supermelodrama">Supermelodrama</a>, in 2002.  The band has achieved greater national notice with each subsequent album, and it is planning to release an EP of cover songs in April. DeVotchKa, whose music is the quintessence of romance, will play its annual Valentine's Ball on Friday, February 10 at the <a href="http://www.bouldertheater.com/" title="Boulder Theater">Boulder Theater</a>.  Tickets are $15. <br />

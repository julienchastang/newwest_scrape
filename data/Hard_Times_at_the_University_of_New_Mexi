							<p>I once had a gig writing press releases for a Denver concert promoter.&nbsp; As the author of &#8220;John Tesh To Grace Red Rocks With His Magnetic Music,&#8221; I can attest that the press release is one of the least interesting genres to write and to read.&nbsp; It was to my great surprise, then, when I recently received a press release from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unmpress.com/" title="University of New Mexico Press">University of New Mexico Press</a> that was filled with suspense, drama, intrigue, and actual news.
</p>
<p>
The word from Albuquerque was this: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Despite months of budget-cutting and assurances from upper management that jobs were not in jeopardy, employees of UNM Press were left stunned yesterday by announcements of layoffs and possible outsourcing of their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Two employees, Glenda Madden, marketing and sales manager for the press for seven years and a thirty-three-year university press publishing veteran, and Lisa Pacheco, a junior acquisitions editor, were told April 30 would be their last day at the press. The press&#8217;s publicity department was also told to cut one job from its two-person staff, the result of which is pending&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Press publicist Amanda Sutton, an eight-year publishing professional who has been with the press for five years, was called by Richard Schuetz to a meeting with Luther Wilson, press director, mid-morning on Monday. Mr. Wilson, after citing the recession and the press&#8217;s operating deficit, asked Ms. Sutton to decide whether she would remain on staff or whether her assistant of three years, Katherine MacGilvray, would be let go.
</p>
<p>
&#8216;I have a difficult time determining the fate of a fellow colleague, to whom I owe much loyalty and respect. Sacrificing up a colleague is not part of my job description,&#8217; says Ms. Sutton.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://chronicle.com/news/article/6232/employees-revolt-over-layoffs-at-the-u-of-new-mexico-press" title="The Chronicle of Higher Education">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> followed up with Wynn Goering, the University of New Mexico&#8217;s vice provost for academic affairs:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;&#8216;UNM Press has been hard hit by the recession,&#8217; [Goering] said, with a projected operating deficit of $690,000 by June 30. &#8216;Given the magnitude of the problems, we simply didn&#8217;t see any way forward without restructuring the business model and reducing its work force.&#8217; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/msgget.jsp?mid=2777823" title="Shelf Awareness">Shelf Awareness</a>)
</p>
<p>
Do you hear that?&nbsp; That&#8217;s the sound of me shaking my fist at this darn recession.&nbsp; If only my fist were mightier.&nbsp; The University of New Mexico Press publishes a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/otero_mesa_captures_the_rugged_beauty_of_the_new_mexico_grassland/C39/L39/" title="great">great</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/colorado_abstract_showcases_states_contemporary_artists/C39/L39/" title="books">books</a>, and I sure hope they sort all this out.
</p>
<p>
While I&#8217;m at it, why don&#8217;t I dish up some even more disturbing news. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bendweekly.com/Statewide-News/17287.html" title="Bend Weekly">Bend Weekly</a> reported:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A published children&#8217;s author from Portland has been charged with a variety of child pornography offenses. Kevin Patrick Bath, 50, who writes under the name K.P. Bath, was arraigned Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court on an indictment charging him with one count each of distributing, transferring, and receiving child pornography, and two counts of possessing child pornography. He entered pleas of not guilty to each count. Trial is set for June 9, 2009, before U.S. District Judge Ancer L. Haggerty.&#8221; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/" title="Publishers Lunch">Publishers Lunch</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/publisher_says_it_wont_print_b.html" title="The Oregonian">The Oregonian</a> reported that Bath&#8217;s publisher, Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, has decided not to publish his next book. (Duh.)
</p>
<p>
On a brighter note, the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://eventful.com/denver/events/denver-public-library-2009-evil-companions-literary-/E0-001-020343205-4" title="Evil Companions Literary Award">Evil Companions Literary Award</a>, sponsored by the Tattered Cover and the Denver Public Library, will honor Timothy Egan this year, for his award-winning book <I>The Worst Hard Time</I>&#8230;about the Great Depression.&nbsp; (The party is at The Oxford Hotel on April 16, 6 p.m., and tickets are $65-$150, with a &#8220;Hard Times&#8221; ticket rate of $50 for students and educators.)
</p>
<p>
Isn&#8217;t there anything good that&#8217;s happened lately?&nbsp; Well, maybe one thing.&nbsp; The folks at the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2009/03/brad-watson-in-new-yorker.html" title="Wyoming Arts Blog">Wyoming Arts Blog</a> pointed out that Brad Watson had a story published in The New Yorker.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.wyomingauthors.org/Brad+Watson" title="Brad Watson">Brad Watson</a> is a writing professor at the University of Wyoming, and his story &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2009/04/06/090406fi_fiction_watson" title="Visitation">Visitation</a>&#8221; appeared in the April 6 issue.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t get much better than that.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The story itself is the sad and poignant tale of a man who travels to San Diego to visit his young son, who is in the custody of his estranged wife.&nbsp; It begins: &#8220;Loomis had never believed that line about the quality of despair being that it was unaware of being despair. He&#8217;d been painfully aware of his own despair for most of his life.&#8221;  I suppose this sends a useful message: when times are tough, go and make art out of your misery.

		<b>Comment By Bill Croke, 4-15-09</b>
		<p>Jenny, If the university presses are in trouble (and I'm sure UNM isn't alone) it's mainly because academically-oriented books don't sell. Academics read academics, but there is no widely dispersed audience. Said presses are usually a reflection of the institutions themselves, and are captive of the prevailing multicultural pathologies found on campus. They can blame the recession all they want. And I think the big New York houses are seeing the same thing. If you publish garbage, it's garbage. Everybody "writes" today, from alienated academics who hate their jobs, to Paris Hilton, who is a brand. 99% of  books published annually in America aren't worth reading, they're merely an extension of the pop culture. Remember Pamela Anderson pushing a book somebody ghosted for her on Letterman, and she didn't know who Ernest Hemingway was. That's a perfect metaphor for our Republic of Letters. Oddly enough, conservative houses like Regnery are doing well: Ann Coulter, Mark Levin, et al. But they don't get reviewed in the liberal media, such as the New York Times. Bottom line: University Presses, RIP. But who reads them?</p>

<br />
Sorry, gotta say that, if you're doing it right, this just isn't the case...</p>
		
		<b>Comment By mbartley, 4-16-09</b>
		<p>Who reads them Bill? I do. I am a voracious reader of fiction and non-fiction. The American West is my particular obsession but I try and remain open to a broad range of reading. I could not disagree with you more fully. The University presses publish some of the finer works I have ever encountered. In our region alone we have a number of fine U publishers including two of exceptional merit, the presses of Nebraska and Oklahoma. The loss of these "alternative" publishers would be a bitter blow to our culture. Our stories are who we are. We need more not less.<br />
Also, Jenny, I was able to attend Steve Rinella's talk here in the Fort. He is a young writer with talent to burn and a man comfortable with complexity and careful in his assertions. What a joy to listen to someone who does not settle for the easy answer while doling out pablum. He spoke on a subject I know a bit about and I was impressed with his thoughtful articulate views on buffalo, people, and the land.<br />

		<p>M.Bartley,  The loss of the "alternative"  university presses would be a "bitter blow to our culture" if they were indeed the least bit heterodox. But they're not. They are merely our own regional reflection of the whole of contemporary American "culture", which is elitist, politically correct, and "progressive". Not only that, they put out most of the bad writing found at your local Barnes and Noble. Much of what Jenny reviews --almost daily, she is prolific--reflects this. The university presses mostly put out books reflecting the "struggles" of "oppressed" folks: Native Americans, Hispanics, and western women kept down by the patriarchy, etc. Patty Limerick, Mary Clearman Blew, Kim Barnes,John Clayton, Judy Blunt. I've always thought William Kittredge was a regional "academic hack" in the Gore Vidal sense. Terry Tempest Williams and Gretel Ehrlich, though they have national audiences. Same with Rick Bass, which reminds me that much contemporary western literature is green-driven; it's always a flaw in a writer's artistic integrity to let a political agenda drive their art, so to speak. I would think MFA programs across the West are loaded with Bass imitators. Thomas McGuane has been writing the same novel over and over for thirty years. Larry McMurtry lives in Texas, which is the South, not the West. He co-authors real horse operas now. Cormac McCarthy had integrity and then discovered Oprah's Book Club. Edward Abbey and Tony Hillerman are dead (RIP). That's about it. A few random thoughts. Bottom line, Bartley: it's mostly a wasteland out there. Try Tolstoy and the rest of the dead white guys.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-20-09</b>
		<p>Wow, Bill.  I feel like I should respond, but I'm not sure how with all that you said!  I enjoy the work of a lot of the writers you named, and I'm not sure what your point is about university presses, because several of them publish with major publishers--Kim Barnes, Judy Blunt, Terry Tempest Williams, and Rick Bass.<br />
<br />
I thought Mary Clearman Blew's novel "Jackalope Dreams" was a great book, and a good example of the kind of work published by a university press (in this case, my favorite one, the University of Nebraska Press) that otherwise might fall through the cracks.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newwest.net%2Ftopic%2Farticle%2Fold_and_new_montana_clash_in_accomplished_jackalope_dreams%2FC39%2FL39%2F">http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/old_and_new_montana_clash_in_accomplished_jackalope_dreams/C39/L39/</a><br />
<br />
I agree that Tolstoy is wonderful, Bill, but the question is, who else do you like to read?  Anybody alive?<br />
<br />
(Not that there's anything wrong with your reading preferences.  I have a friend that will only read coming-of-age novels about males in contemporary America.  At least he reads!)</p>
		
		<b>Comment By mbartley, 4-20-09</b>
		<p>Bill, a green driven wasteland is what you see when you survey the literary west. I don't. Nothing much more to say about it. When two people disagree to the core, it is hard to know where to go with the discussion. Let me try. I've read the dead Russians. Should I stop reading now? Everything else is just drivel? Also, could you explain to me how the Russians managed to maintain their artistic integrity in the face of their own political agendas? I read a lot of white guys, Stegner and Harrison to name just two not yet in our discussion. I also read a lot of work by folks of deeper shades of color some of whom, and I know this is shocking, come without a penis. Folks such as Welch, Baca, Erdrich and Proulx, again just to name a few, are among my favorites. Perhaps, we can agree that nearly all writers have some sort of political point of view or agenda. Certainly, we can agree that we prefer writers and stories that share or confirm our world view. Maybe, we can take the next step and try and read works that may shatter our preconceived notions about ourselves and our world. Slumped against an old busted cottonwood staring at the page in wonderment at notions beyond my own precious meanderings is my idea of a fine way to whittle away an evening. I like Turgenev but, tonight I think I'll finish Louise Erdrich's novel The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse. So far I've encountered an old priest with a womans plumbing. Well, this should be interesting. I hope it's not a wasteland.<br />

		<p>Jenny, Sorry, I'm just a curmudgeon. I'm rereading more and more old friends from the classics. The new administration has got me on what you might call a political cautionary tale kick lately. Orwell's "1984" and just last night the first 35 pages of "Animal Farm". A couple of weeks ago Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon", returning to it after 20 years. The best novel ever as a meditation on the totalitarian mind. I also like staight history and this past winter read Walter Isaacson's biography of Ben Franklin. Also a dusty old thing found at the public library: Thomas Costain's "The White and the Gold", a history of New France. The older I get I just want to be fascinated and amused.I've long ago got over the notion that I need to read a particular book because everybody else is.  I write about the West (journalism, reviews, etc. in the conservative press,though as you know reviewing is dying everywhere, for money anyway) and I've reviewed many of those writers I've mentioned in the previous post. The literature of the contemporary West takes itself too seriously. It comes with the territory. But most writers in, say, Montana (to name a state whose literati have pretensions as big as the,well, Big Sky), are no better than most writers in Indiana or Pennsylvania. They just have a nicer view from the front porch. Oh, and if most of the writers I named are not with university presses but New York publishers, well, good for them, but that future isn't bright either.</p>

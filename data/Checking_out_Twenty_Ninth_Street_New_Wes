							After years of public debate over the fate of the old Crossroads Mall and its subsequent demolition, its replacement, <a target="_blank" href="ttp://www.twentyninth.com" title="Twenty Ninth Street">Twenty Ninth Street</a>, finally opened October 12.  I scouted it out last week, and I haven't made my mind up about it yet--it's certainly good that Boulderites won't have to head to Broomfield whenever they need to buy a pair of pants, but it doesn't look like there are enough stores yet to obviate trips down US-36 for most people.<br />
<br />
<b>The Design</b><br />
Overall, Twenty Ninth Street is aesthetically pleasing, featuring sweeping wooden beams, flagstone facades, and industrial elements that have turned up in other recent area malls, such as FlatIron Crossing and Park Meadows.  The difference is that Twenty Ninth Street's stores are all accessed outdoors, a feature its developers say Boulderites asked for.  It remains to be seen though, whether this duplication of the amenities offered at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall will work, and where people will choose to shop during the colder months.  <br />
<br />
The gimmick behind the mall's name--a street that runs through the stores--doesn't immediately appeal.  It allows vehicle traffic to pass through the center of the mall so that pedestrians have to take care when they cross.  Because I was pushing a baby stroller, I also noticed that its handicap accessibility is a little lacking.  There are lots of areas where ramps are missing, and only stairs are present to get from one level to another as you walk down the same side of the street.  There are ways around it if you search them out, but stroller-pushing parents and the wheelchair bound won't be able to walk in a straight line down the rows of shops.<br />
 <br />
<b>The Shoppers</b><br />
I went on a Wednesday afternoon and found that the two key groups to any mall's success were already present: mallrats and stroller-pushing mamas, many of whom moved in phalanxes three abreast across the sidewalk.  The mallrats were a touching sight.  Seeing these teens loafing around during the first week the mall was open made me think of the hardships Boulder's mallrat population endured during the years between the shuttering of the Crossroads Mall and the opening of Twenty Ninth Street.  How did those too young to drive endure it? Prarie dogs reign in Boulder while mallrats are left to fend for themselves.<br />
<br />
When I visited again on late Saturday afternoon, most of the stores were fairly empty--just how many people can possible want to stock up on candles at any given moment at the Yankee Candle Company, anyway?  But the Apple Store was an exception.<br />
<br />
<b>The Stores</b><br />
The Apple Store is clearly the crown jewel of Twenty Ninth Street, with its simple icon glowing from on high like a beacon.  Apparently, this was the store that Boulderites most requested in surveys, and they thronged to it this Saturday.  The store was packed with people of every age, and I was struck by how plainly happy everyone inside seemed to be. <br />
<br />
Kids and teens were wearing headphones, listening to music at the iPod stations.  One girl of about ten years old was standing with her legs spread wide so that her face was exactly at the level of a red iPod that was attached to the table, and she was peering into it as if it were going to reveal the mysteries of life, chewing her gum in concentration.  <br />
<br />
Joyful soul and Motown music played just loudly enough to give the place a party vibe (Barry White's "Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Baby," for example), and middle-aged folks spread their palms out on the tables before the Mac displays, studying the hardware.  At the back of the store stood a "Genius Bar," where people could wait to talk to a Mac expert and see their names flashed out to the crowd on an overhead monitor.  At around 6 p.m., the monitor said that the next available consultation would be at 7:20 p.m.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the only other store that seemed to be as lively was Muttropolis, a pet accessory supplier advertising its organizations services of meet-ups for dogs of the same breed, which made me wonder if dogs care at all whether they socialize with others of their same breed or not.  Somehow I doubt it.  My husband remarked that there was no decent place for him to buy a pair of pants, and it's true that Twenty Ninth Street's clothing options lean heavily toward the female consumer.  So I guess that means no rest for weary Boulder men forced to head to Broomfield for their pants.<br />

		<p>We had dinner at California Pizza Kitchen last  night, and it's clear that Boulderites have also been starved for gourmet chi-chi Thai chicken pies. The place was packed, and when we left there were about a dozen folks waiting to be seated.</p>

	Looking out the window each day at peaceful American streets, it&#8217;s difficult for many of us to tell that our country is at war.&nbsp; But the characters in Missoula writer Phil Condon&#8217;s sharply-written new story collection, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nine-Ten-Again-Phil-Condon/dp/1932418334" title="Nine Ten Again">Nine Ten Again</a></i>, are all too aware of the far-away wars that the U.S. has participated in over the past few decades, which have affected them in ways both tangible and intangible.&nbsp; Yellow ribbons appear throughout the book not as symbols of hope but as symptoms of malignancy, signs of the wars that rob people of their lives, mental health, self-respect, and peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
Most of Condon&#8217;s characters work blue-collar jobs, and so they are not as insulated from war as are those with more money.&nbsp; They are veterans too scarred by their service to hold down a job, or people desperate enough for money to contemplate signing up for a hitch as contractors in the Middle East.&nbsp; As a character in the title story says, &#8220;She ain&#8217;t ever gonna be 9-10 again, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Condon, who teaches in the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cas.umt.edu/evst/faculty_condon.htm" title=" Environmental Studies Program at the University of Montana"> Environmental Studies Program at the University of Montana</a>, frequently evokes his characters&#8217; connection to or disconnection from the landscape. His stories are set all over the interior of country, including Montana, Colorado, Nebraska, Illinois, and Kansas. 
<br />
 
<br />
In the title story, Clint Mulane is a down-on-his-luck truck driver.&nbsp; He can&#8217;t find a decent job where he wants to live, out in the countryside, and his wife and child have left him to move into town.&nbsp; He&#8217;s tempted when a local know-it-all named Rex who has worked on offshore rigs claims that a company will be coming through to hire people to work in Qatar.&nbsp; &#8220;My contact says they&#8217;re due to need oil men, carpenters, drivers, you name it.&nbsp; You get room, board, and expenses.&nbsp; Plus a fat nest egg when you finish up.&#8221;  But as with most of Condon&#8217;s protagonists, things don&#8217;t go the way Clint plans.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The White Beast,&#8221; on the other hand, features a man enjoying a good life who is nearly undone by the appearance of an opossum in his house.&nbsp; Roy has safely returned from a drive in a rainstorm and parked his Porsche in the garage.&nbsp; His kids and wife are away visiting her parents in New York City, and he sits down to have some wine and contemplate his life.&nbsp; &#8220;Oak furniture, rock fireplace, redwood deck through the window, and then the common woods stretching down and away from the backyard.&nbsp; Hell, he was fine.&nbsp; He was doing all right for himself.&nbsp; Better than all right.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Roy steps out of the shower and discovers an opossum in his hallway.&nbsp; The animal opens &#8220;its jaws&#8221; and hisses.&nbsp; Roy tries to reassert his control of the situation, but when the power goes out, he&#8217;s reduced to hysterics.&nbsp; The opossum seems to represent the fear of the unknown malign occurrence that could snatch Roy&#8217;s settled happiness from him at any moment, a mysterious representative from nature who comes to remind Roy of how little is really in his control.&nbsp; In many of the other stories in <I>Nine Ten Again</I>, the dreaded thing occurs, but in &#8220;The White Beast&#8221; Roy is left safe, fearing what might happen.
</p>
<p>
On the other end of the economic spectrum, a bricklayer named Duck Brinweiser in the story &#8220;Cakewalk&#8221; witnesses a murder and he must participate in its cover-up to preserve his desperately needed job.&nbsp; &#8220;Duck and Mona had two kids, Donnie and Sue, seven and ten,&#8221; Condon writes, &#8220;and every bill that came with them.&#8221;  In &#8220;A Silver Cloud,&#8221; a single mother named Penny also has to endure degradation in silence because she can&#8217;t afford to lose her job.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In the background of these stories of day-to-day desperation, history progresses, filtering in through news reports and idle office chitchat.&nbsp; One of Penny&#8217;s coworkers holds up a newspaper whose headline announces the fall of Baghdad.&nbsp; &#8220;Only three weeks,&#8221; he crows, &#8220;It&#8217;s a great day for the U.S. of A.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
While the conflicts overseas lend an atmosphere of vague unease to many of the stories, for the protagonist of &#8220;A Country Voice,&#8221; war takes center stage every day.&nbsp; A damaged Vietnam Veteran, Chad spends his time working in the garage or doing landscaping for his neighbors while his anger and mental illness builds to a boiling point.&nbsp; &#8220;The VA people can&#8217;t hear me,&#8221; he thinks, &#8220;they&#8217;re clones from the central office.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve been body-snatched and mind-washed, with buttons for balls.&nbsp; I can tell by the way they sit.&nbsp; Charlie at the desk, answering the phone, filling out the forms.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I get the treatment I get.&nbsp; They like to start wars, but not to finish them.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a finisher, a lifer on duty at the homefront, and it makes their skin crawl.&nbsp; They call me a syndrome and mail me monthly checks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The stories in <i>Nine Ten Again</i> are geographically diverse, and the characters they feature are distinct from one another, but taken together they present a striking portrait of the different ways contemporary Americans relate to the faraway wars their country wages, and how the country&#8217;s angst mirrors their personal anxieties, anger, and troubles.

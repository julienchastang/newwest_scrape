</p>
<p>
	One summer when I was a kid, I went through a horse book faze, reading all the Maguerite Henry books I could find in the library, books such as <I>Misty of Chincoteague</I> and <I>Stormy, Misty&#8217;s Foal</I>, anything that had a portrait of the starring animal looking bright-eyed and spirited on the cover.&nbsp; Aryn Kyle&#8217;s debut novel, <I>The God of Animals</I>, will be of special interest to anyone who used to devour horse books, because it shows the flip side of the world portrayed in those somewhat idealized young adult novels.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
While Kyle does take time to admire the beauty of horses now and then, her focus in this accomplished book is more on the constant mucking out of stalls, the dashed hopes of a rancher trying to make ends meet, and the blunt rituals of the horse world, from hobbling a mare so that a stud can impregnate her, to the forced separation of mewling foals from their mothers, to the bloody accidents that can occur in the riding ring.
</p>
<p>
	Kyle grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado, earned her MFA from the University of Montana writing program, and currently lives in Missoula.&nbsp; She sets <I>The God of Animals</I> in the fictional Desert Valley, Colorado, a small town with a working-class and upper-middle-class divide that appears to be based on Grand Junction.&nbsp; <I>The God of Animals</I> is narrated by twelve-year-old Alice Winston, who explains in the opening line, &#8220;Six months before Polly Cain drowned in the canal, my sister, Nona, ran off and married a cowboy.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Alice lives on a ranch with her father, Joe, who trains horses and teaches students to ride and show.&nbsp; The girl&#8217;s mother took to her bed with what appears to be a raging case of post-partum depression shortly after Alice was born, and only rarely makes an appearance outside her bedroom.&nbsp; Nona was the golden child of the family, winning horse competitions and attracting business for her father.&nbsp; Alice doesn&#8217;t show horses, and leads a lonely existence, ruminating about the death of her classmate Polly, more an acquaintance than friend, and doing the constant work that a horse ranch requires.&nbsp; Her father&#8217;s only current student, when the book opens, is a rather unpromising horse-besotted rich girl named Sheila Altman.&nbsp; As the Winston family finances continue to founder, Alice outgrows her clothes and nobody notices.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Joe is forced to start boarding horses, a line of business that he considers beneath him.&nbsp; This brings in a gaggle of women from the wealthy-side of town who groom their horses, gossip, and drink champagne from paper cups, women Alice thinks of as &#8220;the Catfish,&#8221; and whom her father describes as &#8220;the kind of women who turn to horses when they&#8217;re finished with men.&#8221;  As the stable gets busier, the Winstons become more involved with the complicated lives of the people whose horses they care for, entanglements that spark and build to the book&#8217;s conclusion.
</p>
<p>
Kyle has done an artful, careful job with <I>The God of Animals</I>, packing it with riveting details and insights. There&#8217;s this description of a community function that Alice has to attend, for example, which conjures up her entire world in a few quick sentences:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;My father said I had to wear a dress to the posse banquet, which put us at odds for the entire day.&nbsp; <I>Banquet</I> was a loose term for the party that the sheriff&#8217;s posse threw each summer.&nbsp; A potluck, people showed up in pickup trucks, carrying dishes of greasy food covered with cellophane and wearing cowboy boots so that they could dance in the arena without worrying about horse droppings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The inexperienced Sheila Altman, the epitome of a peppy, horse-struck girl with golden braids, asks Sheila questions that allow her to explain the mysteries of the horse business to the reader as well.&nbsp; Alice knows horses, but she&#8217;s seeking the answers to mysteries of her own, such as what goes on between adults, what makes them fight, fall in love, fail, and go crazy.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Kyle is deft at portraying the way an adolescent makes sense of the world, by adding up the information gleaned from glimpses caught through chinks and voices heard through thin walls, such as in this moment when Alice sees her father, in a foot cast from an injury, talking to one of the women who stables her horse at the ranch: &#8220;Through the crack of the stall door, I watched Patty Jo&#8217;s foot slide forward, the glossy triangular toe of her boot stopping just before it met the grubby heel of my father&#8217;s cast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The mood of <I>The God of Animals</I> matches the stifling heat of the drought summer in which much of the book takes place.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a feeling that the people in this book are as restive as the wild, unbroken Pinto mare, Darling, that Joe Winston buys, waiting for their opportunity to break out from the strictures imposed on them by marriage, poverty, community ties, and social mores.&nbsp; The novel follows the classic coming-of-age formula, but this is material that never gets old when the writer who works it as capable as Aryn Kyle.&nbsp; Like Nona Winston riding her horse, Aryn Kyle appears to be a natural.

I work in a private residential treatment center who has a very powerful Equine program.  Please give me some background on how I could use this wonderful book in my classroom in this type of environment?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Suzanne Walcott, 6-06-07</b>
		<p>I would like these comments to reach Aryn Kyle<br />
<br />
I hated the book! It was so cruel and awful... I am an animal lover and do animal communication. I couldn't believe the intolerable conditions those horses lived under, and the terrible things that were done to them. They obviously, were a business, nothing else. <br />
<br />
The only likable character in the whole book was Jerry, who was very wise and really liked the animals, and to some extent, Patty Jo. The grandparents were fairly likable as well. I really didn't get the mother, and her self absorption and secluding herself upstairs in her bedroom. I couldn't believe the acti<br />
ons of Alice and her father - so completely sadistic! And I never understood what happened to Nona, to change her to a bitter, non caring person.<br />
<br />
While I was reading it, I actually dreaded picking it up to continue. It filled me with such despair and fear... and the anticipation of some new horror within.<br />
<br />
So if THAT's what you wanted to portray, you succeeded... I do hope there are other ranchers and breeders out there with a little more empathy and kindness. You DON'T break horses, you come to an accord with them, I know it can be done because I have seen it.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />

		<p>Hi Suzanne,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing your views on this book.  It sounds like it certainly riled you up, which in a way is a compliment to the author.  It sounds like you were compelled enough by it to finish the book, too.  I did find several characters in the book to be unsympathetic--like you, I thought Nona and the mother were self-absorbed.  But I think if everybody behaved nicely all of the time, there wouldn't be much of a plot.<br />
<br />
I also think this book achieves what I feel to be one of the most important goals with writing--it feels true.  Not to mention that a lot of the writing is just beautiful.  And even though some of the characters do ugly things, Kyle isn't advocating what they do, she's just showing that in the world, these things happen.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for lending your voice to the conversation on this--I interviewed T.C. Boyle a few months ago, and he said he wished that when he was at a party, he could discuss books with people instead of TV or movies, but that most people he meets don't have a book in common that they've all read.  So in a way, a blog like this is a good chance for people who have a book in common to discuss it, whether they disagree or not.<br />
<br />

		<p>One of the best books I've read in a long time!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Pat, 7-14-09</b>
		<p>I am from Grand Junction, reading this book I recognize many of the people as I showed horses for many years. Anyone who reads this book should realize four things; one it is base loosely on actual people, two one of the main characters is not respected by many so do not take their practices as acceptable or common in the horse world at large, and three the author is a young girl who wanted to be a horse person but never got the opportunity to really experience horse behavior which she herself states in an interview when she says she lived in a subdivision with her parents and a dog she played with horses for a few years as a hobby I would guess she did not fully understand everything she saw around her. Fourth and not least it is a STORY added to changed and told in a fiction book not everything in it happened ever.<br />
<br />
To Jan brown above; don't use a fictional book in your classroom use something backed up by fact, research or at least written for the purpose of being used in an equine program, try Colorado State University they have an equine therapy program.</p>

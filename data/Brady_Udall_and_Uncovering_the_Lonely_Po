							<p><I>Boise&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://bradyudall.com" title="Brady Udall">Brady Udall</a> is the author of the 1997 short story collection </I>Letting Loose the Hounds<I> and two novels, 2001&#8217;s </I>The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint<I> and the new </I>The Lonely Polygamist<I>.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re looking for a big, funny, moving novel to read this spring, look no farther.&nbsp; </I>The Lonely Polygamist<I> is my favorite novel this year so far, and I&#8217;ve been telling everybody about it, so don&#8217;t say that I didn&#8217;t tell you.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the story of Golden Richards, a stressed-out husband to four wives and father of 28 children, living in a polygamist community in Utah and commuting to Nevada to oversee the construction of a brothel, which he tells his wives is a senior center.&nbsp; Richards is struggling to make enough money to support his family, survive the political squabbles between his wives, and to resist succumbing to the temptations of his boss&#8217;s lovely wife.&nbsp; I spoke to Udall about how the novel grew out of research he did for an Esquire article, his polygamist great-great-grandfather, how growing up in a family of nine kids helped him write about this large family, and how humor is &#8220;the most important thing.&#8221;  Udall will be <a target="_blank" href="http://bradyudall.com/BradyUdallReadings.php" title="touring throughout the West">touring throughout the West</a> for the next two months, with stops in Boise (tonight, May 3, Rediscovered Bookstore, 7 p.m., and May 10, Barnes &amp; Noble, 7 p.m.), Salt Lake City (May 4, King&#8217;s English, 7 p.m.), Denver (May 5, Tattered Cover, 7 p.m.), Santa Fe (June 7, Collected Works, 6 p.m.), and two-dozen other cities.</I>

<b>New West: How did <a target="_blank" href="http://www.standard.net/topics/features/2010/04/19/brady-udalls-1998-esquire-article-lonely-polygamist" title=""The Lonely Polygamist" article">&#8220;The Lonely Polygamist&#8221; article</a> that you wrote for Esquire in 1998 come about&#8212;did you suggest it or was it assigned?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Brady Udall:</b>  They came to me.&nbsp; They knew that I&#8217;d been raised Mormon, and for some reason they were interested in religion and religious writers.&nbsp; Rick Moody had written a piece about prayer and they liked that.&nbsp; So they wanted me to write something about my religious background.&nbsp; It made sense for me to write about polygamy, because I come from polygamy.&nbsp; My great-great grandfather was a polygamist, and his second wife was my great-great grandmother.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you ever talk to your family about that?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  A little bit.&nbsp; It was not talked about a lot, let&#8217;s put it that way.&nbsp; I always got the feeling when you brought up the subject that it was better left unsaid.&nbsp; So it just made us all the more curious.&nbsp; For a time, my family lived in the old Udall home, which my polygamist great-great grandfather built, a big house with ten bedrooms.&nbsp; So we had a sense of what the whole thing meant just from living in that giant house.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you find your subject for the article, whom you give the pseudonym &#8220;Bill&#8221;?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  I got lucky.&nbsp; I have a friend who is a wonderful writer and writes about polygamy.&nbsp; And I just called her up and said, &#8220;Do you know anybody I could talk to?&#8221;  She gave me some names, and I still remember very well that she said, &#8220;I trust you.&#8221;  What she was telling me was, don&#8217;t make fun of these people, and don&#8217;t make light of these people.&nbsp; Give them the benefit of the doubt as you&#8217;d give anybody else the benefit of the doubt.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW:&nbsp; That&#8217;s exactly what I wrote in my review of <I>The Lonely Polygamist</I> for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/vitindex.html" title="Dallas Morning News">Dallas Morning News</a>&#8212;you give your characters the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Golden&#8217;s wives are adults, and they have understandable motivations for entering willingly into this polygamist family.&nbsp; No one abuses the kids or marries the girls off to old men.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  To me that&#8217;s important.&nbsp; There are polygamist communities where there&#8217;s all that stuff you&#8217;re talking about, but there are polygamist communities where there&#8217;s none of that stuff.&nbsp; So to paint them all with the same brush seems particularly unfair to me.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Are there any similarities between Bill and Golden?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  The fictional family I created is very different, and Golden is very different from Bill.&nbsp; But there are similarities, and the most important one for me is that these are normal people.&nbsp; I met several families in the course of my research and they seemed terribly normal other than the fact that they were in a family with four wives, one husband, and 30 or 35 kids.&nbsp; That to me was really interesting, because what it meant was that I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be writing about strangeness and oddity, but about real people living in a kind of outsize or excessive way.&nbsp; I think a polygamist family, in lots of ways, is kind of the quintessentially American family.&nbsp; They&#8217;re just overly ambitious and large and complicated.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t seem that weird to me, at least for this country.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: In some ways you&#8217;ve taken a common subject for an American novel, a man who is buckling under the stresses of supporting his family, and is tempted by another woman, and you&#8217;ve made it fresh by blowing up to the grandest possible scale.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  And that&#8217;s exactly what I was trying to do.&nbsp; I was trying to write the ultimate family novel.&nbsp; This seemed like a great way to do it, because I come from a really big family.&nbsp; I&#8217;m one of nine children.&nbsp; Both my parents are one of seven or eight children, and it&#8217;s one of those small Western towns.&nbsp; My great-great grandfather founded the town that I grew up in with my family, St. Johns, Arizona.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You dedicated the book to your brothers and sisters.&nbsp; In what ways did growing up in a family of nine inform your take on Golden&#8217;s home life?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  Well, it informed it a lot.&nbsp; I think a lot of people would approach writing about this sort of family situation with uncertainty, but it felt pretty natural to me to write about a family with all these kids running around and this kind of chaos.&nbsp; I felt that I knew what it was like to be both an adult and a child in that situation.&nbsp; I have four kids myself, which doesn&#8217;t quite match 28 kids, but I&#8217;ve been around large families a lot.&nbsp; That part of it came pretty easily to me.&nbsp; It was much more difficult to figure out the politics and the difficulties among the wives.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: My mom grew up in a family of nine, too, and it seems like everyone came away with a slightly different perspective on it, depending on his or her place in the birth order.&nbsp; I think some felt they wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way, while others felt like they could have used more attention.&nbsp; You seemed to show that in shifting perspective of your narrative&#8212;you show each person as they see themselves, and how they fit into the big organism of the family.&nbsp; That must have been tricky to do.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  It is.&nbsp; I&#8217;m only coming from my experience.&nbsp; My experience growing up in a big family is that I felt isolated.&nbsp; You would think that being among all these people, you&#8217;d feel protected and intimate, but I felt like I was on my own.&nbsp; Not only did I not get much attention, I didn&#8217;t feel like I had real connections with my family.&nbsp; And I love my family.&nbsp; It might sound odd to put it that way, but I really felt like I was on my own.&nbsp; That tends to happen in large groups like that&#8212;if you can&#8217;t find a cohort or a comrade or two, you&#8217;re on your own.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Did you feel like the character Rusty does in the book?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  Yeah.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not real happy to admit it, but there&#8217;s some definite autobiographical stuff in Rusty&#8217;s depiction.&nbsp; Rusty is the kid I could have been if things had not gone well for me in the way they don&#8217;t go well for him.&nbsp; It&#8217;s easy to look at him as just this whacked-out little kid, but I think of him as this fairly normal kid who&#8217;s just dying for some attention and love, and he just doesn&#8217;t get it.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Rusty is great.&nbsp; So funny.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  When I was writing him, I always felt really happy and comfortable, even though he&#8217;s a little jerk.&nbsp; In literature, the children tend to be wise-beyond-their-years or they tend to be innocent, or we idealize them.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to do that with this character.&nbsp; I wanted to make him as real as possible.&nbsp; There are kids like this all over the place.&nbsp; They&#8217;re kind of full of it and they drive you crazy, but there&#8217;s still some sweetness and innocence in them.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Rusty was so his age, thinking that spending time with his aunt Trish was &#8220;as good as it could possibly get, better than cherry popsicles on a yacht with Wonder Woman.&#8221;  I loved that line.&nbsp; It must have been tricky in a novel with so many characters to figure out what perspective to use, and you decided to focus mainly on the perspectives of Golden, Trish, and Rusty.&nbsp; How did you figure that out?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b> I knew with a family this big, I couldn&#8217;t do it from just one point of view, so it seemed almost automatic to do it from the perspectives of the husband, one of the wives, and one of the children.&nbsp; But beyond that, it became very difficult.&nbsp; I found that even though I was writing from these three points of view, it still wasn&#8217;t giving the full sense of such a large family.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t believe that it was impossible to do that even with three points of view.&nbsp; So I had to introduce this omniscient point of view where the reader gets to see the entire family as this one large organism or group.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why, but that really helped me figure it all out.&nbsp; I probably wrote three quarters of the novel without doing that, and I felt sometimes claustrophobic with some of the characters and how they were seeing things, but getting that larger perspective really helped me.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: When you were writing it, did you trade off between the perspectives, or did you write Golden&#8217;s whole story and then switch to Trish?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  I just traded off.&nbsp; What happens when you&#8217;re a writer is that you read a book and it&#8217;s done so well that you think, &#8220;Oh my gosh, this seems like it just flowed out of the writer and he knew exactly what was going to happen.&#8221;  But it never happens that way for anybody.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all bumbling around and mistakes, and then you happen on something that works.&nbsp; I would write large portions of Trish&#8217;s section or Rusty&#8217;s, and it was all a giant mess.&nbsp; At one point it was 1400 pages long.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How did you get clarity on it?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; This was the most difficult thing I&#8217;ve ever done, and for a time, for probably four or five months, I really believed it had failed completely.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: For how many years had you been working on it at that point?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b> I&#8217;d been working on it already for five years.&nbsp; I was on page, let&#8217;s just say, 900, and I was only two-thirds of the way through it.&nbsp; I was thinking, &#8220;What <I>is</I> this?&nbsp; What have I done?&#8221;  But once I had it all finished, in a sense, when I had 1400 pages, it actually became pretty easy.&nbsp; Once I started cutting away all the background that I needed as a writer but that the reader didn&#8217;t need, it became easy at that point.&nbsp; It was just hard really right in the middle of it.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I was impressed with the way you carried through some little details, like the ostrich, the wayward piece of gum, the couch Golden can&#8217;t get rid of&#8212;all these things that seem very minor when the reader first encounters them end up to have major plot implications.&nbsp; Did you know when you first started writing about them that these little details would take on such big roles?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b> I knew the gum.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why, it&#8217;s such a stupid thing.&nbsp; But I knew that the gum would be almost the main plot point of the entire novel.&nbsp; And I wanted that because it&#8217;s kind of absurd.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a little bit ridiculous.&nbsp; But the novel&#8217;s so heavy and dark and grief-laden, that I wanted humor to be at the forefront with these comic scenes.&nbsp; But with the couch and the ostrich&#8212;you throw things in there as a writer and you just keep coming back to them, and you see, &#8220;Oh, this is something.&#8221;  The couch became a symbol and the ostrich became kind of a symbol.&nbsp; They just sort of announce themselves: this is important.&nbsp; So you just keep going back to them.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: The ostrich almost becomes the grim reaper.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  Yeah, somebody wrote me an email and said, &#8220;Is the ostrich even real?&nbsp; It seems like the ostrich is a being from another world, like a demon.&#8221;  And that&#8217;s not the case at all.&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of cool that somebody would think that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s this thing watching over these horrible events that are taking place.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: The gum ends up preventing Golden from committing adultery.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  It does.&nbsp; He thinks that way for a while, and he even thinks that God might have been involved in placing it there.&nbsp; That&#8217;s an absurd thing, but people think this sort of thing all the time.&nbsp; But what I like in that scene when he&#8217;s thinking about it, in the end he thinks it&#8217;s Glory [one of his children] that kept him from committing adultery, not the gum.&nbsp; The opportunity that he might be able to see her again in the afterlife.&nbsp; At least that&#8217;s what he decides.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: The way you just described the novel&#8212;that it&#8217;s dark and sad with comedy on top&#8212;I experienced it the opposite way.&nbsp; How did you balance your tone?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  I set out to right a book that is comic and tragic simultaneously as possible.&nbsp; I knew that it would end with a wedding and a funeral, which are the traditional comedy and tragedy endings.&nbsp; It was important for me to push the limit of how much comic and tragic material could be placed in close quarters.&nbsp; That&#8217;s my favorite kind of writing, and I don&#8217;t think a lot of writers do it these days.&nbsp; There&#8217;s either very comic writers or very earnest, tragedy-laden stories that people write, and I really love it when people can do those two things simultaneously.&nbsp; You just have to be reckless in some ways.&nbsp; Even at a funeral that&#8217;s supposed to be sad, you have to be open to the opportunity of having a comic moment at any time.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: That kind of novel seems more true to life to me, when humor is mixed in with sad things that happen.</b>
<br />
 
<br />
<b>BU:</b>  Humor, to me, is the most important thing.&nbsp; Because what humor or comedy brings is a kind of perspective.&nbsp; Tragedy is us taking ourselves way too seriously.&nbsp; Even when bad things happen, comedy is just about perspective.&nbsp; It&#8217;s standing back.&nbsp; And when you stand back far enough, just about anything is funny.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: I read a lot of books that are set in the West, and that&#8217;s what I miss most in them.&nbsp; I wish there were more funny books set in the West.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot of tough guy stuff.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  It&#8217;s a lot of tough guy stuff, it&#8217;s a lot of landscape stuff.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot of sort of Hemingway, Cormac McCarthy stuff&#8212;which I like&#8212;but a lot of barren landscape with the cowboy figure.&nbsp; The lone gunman.&nbsp; I think it takes away from the quality that I think makes the West interesting.&nbsp; The landscape is beautiful and compelling, but it&#8217;s the <I>people</I>.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough focus on people, the actual people, in a lot of Western short stories and novels.
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: There are some funny writers in the Pacific Northwest, like Jess Walter and Sherman Alexie.&nbsp; But we could use more of that.&nbsp; I was glad to find your book.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>BU:</b>  Sherman is interesting, because Sherman doesn&#8217;t do landscape at all.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just people talking and doing a few things.&nbsp; He&#8217;s one of the few Native American writers that&#8217;s doing that too.&nbsp; It&#8217;s people giving the reading community what they think the reading community wants, and that&#8217;s the West as this mythic place.&nbsp; I just don&#8217;t find that as interesting.
</p>
<p>
<I>Check back tomorrow for second half of the interview, in which we discuss how Udall kept track of the dozens of names in his novels, how traveling from Utah to Nevada is metaphorically, &#8220;like crossing the border from heaven into hell,&#8221; how he felt &#8220;much more comfortable hanging out with polygamists than going into a brothel,&#8221; and how New York publishers tend to ignore Western writers.</I>

		<b>Comment By Chérie Newman, 5-03-10</b>
		<p>I love this book and all it's rich symbols, especially the couch (a.k.a. The Barge). In Chapter One, Udall described The Barge as “a stinky, broken-down, truly wonderful old wreck of a couch.” But by Chapter 43, the couch seemed to represent something much more significant. Consider this passage from a scene in which Golden and one of his wives are about to have sex on the couch:<br />
<br />
“She let her body ease into his. This is what she had always loved most about him: his body, his movement and shape, his smell. It was a smell that, when mixed with the rich, percolating odors of the couch, produced in her something like yearning or nostalgia; there were the bodily perfumes of thousands of children in their various ages and incarnations, baby lotion and wet diapers and shampooed hair, the faint metallic tang of old pennies and autumn leaves stuck to the bottoms of shoes, the residue of smoky winter nights and summer dust. For her, it was a smell that meant family and memory and time. It was the smell—and she could find no better word for it—of home.”<br />
<br />
Throughout the book, Golden and the couch had much in common. Both were large, extremely flawed, and not quite sure where they belonged.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 5-03-10</b>
		<p>Thanks for sharing that, Chérie.  Before I wrote my review of The Lonely Polygamist, I was writing down some of my favorite quotes, but I had to stop because I was copying down half the book.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Page, 6-05-10</b>
		<p>After savoring the book for a couple weeks, I finished it last night.  Thanks for putting together such a comprehensive interview.  I waited to read it all until I was done, and I'm glad I did.<br />
<br />
My favorite part? June's first letter to Trish, with the architectural grade directions to his house.  What a great touch this man has.</p>

							Gary Gerhardt recently reported in the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://insidedenver.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4233341,00.html" title=""Westerners changing way they see animals"">"Westerners changing way they see animals"</a>) on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.warnercnr.colostate.edu/NRRT/hdnr/human.htm" title="a new study by Colorado State University">a new study by Colorado State University</a> that measured peopleâ€™s attitudes toward wildlife in 19 Western states. The study, led by CSU professor Mike Manfredo, shows that in the Rocky Mountain West, Coloradoans have the cuddliest attitude toward animals, with 34.9% of respondents charting as â€œanimal lovers, ranging from wildlife watchers to animal rights advocates, who donâ€™t condone hunting or fishing,â€? versus 34.1% who believe wildlife exists for â€œpersonal or economic uses, such as hunting or fishing.â€? <br />
<br />
New Mexico residents surveyed showed a similar split, with 31.9% supporting the animals-as-friends view, and 35.2% taking the animals-are-good-eating position.  Utah, Montana, and Wyoming residents surveyed espouse more traditional Western values toward wildlife, with between  44 and 48% falling into the hunting and fishing camp and between 18-20% favoring the furry companion view.  The two outliers in the study were Alaska, in favor of hunters (50% vs. 15.3%) and Hawaii, in favor of animal lovers (40.6% vs. 25.4%). Among the 19 states, only Hawaii and California had a higher percentage of animal lovers than Colorado, which could reflect the fact that many Californians have moved here,  or it could suggest that hunting is simply dying out as an accepted  practice among Colorado residents. <br />
<br />
The CSU study divided respondents between those with the â€œUtilitarian Wildlife Orientation,â€? who regard â€œhunting as a humane and positive activityâ€? and believe that â€œwildlife exists for human use and enjoyment,â€? and those with the â€œMutualism Wildlife Orientationâ€? which â€œis associated with the desire for humans and wildlife to co-exist or live in harmony.â€? Some respondents charted high on both scales (evidencing a â€œpluralisticâ€? attitude toward wildlife), and some charted low on both scales (evidencing a â€œdistancedâ€? attitude toward wildlife).  The study notes that these attitudes toward wildlife have broad implications for public policy decisions.  For example, those who fall into the Utilitarian camp favor the management of â€œwildlife so that humans benefitâ€? and â€œprioritize the needs of humans over wildlife.â€? Those with the Mutualism orientation â€œassign animals rights like humansâ€? and seek to prevent cruelty to animals.<br />
<br />
The exhaustive, 344-page study is available online, and it explores such issues as how and why attitudes toward wildlife are changing, and what people believe should be done about deer overpopulation.  One of the conclusions is that â€œcompared with the other two groups, Utilitarians and Pluralists are older, more likely to hunt, more likely to have lived in the state for a longer period of time, and more likely to be male.â€? If longtime residents are more likely to support hunting and fishing, the increasing influx of newcomers to the region will likely have implications for wildlife policy in the future. <br />

		<p>CSU seems to be asking a question that serves to obscure rather than illuminate. Trying to say that there are two separate camps--one that hunts, and one that "loves" wildlife is nuts.<br />
<br />
The most intense and intertwined relationships between mankind and wild animals are a profound mixture of utilitarianism and love. Ask any subsistence hunter, or any number of big game hunters who have been the driving force for wildlife and wildlands conservation and environmental protection in the United States.<br />
The folks who see the wild creatures as "cuddly" <br />
don't seem to pay much attention to, or donate much time or cash, to organizations that protect habitat. And I do not personally know any hunters (I bet they are out there, but I've avoided them) who would ever say something as repulsive as "wildlife exists for the pleasure of human beings." <br />
<br />
If what you've written of the study-and I have not read the study, of course-- is representative, then what it most illuminates is that we desparately need...Ahah, said long ago, by the wonderful <br />
Henry Beston, 1888-1968<br />
The Outermost House<br />
We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals ... We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err and err greatly. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren; they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth <br />
End quote<br />
<br />
Try asking Coloradans about that and see what the repsonses would be! <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, Hal Herring</p>

		<p>Hi Hal,<br />
<br />
I don't think I've done justice to the study in this little post--there's a lot of data in the report, and I suggest you check out the link to it if you're interested.  As I understand it, the study doesn't suggest that hunters don't care for animals--It evaluates respondents along these matrices of whether they believe hunting is acceptable or not, whether they do or would hunt personally, or whether they think hunting is completely wrong.  Hunters are more likely to see wildlife as something that should be managed for human benefit (which doesn't mean they think wildlife should be extinguished or disrespected) and then on the extreme other end, according to the Rocky Mountain News, the study found some people "who said if there was an accident involving a human and an animal, they would help the animal first."  I haven't been able to digest the whole 344 pages of it yet, but I think that the study concludes that most hunters feel a close bond with animals, even though their attitude differs in key ways from non-hunters.</p>

		<p>I'll read it, Jenny. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. Sometimes I think that the most basic questions--the ones from which all others spring--is how mankind relates to the rest of creation. We have a dark and repulsive record, shot through in places with a pure light--ie. wilderness protection, the ESA, etc.(laws enacted without concrete motivations of profit or human health concerns)and a huge number of individuals who live lightly and mindfully and can be found in every nation of the world. <br />
I'll leave one last quote if I can find it. <br />
 From Richard Nelson:<br />
I will never know if animals and plants have spirits, if the tree I stand beside is aware of my presence, if respectful gestures bring hunting luck or protect my well-being. But I am absolutely certain it is wise and responsible to behave as if these things were true.</p>

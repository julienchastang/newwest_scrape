The discussion we had here recently about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/in_search_of_the_literature_of_the_urban_west/C39/L39/" title="the literature of the urban west">the literature of the urban west</a> is a personal one for me&#8212;<i>Mile High</i> is my love song to my hometown, Denver, and it&#8217;s very urban.

<p>
As a part of this contest, I received a Publishers Weekly review of my full manuscript.&nbsp; Now I know what it&#8217;s like to be on the receiving end of a glowing review:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Manuscript review by Publishers Weekly, an independent organization: In this powerful melodrama, Denver police officer Ed O&#8217;Fallon shoots Salvador Santillano in the course of enforcing a drug warrant, leaving Santillano&#8217;s wife, Patricia Maestas, a widow. As Ed navigates his complicated aftermath emotions, Patricia struggles to understand how her husband could have been on the receiving end of a cop&#8217;s gun. Tension escalates when further investigation reveals that a police error may be at the root of the drug raid gone wrong. The two seemingly disparate families are brought together again when their sons unknowingly find themselves first as rivals, then as teammates, in an elite Little League division. The author creates rich portraits of each family, deftly presenting a complex set of circumstances and handling it with intelligence and authenticity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Now that&#8217;s more than enough about me.&nbsp; Wannabe princesses are far more interesting, like the one <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jan/19/thorn-quest-to-marry-prince-leads-to-unique/" title="Patti Thorn profiled">Patti Thorn profiled</a> this Saturday for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>.&nbsp; Although <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jerramyfine.com" title="Jerramy Fine">Jerramy Fine</a> was born in Montrose, Colorado, her goal in life was to marry a British prince.&nbsp; Her new memoir, <I> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Someday-Prince-Will-Come-Adventures/dp/1592403522/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200888703&amp;sr=1-1" title="Someday My Prince Will Come: The True Adventures of a Wannabe Princess">Someday My Prince Will Come: The True Adventures of a Wannabe Princess</a></I> was recently published by Gotham Books.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Thorn writes, &#8220;while its literary merits turn out to be mixed, there&#8217;s no question Fine&#8217;s tale is unique.&#8221;  Fine moved to England in pursuit of her dream, but according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jerramyfine.com/about.asp" title="bio on her website">bio on her website</a>, she&#8217;s settled for a non-royal English boyfriend.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Thorn notes that Fine previously made literary news for a book that was never published, a fictionalized account of her job verifying records for the Guinness Book of World Records. (Including the longest penis extension.&nbsp; Any guesses?&nbsp; Answer: three inches.)  According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/03/nguin03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/04/03/ixhome.html" title="London Telegraph">London Telegraph</a>, Guinness threatened to sue, and HarperCollins nixed the book deal, saying they did not &#8220;actively seek litigation.&#8221;

		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 1-23-08</b>
		<p>Thanks for checking it out.  That requirement that you have to have bought something from Amazon within the past year to leave a review has stymied a lot of people.  I think they did it to prevent people from making up a bunch of amazon accounts and voting for themselves repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valiant effort, anyway!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Paula Younger, 1-24-08</b>
		<p>I'm joining in the shameless self-promoting.  I am also a semi-finalist in the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award for my book, HERE WITH THE SAINTS.  If you would like to help another struggling writer out, please click on my excerpt and review my novel: <br />

<br />
Thank you for the support!</p>

		<p>Mrs. Younger. Based on your add on of shameless promotion alone, I checked out your link. Liked your exerpt so much I gave it a good review! Don't you also write reviews for this blog as well? Does that mean you should also get to review your own reviews like Mrs. Shank?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 1-25-08</b>
		<p>Damn Jenny...just read your story. Immediately wrote a review for Amazon. Wow, humor, drama, heartbreak, all touched with a deep humanity. Well, I'm not going to write another review here. First review I've felt compelled to write on Amazon in the belief that new writers should be given an opportunity to share their gift. Good storytellers are a rare, beautiful and necessary component of our collective humanity. I hope you will get the support you need and deserve. I look forward to this story being published. Please, let us know its fate. Good luck and keep on...</p>

		<p>Hi Michael, <br />
<br />
Thanks so much for your kind words!  I'll find out in a couple of weeks whether or not my book has made the cut to 100.</p>

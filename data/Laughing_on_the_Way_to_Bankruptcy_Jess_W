	In his hilarious and timely new novel, Spokane&#8217;s Jess Walter explores the maxim that there&#8217;s nothing more dangerous than an unemployed man, even though the primary person in danger may be the man himself, as is the case with protagonist Matt Prior.&nbsp; Several years before <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Lives-Poets-Jess-Walter/dp/0061916048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1254681926&amp;sr=8-1" title="The Financial Lives of the Poets">The Financial Lives of the Poets</a></I> begins, Matt was a business reporter for a daily newspaper and he decided to pursue his ill-conceived dream: starting a website that reports business news in poetry form.&nbsp; When Poetfolio.com tanked before it was even launched, something that everyone but Matt could see coming, Matt scurried back to his newspaper job.&nbsp; But because he&#8217;d left, he lost his seniority at the paper, and was one of the first to be laid off when the paper downsized.
</p>
<p>
	Matt couldn&#8217;t afford to lose his job: he&#8217;s got an enormous mortgage on a big house, a car payment, a garage full of supposedly collectible crap that his wife purchased in a compulsive shopping binge on eBay, and two non-Catholic young sons who attend Catholic school because the neighborhood public school reminds Matt of Sing-Sing.&nbsp; One evening when Matt has just received a letter from the mortgage company threatening foreclosure in a week, he is becoming increasingly suspicious of his wife&#8217;s Facebook conversations with her old high school boyfriend, and his unemployment benefits are about to run out, Matt heads to a 7-Eleven to buy some milk.&nbsp; &#8220;Two tattooed white kids in silk sweat suits step to the line behind me and I tense a little, double-pat my wallet,&#8221; Walter writes.&nbsp; As Matt walks outside, one of the guys offers him &#8220;a hit on a glass blunt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Matt refuses at first, but because his resistance is worn down, he agrees when the young men, Skeet and Jamie, ask for a ride to a party.&nbsp; Awash in nostalgia for his college days, Matt eventually samples the weed, which is considerably more potent than what he remembers. Jamie explains its origins in this way: &#8220;In this lab in British Columbia?&nbsp; This Nobel Prize dude?&nbsp; He Frankensteined that shit?&nbsp; It&#8217;s knock-off, but shit&#8217;s still pretty good.&nbsp; They can do whatever they want to it, you know?&nbsp; Make it do a thousand different things to your mind, yo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	After a long night in the stoners&#8217; company, Matt visits his financial planner who tells him, &#8220;unless you&#8217;re about to inherit some money, what we&#8217;re talking about here is irreversible, fatal.&nbsp; You have fiscal Ebola, Matt.&#8221;  Matt comes up with the solution to all his problems: he drains his depleted bank account sets himself up as a pot dealer to stressed-out professionals like himself.&nbsp; As the reader guesses, things go downhill from there.&nbsp; Part of the fun of <I>The Financial Lives of the Poets</I> is seeing just how big of a mess Walter can embroil Matt in, and finding out how he&#8217;ll get out of it.
</p>
<p>
Walter&#8217;s last novel, 2006&#8217;s <I>The Zero</I>, based on his experience ghostwriting a memoir for New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik in the days immediately following the 9-11 attack, was a finalist for the National Book Award. <I>The Financial Lives of the Poets</I> is equally satisfying, but in a different way.&nbsp; Filled with hilarious dialogue and situations, Matt&#8217;s loopy internal monologues, and lots of poetry that is pretty bad (as Matt readily admits), <I>The Financial Lives of the Poets</I> sometimes seems like it might spin off into nothing more than a comic farce.&nbsp; But then Walter grounds the story with moments of genuine feeling, such as his portrayal of Matt&#8217;s relationship with his live-in senile father, his touching descriptions of the children, or Matt&#8217;s desperate love for his straying wife.&nbsp; One of Matt&#8217;s stronger poems, &#8220;Dry Falls,&#8221; describes the place where his dad lived in rural Oregon before his dementia set in.&nbsp; It begins:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
Dad&#8217;s land is scabbed and pocked
<br />
river channels that forgot not to die
<br />
couleed ditches and hard veined cracks
<br />
of channeled dust in his razored cheeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>
	Walter&#8217;s portrait of a dying newspaper and the shell-shocked demeanor of the journalists still hanging on there is funny, bitter, and accurate, speaking from the perspective of someone who had a decent view of the demise of the Rocky Mountain News. <I>The Financial Lives of the Poets</I> paints a picture of the farcical existence many Americans had been living, using credit to spend cash like it was Monopoly money.&nbsp; And although this message could come off as a repetitive lecture in another writer&#8217;s hands, reading it through Jess Walter&#8217;s buoyant voice is a fresh pleasure.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<I>Jess Walter will discuss <I>The Financial Lives of the Poets</I> at Powells Books in Portland, Ore. on October 29, in Missoula at Fact and Fiction on November 5, and at the University Bookstore in Moscow, Idaho on December 3.</I>

		<p>Walter's Citizen Vince (Edgar winner) is fantastic.  I also liked his Ruby Ridge non-fiction book, although the early crime novels were pretty vanilla.</p>

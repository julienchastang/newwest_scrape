							Novelists <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mashahamilton.com/" title="Masha Hamilton">Masha Hamilton</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.judihendricks.com/" title="Judith Ryan Hendricks">Judith Ryan Hendricks</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danielakuper.com/" title="Daniela Kuper">Daniela Kuper</a> met at a writerâ€™s seminar where they were all speaking, and hatched an idea for a different kind of book tour.  Last night at the Boulder Book Store, Kuper explained their thinking: â€œWhy donâ€™t we stop doing what fiction writers do at readingsâ€”pump only your own book, read from it, take questions, then go home.  Instead, why donâ€™t we cooperate and push each otherâ€™s work.â€?  The result was the <i>Strong Women Characters: In Fiction, In Person</i> tour.  The night opened with each author reading a quote from a female fiction writer about a female character, including an excerpt from Carol Shieldâ€™s â€œUnlessâ€? and Amy Bloomâ€™s short story â€œSilver Water.â€?  Then each woman spoke a little about herself, read an excerpt of her book, and introduced the next writer on the panel.<br />
<br />
As might be apparent by the tourâ€™s title, things got a little Oprah-y from time to time, with panel and audience members praising â€œstrong womenâ€? who had changed their lives, and Kuper advising an aspiring writer in the audience to stop making excuses and get on with her writing, Girl!  Okay, she didnâ€™t say â€œgirl,â€? but everyone in the mostly female audience probably filled in the blank.<br />
<br />
Kuper was a Colorado businesswoman for many years, living in Boulder for 25 years, working at an advertising agency and eventually starting her own company.  She spent nine years writing her debut novel, <i>Hunger And Thirst</i>, a book set in the 1950â€™s that concerns a woman who runs a â€œfrock shop.â€?  â€œMy mother seemed to have her lips sewn shut like a lot of women in the â€˜50s,â€? Kuper said.  â€œI wanted to write a book about women in that era doing what they wanted to do.â€?  The main character leaves her family and child, and Kuper believes she does this to â€œsave her life.â€?<br />
<br />
Masha Hamilton was a war reporter in the Middle East, covering stories in Afghanistan when she realized that she â€œhad more room to tell the truth in fiction than in reporting the news.â€?  She described strong women sheâ€™d met in Afghanistan, including one who â€œlived in Kabul during the time of the Taliban and held secret meetings in her home for women.â€?  She was caught and jailed, and as soon as she was free she resumed the meetings.  The situation for women in Afghanistan now that the Taliban has been deposed is still grave, Hamilton explained.  Another woman Hamilton met after the fall of the Taliban â€œwas jailed for fleeing her husband whoâ€™d beat her for years,â€? Hamiltonâ€™s novel, <i>The Distance Between Us</i>, is a fictional story of a female war correspondent in the Middle East who realizes she can no longer remain neutral and that â€œsheâ€™s part of the story she covers.â€?<br />
<br />
Judith Ryan Hendricks was a baker before she began writing, and she uses her background to fuel her novels including <i>The Bakerâ€™s Apprentice</i>.  Hendricks discussed how her grandmother influenced her.  â€œShe was married in New York, and her husband took her to California away from everyone she knew.â€? Hendricksâ€™ grandfather cheated on her grandmother, gambled, and drank all their money away, so her grandmother was forced to supply all the income for the familyâ€™s four kids during the depression, killing chickens, working in factories, and raising her own food.  â€œMy grandmother used to ditch school to go be in silent movies, and when she got married that was all over.  She was too busy raising and supporting a family to have time to do anything creatively.  In the past, women really suffered from a lack of creative expression.â€?<br />
<br />
The <i>Strong Women Characters: In Fiction, In Person</i> is a part of the growing trend in alternative book promotion that moves away from the traditional single-author-reading-in-a-bookstore format, allowing low-budget authors whose publishers wouldnâ€™t normally foot the bill for a tour to get out and discuss their book.  <br />
<br />
On Tuesday, October 25, a similarly-styled event will hit the Wynkoop Brewery in Denver, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&eventId=310485" title="First Fiction Author Tour">First Fiction Author Tour</a>, featuring a group of first time novelists touring the country together, reading at bars rather than bookstores.  Last yearâ€™s <i>First Fiction</i> tour was a huge hit at the Wynkoopâ€”the reading area was so packed that I couldnâ€™t even squeeze into the room, and attendees were clearly enjoying the $1 microbrews.  And the <i>Strong Women Characters</i> tour seemed to be a success last night as well, with Hamilton and Hendricks benefiting from the home town crowd that Kuper drew, each of them probably selling more books and connecting with more readers than they would have been able to on their own.  So, I guess theyâ€™ve earned it: You go, girls!<br />

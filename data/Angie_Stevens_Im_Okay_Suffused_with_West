							Denver singer-songwriter <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angiestevens.com" title="Angie Stevens">Angie Stevens</a> had been playing solo shows for years when she formed a three-piece band in January of this year.  It didnâ€™t take the group long to finish the arrangements for a solid set of rootsy songs and record a debut, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hapiskratch.net/store/popup_image.php/pID/554" title="I'm Okay">I'm Okay</a>, which she self-released in March. On the album, Stevens explores that quintessential country topic: heartbreak.  And though Stevensâ€™ sweet voice is as strong and clear as that of a Nashville diva, sheâ€™s fighting the good fight, hewing closer to countryâ€™s humble folk roots than its gussied-up modern spawn.  The album doesnâ€™t quite fit into the alt-country categoryâ€”production effects have polished off a few too many of the edges, and it doesnâ€™t twang as much as it might, but it still sits comfortably alongside the work of a number of recent young traditionalists, such as Mindy Smith and Kasey Chambers.<br />
<br />
â€œIâ€™m Okay,â€? is essentially a break-up album, though the object of the rupture seems to shift between a romantic attachment and a homeland, and the lyrics often conflate the two losses.  Almost all the songs are addressed to a â€œyou,â€? and thereâ€™s even a jaunty fiddle-and-acoustic-guitar tune called â€œFirst Love,â€? in which Stevens begins singing in rather sheepish tones, and gradually builds to belting, â€œFirst love, first snow/ both seem to fall all around.â€? Although most of Stevens songs are written in this same confessional vein, she prevents her emphasis on the personal from cloying by reaching beyond it to grasp at elemental conceptsâ€”the words water, fire, sun, moon, burn, and preacher recur.<br />
<br />
Stevens grew up in South Dakota, and the open land and wide sky of that state is recalled in the way she reaches for and creates space in the climaxes of several of her songs, her voice soaring through â€œHeaven Knows,â€? and producing some high lonesome keening in â€œLittle Things.â€?  One of the most affecting songs on <i>Iâ€™m Okay</i> is the gentle â€œHome Sweet Home,â€? a lovelorn lament for a left-behind land: â€œHome sweet home/ rolling plains full of snow/ grass and trees and plenty of streams/ how I miss my home sweet home.â€? Now in the city, she confronts the urban landscapeâ€™s simultaneous crowding and loneliness: â€œCars, streets filled, no stars/ the quiet wonâ€™t let me in/ The lack of one on one/ The quiet wonâ€™t let me in.â€?<br />
<br />
There is a very Western longing in several of Stevensâ€™ songs to head even yet further West to escape circumstance, as in â€œRestlessnessâ€?: â€œ Let me pick up, go somewhere/ leave this all behind/ and hope that when I get there/ what I want is what I find.â€?  After releasing such an accomplished debut, hopefully Stevens will not act on this impulse to flee, and will keep entertaining local audiences for some years to come.<br />
<br />
Lately, Stevens has been playing live steadily throughout the metro area, and she has several shows scheduled for this month, including an appearance at the Denver <a target="_blank" href="http://www.liltfestival.com" title="L.I.L.T. Festival">L.I.L.T. Festival</a> on Saturday, August 13 at the Foxhole Lounge, and a show at Boulderâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rocknsoulcafe.com/" title="Rock N Soul CafÃ©">Rock N Soul CafÃ©</a> on Wednesday, August 17.<br />

		<p>I'm glad to see the album reviewed. I think it's an exceptional album and hope more people have a chance to listen to it. I'm 56 and some of the songs very much remind me of music I heard in the 1950s and 1960s. <br />
<br />
Some of them have a 60s slow dance beat to them. Recently I heard Leslie Gore's "You Don't Own Me" and the Righteous Brothers "Unchained Melody" on the radio and thought, "Yes!" that's what I hear on Angie's album. <br />
<br />
Other songs remind me of stuff that the Grand Ole Opry was playing on its radio broadcasts years ago.<br />
<br />
And the vulnerability in her voice is reminiscent of bluegrass singers.<br />
<br />
She's also worth seeing live. There's an intensity to her performances which I can only compare to Janis Joplin or Judy Garland. Not the same kind of music, but the same total involvement.</p>

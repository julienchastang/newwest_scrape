							<p>Oh joy: According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001514.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1" title="Variety">Variety</a>, Joel and Ethan Coen will make a film adaptation of Charles Portis&#8217; Western classic <I>True Grit</I> for their next project, and joy of joys, it&#8217;s not to be a traditional remake of the 1969 John Wayne vehicle, but a version intended to hue closer to the novel.&nbsp; (I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/true_grit_turns_forty/C39/L39/" title="wrote last year">wrote last year</a> about the charms of Portis&#8217;s <I>True Grit</I> in honor of its 40th anniversary.)  The Coen brothers were at work on another literary adaptation&#8212;of Michael Chabon&#8217;s <I>The Yiddish Policeman&#8217;s Union</I>&#8212;but <I>True Grit</I> will now come first.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Joel Cohen told London&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-522794/Joel-Ethan-Coen-saddle-truly-gritty-remake-Western-classic.html" title="Daily Mail">Daily Mail</a> that they plan to stick closer to the perspective of the14-year-old narrator, Mattie Ross.&nbsp; &#8220;The book recounts the girl&#8217;s story.&nbsp; In the John Wayne film, she was played older. We want her to be her real age - it&#8217;s her story!&#8221;
</p>
<p>
If there is a better match between filmmakers and book, I can&#8217;t think of it. (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/nview.jsp?appid=411&amp;j=651114" title="Shelf Awareness">Shelf Awareness</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, California-based Jane Smiley got into a regional dust-up at a New York Public Library reception for the finalists for the Man Booker International Prize, according to Taylor Antrim of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/the-man-booker-international-prize/" title="The Daily Beast">The Daily Beast</a>.&nbsp; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://fictionwritersreview.com/blog/jane-smiley-vs-new-york-writing-scene" title="Fiction Writers Review">Fiction Writers Review</a>.) The crux of the matter was this:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Midway through the question-and-answer session, [Tina] Brown asked the judges if the deaths in recent years of major literary figures such as Updike, Bellow, and Mailer represented the end of an era. With fewer readers, straitened times for book publishing, and less coverage of books in the media, could such literary giants ever emerge again?
</p>
<p>
Smiley&#8217;s answer was tart: &#8216;When those figures died, they were colossal&#8212;in New York. They were not colossal in San Francisco or Minneapolis.&#8217; She went on to argue that the literary world is more dispersed than it used to be, &#8216;but it&#8217;s just as passionate.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Jay McInerney, who was also on the panel, got into it with Smiley a bit--you can read the full account of the sordid details in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/the-man-booker-international-prize/" title="Antrim's column">Antrim&#8217;s column</a>, but for our purposes here at the Western Book Roundup, the interesting part is that Smiley spoke up for readers in other parts of the country who may not be interested in the same books New York readers are interested in.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve always felt something of a disconnect between the New York publishing world and what people are reading here in the Rocky Mountain region.&nbsp; It seems to me that books that appeal to specific, non-New York regions around the country are apt to sell as well as those that are in favor in Manhattan.&nbsp; But then I don&#8217;t have any numbers to back up my hunch, other than my casual observation that regional writers often seem to be on top of the Denver bestseller list that runs in the Denver Post.&nbsp; This also brings up a chicken-and-the-egg question--since a lot of media are based in New York, magazines and television shows are more likely to cover books that appeal to their New York-based journalists, driving more sales of those books.&nbsp; And with papers across the country shutting entirely or closing their books sections, as the <a target="_blank" href="http://booksblog.guidelive.com/archives/2009/03/houston-chronicle-books-editor.html" title="Houston Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a> did last week, there is less likely to be coverage of books with regional appeal.&nbsp; What do you think?
</p>
<p>
And I&#8217;m not against New York-centric writing--I read and enjoy a lot of it.&nbsp; Speaking of which, I am, as always, shamefully behind on my stack of <i>New Yorker</i> issues, and I came across something of interest in the March 2 one.&nbsp; In it, <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/03/02/090302crat_atlarge_gopnik?currentPage=all" title="Adam Gopnik writes about Damon Runyon">Adam Gopnik writes about Damon Runyon</a>, who apparently grew up in Colorado, along with a couple of other prominent New York writers of that era.&nbsp; (I didn&#8217;t know this.)
</p>
<p>
Gopnik writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By a cosmic coincidence, Damon Runyon was born in Manhattan, but it was Manhattan, Kansas&#8212;as though God were giving him the right birthplace for the obit but keeping him away from his true home until he was ready. The young Runyon actually grew up in Colorado, and stayed there until he was thirty. The Colorado-Manhattan connection in that period is so singular as to look almost significant: the newspaperman Gene Fowler, who was the prime historian of John Barrymore and the other hard-drinking upper-Broadway thespians (as they called themselves), came from there; and so did this magazine&#8217;s Harold Ross, the epitome of a country boy landing a biplane on Broadway. If there&#8217;s any meaning to the pattern, it may be that Colorado wasn&#8217;t Iowa. In the tales about the early years of all three guys, there is always an emphasis on con games seen, card games played, a quarrel with Bat Masterson just missed. These guys are not farming. A newspaper-trained poker player coming from Colorado in those years probably thought of himself as cannier and tougher than the city slickers, who were there to be taken. Runyon had met Harry the Horse, or another version of him, before he ever got to town.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
So it&#8217;s Colorado folks, not people from Iowa or New York, who really have true grit.&nbsp; I always suspected as much.

		<p>Thank the Lord the Coen brothers are taking an interest in rescuing True Grit from John Wayne.  Wayne overwhelmed that old movie, and the Rocky Mountain scenery busted the power of the book, which is set in Oklahoma. I can't wait to see the Coen version.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bill Croke, 4-01-09</b>
		<p>And yet Smiley, for all her indignation, has made a ton of money and garnered many honors in the New York publishing milieu. So, there's some hypocrisy there. Besides, she lives in Carmel, and despite her Midwestern roots seems to be at home in loony left California. Her politics nauseate me. I have never, nor will, read the woman--not for a thousand acres.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By horst, 4-01-09</b>
		<p>Posted carefully around the hayseed in both instances; but with  rightwingloony libertarian malice in the latter.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patia, 4-02-09</b>
		<p>You have a point about NY-centric literature, but I think it's balanced somewhat by urban romanticizing of the West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Page, 4-06-09</b>
		<p>To some extent, it's a function of population and density.  We have exactly one real bookstore in Blaine County, ID and most counties around here have none.  There's a few in Boise, and some scattered here and there in the north and southeast.  Tough to maintain a literary tradition when that's the case, and even harder to have an impact on the bestseller lists.<br />
<br />
As the papers and the bookshops disappear, it becomes even more difficult in the less-peopled west to spread the word about good writing, even with the internet around to make up for it a bit.  I don't think that will have an impact on the quality of western writing though - at least I hope not.</p>

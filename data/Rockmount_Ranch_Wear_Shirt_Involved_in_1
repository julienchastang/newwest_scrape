							It has been a heady week for Denver's historic Western shirt purveyor, <a href="http://www.rockmount.com" title="Rockmount Ranch Wear">Rockmount Ranch Wear</a>.  Yesterday, the company had two brushes with fame: it was selected for a feature on Friday's broadcast of the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/03/eveningnews/main1276706.shtml" title="CBS Evening News">CBS Evening News</a>, and one of its shirts sold as a part of a pair for $101,100.51 on <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7589737258" title="eBay">eBay</a> after ten days of bidding on the garments closed Monday afternoon.  Rockmount is known for its Western shirts of impeccable quality and design, but that's not all the $100,000 shirt had going for it.  The company supplied many items for the wardrobes of actors in <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, and Heath Ledger wore this particular shirt in his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar that was sold along with a blue denim shirt worn by Jake Gyllenhall. The website states that "these are the original and authentic blood-stained shirts from the film," and the proceeds from the sale will go to Variety, The Children's Charity.<br />
<br />
As Rockmount's Steve Weil explained in a press release, "The shirt plays a major role in the film with a cameo at the end.  Too bad there is no academy award for Best Shirt."  The shirt indeed was integral to the movie's plot as a symbol of the love between the two main characters, putting it up there with Dorothy's ruby slippers in terms of a costume's importance to the physical action and emotional resonance of a film.<br />
<br />
As for the CBS feature, each Friday the CBS Evening News includes a segment called "Assignment America," in which reporter Steve Hartman profiles interesting folk from all over the country.  Every week the news outlet's website pitches three possible stories for the segment, and viewers vote for which one they'd like to see.  Rockmount came up the winner this week, with the teaser: "Steve will introduce us to the inventor of the western shirt, who still goes to work every day…at 104 years old."<br />
<br />
Rockmount does boast a story worthy of national attention.  Founded in 1946 by the now 104-year-old Jack Weil, the business still occupies the same historic brick building in LoDo as it did when it opened.  According to the company's website, Mr. Weil "introduced the first western shirts with snaps and also made the first commercially produced bolo ties." Three generations of Weils are now involved in the company, and "Papa Jack" still serves as C.E.O.  Scads of celebrities have sported Rockmount's appealing designs over the years, including David Bowie, Sandra Cisneros, Elvis Presley, Clark Gable, Bruce Springsteen, Ronald Reagan, and so many others that Rockmount's website features a <a href="http://www.rockmount.com/celebrities/celebrity_gallery.htm" title="Celebrity Gallery">Celebrity Gallery</a> that highlights many of them.<br />
<br />
Despite the company's continued attention from Hollywood and music industry types, you don't have to pay $100,000 for its clothing—most of its shirts are priced affordably enough for the average cowboy at $50-$100.  That plaid Heath Ledger shirt, by the way, is number #6400 in the Rockmount catalogue, retailing at $55.<br />

	Reyna Grande&#8217;s <I>Across A Hundred Mountains</I>, recently published in paperback, offers a human story behind the thousands of immigrants who cross illegally from Mexico to the United States each year.&nbsp; Although the book is fiction, the author&#8217;s personal experience informs her tale.&nbsp; According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://reynagrande.com/bio.htm" title="biography on her website">biography on her website</a>, Grande, who now lives in California, &#8220;entered the U.S. as an illegal immigrant in 1985&#8221; to join her parents when she was ten years old.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the book won the annual El Premio Aztlan Literary Award, started by New Mexico writer <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolfo_Anaya" title="Rudolfo Anaya">Rudolfo Anaya</a> to honor Chicano literature.
</p>
<p>
<I>Across A Hundred Mountains</I> begins with a scene of devastating loss in a Mexican village.&nbsp; Nine-year-old Juana, her baby sister, and mother Lupe are stuck in their flooding shack, waiting for Juana&#8217;s father Miguel to return from his work as a campesino.&nbsp; Lupe goes to search for him, leaving Juana standing on the kitchen table holding her sister.&nbsp; Juana falls asleep while she waits for her parents to return, and the baby dies in the floodwater.&nbsp; The death of the baby sets off a chain of events that destroys the Garc&#237;a family.&nbsp; When Miguel can&#8217;t pay the debt for the baby&#8217;s funeral, he decides to head to the United States to find work, leaving Lupe vulnerable to the rapacious town mortuary director, Don El&#237;as.
</p>
<p>
	The story of Juana is intercut with scenes from the perspective of Adelina, a Mexican American woman who works as a social worker in L.A. and travels to Tijuana to find out the truth about her father&#8217;s disappearance nineteen years earlier.&nbsp; In the first chapter, an old coyote leads her to her father&#8217;s remains, lying where he fell after a snake bit him during his attempt to cross into the U.S.&nbsp; After Lupe is reduced to a raving alcoholic due to grief caused by the deaths of three of her children, Juana embarks on a journey in the opposite direction to find her father in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
	Grande&#8217;s prose is spare and simple, and its clarity is often beautiful, such as in this description of Juana&#8217;s neighborhood in which she remembers walking with her father, whom she calls Ap&#225;:
<br />
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They ran down the street, Ap&#225; pulling her behind him like a kite.&nbsp; She knew they were almost home when the cobbled stones were replaced with dirt and pebbles.&nbsp; And the rows of pink, blue, yellow, purple, and green concrete houses became shacks growing out of the earth.&nbsp; Little shacks made out of bamboo sticks and cardboard, some leaning against one another like little old ladies tired after a long walk.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Plot and structure rather than nuanced characterization are the primary strengths of <I>Across A Hundred Mountains</I>.&nbsp; Although Juana, Adelina, and Lupe are given complexity, the supporting characters tend to be wholly good or evil, such as the leering, corpulent Don El&#237;as who ultimately makes Lupe pay her debt by having sex with him, and Don El&#237;as&#8217; silent, childless wife who &#8220;just sat there, knitting baby clothes she donated to the church.&#8221;  But villains like these help to propel the plot, providing as many dramatic twists and turns as can be found in a telenovela, making the book go down easily in one sitting. 
</p>
<p>
	What is more striking than the influence of villains on the lives of the Garc&#237;a family is the harsh consequences of their poverty and the indifference most of the people they encounter have toward their plight.&nbsp; It&#8217;s expensive to be poor, their indebtedness compounding every woe, ultimately forcing Juana to become a prostitute for a while in Tijuana until she can raise enough money to hire a coyote to lead her across the border.&nbsp; She and others in her position are treated as something less than human, the money-minded coyote ready to abandon them in the desert if the immigration authorities turn up or if they move too slowly.&nbsp; The simple description of Juana&#8217;s desert crossing attempt is riveting, and the perils make it evident that only a person who is so desperate to reach the U.S. that she would be willing to give up her life to do so ever embarks on such a journey.
</p>
<p>
	With &#8220;Across A Hundred Mountains&#8221; Reyna Grande has humanized the lightning-rod topic of illegal immigration by telling the story of one embattled family.

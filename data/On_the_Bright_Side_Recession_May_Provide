							<p>What happens to newspaper journalists when newspapers no longer exist?&nbsp; That&#8217;s a question that&#8217;s many people are attempting to answer now in Colorado as the couple of hundred people who lost their jobs when the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/hickenlooper_says_rockys_demise_will_send_denver_into_a_funk/C39/L39/" title="Rocky Mountain News folded">Rocky Mountain News folded</a> continue to seek new positions.&nbsp; Some of the newly jobless are taking the opportunity to write the book they never had the time to start before--I&#8217;ve heard that there have been a lot of inquiries about jobs and classes at local writing workshops.&nbsp;

And those with extra time on their hands can also work on their writing at the annual <a target="_blank" href="https://lighthousewriters.org/" title="Lighthouse Writers Workshop">Lighthouse Writers Workshop</a> LitFest in Denver from June 5 through 20.&nbsp; There are lots of classes to take with teacher/writers such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freewebs.com/erikakrouse/" title="Erika Krouse">Erika Krouse</a> (who attended the University of Colorado and published stories in The New Yorker and The Atlantic), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_steven_wingate/C39/L39/" title="Steven Wingate">Steven Wingate</a> (teaching the &#8220;Manic Short Story Intensive&#8221; with Andrea Dupree), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_douglas_kurtz/C39/L39/" title="Doug Kurtz">Doug Kurtz</a> (teaching the seminars &#8220;Conflict, Stakes, and Motivation&#8221; and &#8220;On the Scene"), and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_janis_hallowell/C39/L39/" title="Janis Hallowell">Janis Hallowell</a> (teaching a seminar called &#8220;Hearing Voices").&nbsp; There are also readings, parties, and &#8220;salons,&#8221; which sound pretty swank.

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/may/18/cormac-mccarthy-archive-texas" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> noted that the Cormac McCarthy archive went on display a few weeks ago at Texas State University-San Marcos, home of the famed Southwestern Writers Collection.&nbsp; Alison Flood wrote, &#8220;McCarthy&#8217;s entire writing career, from his debut <I>The Orchard Keeper</I> to an unfinished novel <I>The Passenger</I>&#8220; is included in the 98-box archive.&nbsp; Also in those boxes: McCarthy&#8217;s &#8220;1994 play <I>The Stonemason</I>, about an African-American family in Louisville, Kentucky, and four screenplays, including <I>No Country for Old Men</I> &#8211; which McCarthy started as a screenplay in 1984 and adapted into a novel 20 years later.&#8221; (Via <a target="_blank" href="http://news.shelf-awareness.com/msgget.jsp?mid=2847390" title="Shelf Awareness">Shelf Awareness</a>.)

The trailer for the film adaptation of McCarthy&#8217;s <I>The Road</I> has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHYZ7xDyBEw" title="recently surfaced">recently surfaced</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/adaptation/nick_cave_and_cormac_mccarthy_on_the_road_116728.asp" title="to some derision">to some derision</a>.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://booksblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/05/trailer-for-the-road-color-me.html" title="Michael Merschel ">Michael Merschel </a>of the Dallas Morning News described his reaction to it in this way:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ha! Somebody has made a parody of what <i>The Road</i> would look like if the adaptation of the best novel of the decade fell victim to every cliche in Hollywood! How funny!
</p>
<p>
This <i>is</i> a parody, right? &#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Just in time for budget-minded summer reading, the paperback editon of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deannestillman.com" title="Deanne Stillman">Deanne Stillman</a>&#8216;s <I>Mustang: The Saga of the Wild Horse in the American West</I> is out now.&nbsp; We excerpted a portion of Stillman&#8217;s book, &#8220;Comanche: The Horse That Survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn&#8221; (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_1/C39/L39/" title="here">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/comanche_the_horse_that_survived_the_battle_of_the_little_bighorn_part_2/C39/L39/" title="here">here</a>) a few years ago, and since then the book won a California Book Award silver medal for nonfiction and was named a &#8220;Best Book of 2008&#8221; by the Los Angeles Times.

		<p>That looks like bad news about The Road. I had some high hopes. Will have to wait and see. <br />
<br />
Of all the McCarthy, the greatest, in my opinion, is Suttree, a life changing book, deep and clear. <br />
<br />
But I think my favorite is the first one, The Orchard Keeper, and my favorite scene in it is when the law comes to get the old ginseng digger, and he shoots them off his porch, slams the front door in a hail of bullets, rolls behind the woodstove for cover, reloads his ancient single shot shotgun,  AND ROLLS A CIGARETTE while waiting for them to try and bust through the door!<br />
<br />
Now that is style.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bill Croke, 5-27-09</b>
		<p>Jenny, Of course!!!Writing workshops for journalists. Doesn't that tip anybody off as to why newspapers are dying in the first place? And what would the books be about? What I saw at the meltdown that I had an integral role in causing, etc.? Besides, I thought they all went to work for the government. The one's in Washington and New York do. Well, I suppose if you finally take on the role of a political hack on somebody's payroll you can't be called a hypocrite, just an ex-hypocrite. What do you think, Hal? PS--Nice post on Cormac McCarthy, whom I once had enormous respect for until he got Oprahized. Oh well, who can blame him. He endured unspeakable poverty for years. And now I read that he has a new wife who's busily spending all his money. So it goes.</p>

		<p>Чекан друзей тоже надо учитывать. Дональд Трамп, скажем, для двадцатку потянет.</p>

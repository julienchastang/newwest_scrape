		<h1>New Work by Kent Haruf on Stage and Page</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 1-20-10</p>
			
			
							<p>Fans of Colorado author Kent Haruf who are eagerly awaiting the follow-up to his 2004 novel <I>Eventide</I> can enjoy two new Haruf works: the Winter 2009 issue of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.granta.com/" title="Granta">Granta</a> on the theme of work features an essay by Haruf, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dcpa.org/shows-and-events/Shows/eventide/about.aspx" title="Denver Center for the Performing Arts">Denver Center for the Performing Arts</a> will stage the premier of Eric Schmiedl&#8217;s adaptation of <I>Eventide</I> January 29 through February 27 at the Stage Theater.
</p>
<p>
Haruf, who lives in Salida, Colo., volunteers for a hospice.&nbsp; In his essay for Granta, &#8220;Any Man&#8217;s Death,&#8221; he writes about the first patient he worked with, whom he gives the pseudonym George.&nbsp; Haruf visited George and his wife Lena twice a week for a year and a half.&nbsp; The elderly couple had three rowdy dogs, and Haruf writes of one visit:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One time when George was still so sick and weak in that first month of my visiting him, he was lying in bed in the dingy rear bedroom and I went to see him.&nbsp; The dogs were in the room.&nbsp; One of the dogs, the pit bull they called Jackie, was up in the bed with him, walking over his chest and stomach, over his lungs which I understood were filled up with cancer.&nbsp; It looked painful as hell to me.&nbsp; But the dog wouldn&#8217;t get off.&nbsp; So I grabbed the dog by its collar and dragged him off, and in the process I dragged George from the bed too.&nbsp; George and his oxygen tube and the dog and the covers all came piling off on to the hardwood floor.&nbsp; A hell of a deal.&nbsp; But George didn&#8217;t say anything about it and neither did Lena.&nbsp; They both looked as if being dragged out on to the floor was what happened to you in life.&#8221;
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
George and Lena had no children to look after them, so Haruf performs the duties they need help with, such as taking the dogs to the vet, helping George to the bathroom and his appointments, and listening to his stories.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a simple, honest, moving essay that explores, as the title suggests, how in death we are all alike.
</p>
<p>
Eric Schmiedl is the same playwright whose <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/plainsong_sings_at_the_denver_center_for_the_performing_arts/C39/L39/" title="faithful adaptation of Haruf's novel Plainsong">faithful adaptation of Haruf&#8217;s novel Plainsong</a> for the Denver Center for the Performing Arts earned critical acclaim in 2008.&nbsp; The DCPA commissioned another work from Schmiedl, a play based on <I>Eventide</I>, Haruf&#8217;s follow-up to <I>Plainsong</I> that featured many of the same characters.&nbsp; Kent Thompson will direct.&nbsp; According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/127631-Denver-Center-Will-Stage-Premieres-by-Schmiedl-Myler-Wheetman-and-Martinez-in-2010" title="Playbill.com">Playbill.com</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Eric Schmiedl&#8217;s companion piece to last season&#8217;s adaptation of Kent Haruf&#8217;s Plainsong finds the McPheron brothers getting older while their maturing &#8216;adopted&#8217; daughter Victoria navigates college, romance and motherhood. This is a family forged from necessity in rural Holt, Colorado, where everyone does what it takes to overcome loss, survive harsh winters and find that love is never out of reach.&#8217; Philip Pleasants and Mike Hartman will return as the McPheron brothers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

							<p>Denver Mayor Guillermo Vidal proclaimed Friday &#8220;Neal Cassady Day&#8221; in honor of the famous Beat muse&#8217;s 85th birthday. As William Porter wrote in his informative profile of Cassady for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_17253707" title="Denver Post">Denver Post</a>, &#8220;Not bad for a kid who grew up in Larimer Street flophouses, did time in jail and bragged about boosting 500 cars by the time he was 20.&#8221; The Mercury Caf&#233; hosted a party to celebrate the birthday of Cassady, the model for the charismatic Dean Moriarty figure in Jack Kerouac&#8217;s <I>On The Road</I>. Porter listed the many works of literature that feature Cassady, including Keruoac&#8217;s <I>Visions of Cody</I>, Allen Ginsberg&#8217;s &#8220;Howl,&#8221; and Tom Wolfe&#8217;s <I>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</I>.&nbsp; Cassady is also the subject of a new documentary, &#8220;Neal Cassady: The Denver Years,&#8221; by Denver&#8217;s Heather Dalton. Anyone who aspires to be a film producer can help Dalton fund the project on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nealcassady/neal-cassady-the-denver-years" title="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>.

The novel is set in Alaska, and Washington Post book critic Ron Charles described it in this way: &#8220;Inspired by the experience of [Vann&#8217;s] stepmother&#8217;s parents, this story of a family in southern Alaska comes to us in a series of vibrant moments as bracing, invigorating and finally as deadly as the icy water that surrounds these characters.&#8221; Vann has won many writing awards&#8212;check out this mind-boggling list on <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.davidvann.com/ " title="his website">his website</a>, and look for my review of the novel soon.

		<b>Comment By James Work, 3-04-11</b>
		<p>Here's a toast to Cassady!<br />
<br />
The article made me think of another Colorado boy of that generation, Ken Kesey. Born in LaJunta. <br />
<br />
One of my favorite anecdotes concerns another Colorado writer, John Clark Pratt, who showed up at a meeting of the Merry Pranksters to interview Kesey. And Pratt was in his Air Force uniform. Kesey promptly appointed him as the group's military advisor! Those were the days, eh?</p>

		<h1>March Concert Preview</h1>

							The winter concert season in Colorado—which settles in a few weeks before Christmas and lingers through February—is always underwhelming.  How many times can one person see the Michael Martin Murphy Cowboy Christmas or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra?  Who but idle youth can thrill to the arrival of jam band after jam band as they invade mountain town venues like Vail's 8150 and Breckenridge's Sherpa & Yeti's?  But March marks the end of the entertainment doldrums, with plenty of shows on tap by national acts that reasonable human beings would actually want to pay to see.  This month, there are shows to fit every taste, from the indie rock of Jenny Lewis, the atmospheric arena action of David Gray, the folk-tronica of Beth Orton, and the alt-country stylings of Rhett Miller.<br />
<br />
<b>Jenny Lewis</b> earned fans as the lead singer for indie group Rilo Kiley; the appealing singer-songwriter is going it alone this year, touring behind her solo debut <i>Rabbit Fur Coat</i>.  Lewis headlines the Bluebird Theater on March 10. <br />
<br />
If you haven't already snapped up tickets for <a href="http://cc.com/detail.html?eventID=216095" title="The Fray">The Fray</a>'s show on March 10 at the Paramount, it's too late.  The Denver band signed a record deal with Sony when they had barely gotten started, and now they boast national radio play and sold-out shows whenever they return home.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cc.com/detail.html?eventID=215686" title="David Gray">David Gray</a> fans have been waiting a long time to see the mellow British crooner: his Denver show was originally scheduled for last Halloween, but he cancelled his fall tour because of a respiratory illness.  He'll finally appear at the Colorado Convention Center Lecture Hall on March 13.  The tickets from the original dates will be honored, and there are plenty more for sale for $32.50-$42.50.<br />
<br />
The ethereal <b>Beth Orton</b> stops by the Gothic Theatre on March 19 on her national tour behind her new <i>Comfort Of Strangers</i>.  <a href="http://www.foxtheatre.com" title="KT Tunstall">KT Tunstall</a>, a Scottish singer-songwriter who has been receiving attention from NPR and other U.S. media outlets, will headline the Fox Theatre on March 14, with tickets priced at a reasonable $10.25.  After releasing two nearly identical albums, New York garage rockers <a href="http://cc.com/detail.html?eventID=216932" title="The Strokes">The Strokes</a> change things up a bit on their new <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>.  Fans can hear the new songs live at the Fillmore on March 19.  Alt-country stalwart <b>Rhett Miller</b> is taking a break from his duties as the frontman for The Old 97's to tour behind his new solo album, <i>The Believer</i>.  He'll play the Gothic Theatre on March 20.<br />
<br />
Does the toddler or newborn prevent you from getting out of the house for concerts anymore?  The Boulder Theater has been providing an outlet for entertainment-starved parents with its <a href="http://www.bouldertheater.com/event_detail.php?id=334" title="Baby Loves Disco">Baby Loves Disco</a> events; the next is March 11 at 2 p.m.  It's a dance party for tykes, featuring disco songs, snacks, and socializing.<br />
<br />
And if none of these events appeal to you, you can always go see <a href="http://cc.com/detail.html?eventID=217444" title="Ann Coulter">Ann Coulter</a> at the Paramount Theatre on March 28 for an evening of—ahem—high-minded political discussion.<br />

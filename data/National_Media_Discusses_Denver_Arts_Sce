							Forget the "Mile High City," "Queen of the Plains," or "Paris on the Platte"--Paul Goldberger, architecture critic for <i>The New Yorker</i> has offered up a new slogan for Denver: A "Second-Tier City."  In the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/skyline/" title="August 28th issue">August 28th issue</a>, Goldberger discusses Daniel Libeskind's addition to the Denver Art Museum, and his review is mixed.  He praises the building for the boldness of its design and the innovation of the complex of condos and a hotel that the architect also built ("Such success is a reminder of the fact that second-tier American cities have often proved more willing to take architectural risks than supposedly sophisticated cities like New York."), but decries the odd angles that it provides as surfaces for hanging art.  Goldberger writes, "The task of making surfaces that you can actually hang paintings on has gone, instead, to Daniel Kohl, the museum’s installation designer…To the extent that Libeskind’s building is workable as a museum, it is Kohl who has made it so."<br />
<br />
In other Denver arts news, last night <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec06/theater_08-29.html" title="The News Hour on PBS profiled Denver's PHAMAly theater troupe">The News Hour on PBS profiled Denver's PHAMAly theater troupe</a>, a group of actors with physical or mental handicaps who have been performing on Denver stages for 17 years now.  The group's shows are so polished that they are reviewed by local theater critics and seen as much more than a novelty act.

		<b>Comment By Mark Phillips, 8-30-06</b>
		<p>I remember hearing Chicago referred to as "Paris on the Prarie" many times.  It's funny to me that every city (except New York...though they seem to consider London and Paris as culturally superior) seems to have a bit of an inferiority complex.  As I write this, I see a headline on the right  "Abequerque: The Next Denver".  Hah!</p>

		<p>Goldberger's observes "As for the museum’s celebrated collection of art from the American West, unlike the brash contemporary works that thrive in Libeskind’s unconventional rooms, these pieces look forlorn and out of place." What a great metaphor for the New West. This comes the closest to my concern; what, if anything are they adding to the collection, which I have always found somewhat sparse?<br />
<br />
As for the second tier comment, what isn't second tier through a New Yorker's eyes? I've lived out East and hated it, if they want to see Denver as some sort of City of Misfit Toys, then I am more than happy to be among its citizens.</p>

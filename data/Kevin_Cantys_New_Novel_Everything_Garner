							<p>The new novel <I>Everything</I>, by Missoula&#8217;s Kevin Canty, who teaches in the University of Montana writing program, has been getting some great reviews.&nbsp; Alan Cheuse praised it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128651836&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1035" title="on NPR">on NPR</a> as an &#8220;understated and affecting novel about contemporary Montana life.&#8221;  Vendela Vida, writing for the <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/books/review/Vida-t.html?_r=2" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, admired the whole book, but particularly noted its strong ending:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Unlike the endings to much of Canty&#8217;s previous work, the last pages are filled with hope. Yet Canty isn&#8217;t ignorant of the lives the characters still have to live, of the mistakes they still have to make. When I arrived at the end of &#8216;Everything,&#8217; I, too, thought: That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s it exactly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2010/08/16/100816crbn_brieflynoted1#ixzz0wsIdncOm" title="New Yorker">New Yorker</a> enjoyed it too:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Canty&#8217;s fourth novel chronicles a year&#8217;s worth of turmoil in the lives of five appealingly aimless Montanans&#8230;Canty&#8217;s urgent, at times impressionistic prose generates moment after moment of intense emotion, falling flat only occasionally, and his characters are self-aware enough to keep the story from sinking into melodrama. As their conflicts play out against the changing seasons of the increasingly encroached-upon Bitterroot Valley wilderness&#8212;with its larches, bluebirds, and streams full of rainbow trout&#8212;we come to share their bafflement at the passage of time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Okay, I&#8217;m sold.&nbsp; I need to read <I>Everything</I>.&nbsp; Hopefully I&#8217;ll review it here soon.&nbsp; Kevin Canty will be at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitiesmontana.org/BookFestival/bookfest.php" title="Montana Festival of the Book ">Montana Festival of the Book </a>from October 28 through 30.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Speaking of new novels by Montanans, Rick Bass has one coming out September 14, and it&#8217;s next up in my book stack.&nbsp; It looks like a departure from Bass&#8217;s recent work, set in the South in 1959, about a family country music group.&nbsp; Bass will discuss the book at <a target="_blank" href="http://shakespeareandco.com/" title="Shakespeare &amp; Co.">Shakespeare &amp; Co.</a> in Missoula on Monday, August 23 (7 p.m.).

&#8226; Check out Linda Coatney&#8217;s thoughtful reflections on a recent wilderness and writing retreat with Gretel Ehrlich on the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2010/08/wilderness-writing-retreat-with-gretel.html" title="Wyoming Arts Blog">Wyoming Arts Blog</a>.&nbsp; Ehrlich led a group of writers into Wyoming&#8217;s Big Horn Mountains.&nbsp; Coatney describes the first writing session of the trip:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gretel Ehrlich sits on the forest floor high in Wyoming&#8217;s Big Horn Mountains. Her bare feet socialize with a six-inch evergreen sapling, as if playing with a kitten. She&#8217;s become very attached to this little tree as she&#8217;s sat there, she tells us, her students. She urges us to study the world around us, starting with this forest floor.
</p>
<p>
&#8216;If you study a tiny ecosystem, you will understand how the whole world works,&#8217; she says. Observe and write. &#8216;Writing is the most democratic of all the arts; you don&#8217;t need to depend on anyone or anything else; just need a pencil, a piece of paper and some ideas.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

It&#8217;s difficult to resist the pull of Jennifer Woodlief&#8217;s new account of the 1982 avalanche at Alpine Meadows ski resort in California that killed seven people, however much a reader might steel himself against being drawn into another tale of humans succumbing to nature&#8217;s forces, along the lines of Krakauer&#8217;s <I>Into Thin Air</I> and Junger&#8217;s <I>The Perfect Storm</I>.&nbsp; Woodlief begins by setting the scene, describing the atmosphere at the ski area and discussing the causes of avalanches and the methods used to protect and save people from them.&nbsp; She introduces the many personalities involved, and it&#8217;s easy to guess that the people she focuses more on are going to be goners by the end of the book.&nbsp; But as the story Woodlief tells becomes fuller, a reader&#8217;s resistance is bound to drop away as the suspense reaches a thriller&#8217;s pitch.
</p>
<p>
By the time the avalanche was about to hit, I was ripping through the pages to find out what happened, and my sympathy for the victims and their families grew painfully acute.&nbsp; Woodlief&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Wall-White-Heroism-Survival-Avalanche/dp/1416546928/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239394626&amp;sr=8-1" title="A Wall of White">A Wall of White</a></I> creates an immediate, 365-degree view of the events surrounding the fatal avalanche on March 31, 1982.&nbsp; This is an impressive accomplishment, as she has managed to vividly recreate an incident that occurred 27 years ago last month.&nbsp; Woodlief is a former reporter for <I>Sports Illustrated</I> and a former case officer for the CIA, and her expert investigatory skills are on display as she pieces together the story through eyewitness recollections.
</p>
<p>
Woodlief writes, &#8220;While in 1982 the neighboring Squaw Valley ski patrol had strict rules about maintaining a clean-cut appearance, including no beards and no hair below shoulder length, the Alpine Meadows crew looked more like a biker gang.&#8221;  She goes on to introduce the endearing team of ski bums, daredevils, mountain lovers, and dedicated professionals who were working to keep patrons of the resort safe as massive amounts of snow piled up, precipitating the avalanche.&nbsp; She writes, &#8220;Alpine Meadows, presumably by design, drew a particularly extreme type of individual for its ski patrol, the kind who responded to ads posted in outdoor magazines that read along the lines of adventurous bordering on suicidal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Bernie Kingery, the mountain manager, sometimes seems like the only adult on the ski patrol, haranguing employees when they break crucial rules.&nbsp; By the end of the book the extent of Kingery&#8217;s professionalism, his dedication to the resort and to the people who worked for him is clear.&nbsp; We also get to know the fun-loving patrolman Jake Smith, who issues a last-second warning that may have cost him his life, and the vacationers who died in the avalanche, including the hard-charging, world-traveling surgeon Bud Nelson and his daughter Laura. 
</p>
<p>
Twelve-year-old Laura&#8217;s death is perhaps the hardest to take.&nbsp; Her father was stir crazy from being trapped in their cabin for days during the blizzard, and she wanted to accompany him on an expedition to the ski lodge, which led them and a companion to the resort&#8217;s parking lot at exactly the wrong moment.&nbsp; One of the resort&#8217;s employees was in the terrifying position of witnessing as the three of them were engulfed by the torrent of snow.&nbsp; Woodlief captures the emotions, confusion, and drama as everyone at the resort, along with volunteers from the community, work ceaselessly without regard to their own safety to try to save as many people as they can in the aftermath of the avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the main narrative, Woodlief&#8217;s anecdotes about avalanches are striking.&nbsp; She mentions the downhill ski racer, Buddy Werner, who tried to outrace an avalanche in Switzerland in 1964, but was caught in it and killed about 15 feet before safety.&nbsp; The most deadly avalanches occurred in Peru in 1962 and 1970, killing 4,000 and 20,000 people respectively.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
The Alpine Meadows avalanche was distinctive for several reasons.&nbsp; Woodlief writes, &#8220;The vast majority of fatal avalanches in the United States have only involved one or two victims and have been inadvertently started by those victims themselves&#8230;When someone dies in an avalanche in America, it is invariably the result of an extreme skier, snowboarder, or snowmobiler who, despite the obvious risk, can&#8217;t resist playing in the backcountry and ends up disturbing an unstable slope or cornice.&#8221;  The Alpine Meadows avalanche was not caused by humans, but by the overwhelming amount of snow piling up, and it killed seven.&nbsp; But it also was remarkable because Anna Conrad survived, buried under the snow for five days, longer than any other person rescued from an avalanche.
</p>
<p>
The dramatic rescue of Conrad maintains the suspense of <I>A Wall of White</I> right to the end.&nbsp; As ecstatic as everyone is to find a survivor after so many days of depressing toil, the road ahead for Conrad remained difficult, as she suffered permanent injuries from her ordeal.
</p>
<p>
Many of the basic details about what happened in the avalanche are given away on the book&#8217;s dust jacket, but Woodlief&#8217;s detailed, sensitive writing keeps the reader on edge to the last sentence, as you hope against hope that one more survivor will be plucked from the wreckage.&nbsp; <I>A Wall of White</I> succeeds in instilling an appreciation of the awesome force of avalanches and of the work of ski patrolmen.

		<b>Comment By David Paquette, 4-15-09</b>
		<p>I think this a very good artical. It is so compelling that draws me to want to read this book.<br />
I am a twenty year former employee of Alpine Meadows. So I can appreciate the avalanche dangers from the resort and back country. <br />
I was not there during the big avalanche of "82". I arrived in November of "85". <br />
I did witness some very huge storms during my stay and had a few up close experiences with avalanches.<br />
I am going to seek out and hopefully find this book in a library close to home, where I am living now. VT</p>

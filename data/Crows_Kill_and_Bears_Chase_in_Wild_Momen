	Most people who spend a significant amount of time in the wilderness emerge with a story of an animal sighting that was particularly vivid for them, whether it&#8217;s a glimpse of a pine martin in the forest, a close scrape with a bear or mountain lion, or an afternoon spent watching birds.&nbsp; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Moments-Adventures-Animals-North/dp/160223048X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236461562&amp;sr=8-1" title="Wild Moments: Adventures with Animals of the North">Wild Moments: Adventures with Animals of the North</a></I>, edited by Michael Engelhard, collects the best animal stories of over two-dozen writers who live, work, and adventure in the wilderness of northwest America.&nbsp; Some of them write of their experiences with a certain species over time, such as Nancy Lord&#8217;s meditation on the beluga whale, and others share one specific story, such as Daniel Henry&#8217;s unforgettable account of a crow massacre.&nbsp; The stories are divided into three sections: &#8220;Fur,&#8221; &#8220;Feathers,&#8221; and &#8220;Fins, Flukes &amp; Flippers,&#8221; and they demonstrate how encounters with animals in the wild can give meaning to people&#8217;s lives.
</p>
<p>
	Daniel Henry&#8217;s story, &#8220;A Murder of Crows,&#8221; sticks out because it&#8217;s so bizarre and violent.&nbsp; Henry was working at retreat for the Young Adult Conservation Corps on False Island, &#8220;forty miles north of Sitka, Alaska, as the crow flies.&#8221;  Like something out of Hitchcock, crows begin to gather near the camp, until their &#8220;raucous symphony builds to a stadium roar on the third day.&#8221;  No one can sleep through the cacophony, and everything is covered in bird droppings.&nbsp; Suddenly, after an inexplicable hush falls over the crows, &#8220;Pandemonium roars from the stand of old trees,&#8221; and when Henry and others investigate, they find &#8220;a hell-fight beyond our imagination.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s how he describes the apocalyptic scene:
</p>
<blockquote><p>	&#8220;Bodies rain from the trees.&nbsp; Dying birds hit the forest floor screaming&#8230;Their black breasts&#8217; normal gloss fades under blood and duff, pierced to the heart by beaks bearing ancient regards.&nbsp; We watch with grotesque fascination as silent cries issue from the twisting jaws of birds whose heads are attached to their bodies only by a strand of sinew.&nbsp; Many of the feathered shadows writhing on the ground are composed of two or three crows pinned to each other by their beaks and claws.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
	The carnage stops eventually, leaving bird carcasses piled two feet deep.&nbsp; By a few days after the crow massacre, other animals have cleaned up the scene.&nbsp; The only thing missing from Henry&#8217;s riveting account was a little scientific background information&#8212;do crows normally do this sort of thing?&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; But &#8220;Murder of Crows&#8221; is a great story that should earn Henry free beers for life at any bar he tells it in.
</p>
<p>
	Another harrowing story is Ned Rozell&#8217;s &#8220;Things That Go Bump.&#8221;  He&#8217;s excited to be left alone to spend eight days in a cabin in the Yukon, until a grizzly gets a little too familiar.&nbsp; Rozell sets out in a canoe to scout for moose for his hunting clients, and the grizzly begins to chase him.&nbsp; &#8220;I was motoring upstream in a seventeen-foot canoe, losing a race to a bear galloping through cottongrass like a thoroughbred.&nbsp; Twisting the throttle, I looked to my left and watched the bear, all rolling muscle and determination, with just five yards of muddy water between us.&#8221;  The bear eventually ends the chase, but Rozell must spend the night clutching his gun inside the cabin that the bear has entered before.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the stories in <I>Wild Moments</I> offer more contemplative experiences with nature.&nbsp; I especially enjoyed Nancy Lord&#8217;s &#8220;Watching,&#8221; her reflections on beluga whales in Alaska&#8217;s Cook Inlet.&nbsp; She can&#8217;t get a complete glimpse of the whales as they travel through the water, each on looking like &#8220;a wheel, a round white disk churning the sea.&#8221;  She tries to learn more about them, but belugas haven&#8217;t been studied much, and Lord decides, &#8220;I liked that I lived with mystery whales.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Sometimes animal encounters offer people the inspiration that they need to go on living, as in Jo-Ann Mapson&#8217;s &#8220;Gandalf the Great Gray.&#8221;  Mapson became interested in the owls of Alaska just as the autoimmune disease she&#8217;s suffering from flares up.&nbsp; She wanted to volunteer at a bird rehabilitation center, but her condition makes it too painful.&nbsp; Mapson still manages to teach a writing course, and decides a visit with an owl from the rehabilitation center is just what she and the students need for inspiration.&nbsp; A volunteer brings Gandalf the Great Gray owl into the classroom, and though his wingspan and bearing are initially impressive, Mapson notices that &#8220;beaneath the plumage and talons and brilliant yellow eyes&#8221; the owl&#8217;s body is actually quite small.&nbsp; &#8220;It reminded me that in small things, we often find our deepest lessons&#8230;Flight, I realized, is as much a feat of the mind as it is of the body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	The stories about whales especially convey the magic of encounters with animals, such as in Loretto Jones&#8217; &#8220;Once Upon a Whale,&#8221; and James Michael Dorsey&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Storm.&#8221;  Jones is diving for abalone in Alaskan waters when she gets a radio call about a humpback whale caught in a net nearby.&nbsp; At first she is reluctant to risk her own life to save the whale, but then she recalls a near-drowning experience she had and resolves to try to save the whale from that fate.&nbsp; She cuts a cork out of the whale&#8217;s blowhole and with difficulty, frees it from the nets.&nbsp; James Michael Dorsey writes of his encounter with killer whales when he was paddling in Alaska&#8217;s Inside Passage.&nbsp; He becomes caught up in a killer whale pod&#8217;s salmon-eating feeding frenzy, and at the end the enormous leader of the pod meets his gaze and swims alongside him until Dorsey tires of paddling, realizing, &#8220;I am still alive not by accident.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	The stories in <I>Wild Moments</I> convey the wonder, beauty, drama, and peril that encounters with animals in the wild can bring.

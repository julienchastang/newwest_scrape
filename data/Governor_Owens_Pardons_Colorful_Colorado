							In his final State of the State speech yesterday, Governor Bill Owens addressed an issue that has obviously been on the minds of a lot of Coloradoans: "My pledge to the legislature is this.  If you work with me on helping tourism, I'll cancel plans for those new 'Welcome to Colorado' signs and we'll keep the 'Colorful Colorado' signs."  According to the <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/government/article/0,2777,DRMN_23906_4385231,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>, this line got a big laugh.  But the issue was no laughing matter for some of us.  I previously wrote about how miffed I was over the pending change (<a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/4967/" title=""Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Colorful Colorado' Signs"">"Bad Design to Replace Historic 'Colorful Colorado' Signs"</a>) and others felt the same way (<a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/5030/" title=""Beating Back the New 'Welcome to Colorado' Sign"">"Beating Back the New 'Welcome to Colorado' Sign"</a>).  Governor Owen's statement not only serves as a promise to preserve a beloved symbol of Colorado, but it also provides proof that the Governor actually pays attention to the emails he receives.

		<p>Jenny, thanks for your posts abou this issue. I think that our culture's new interest in design and blog like NewWest and &lt;a &gt;my own&lt;/a&gt; helped to turn this into an issue that the State couldn't ignore.</p>

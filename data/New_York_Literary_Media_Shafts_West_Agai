							I remember vividly the first time I encountered <i>The New Yorker</i> in my senior English class in a Denver public high school.  My teacher announced at the beginning of the year that we would each be given a copy of <i>The New Yorker</i> every Friday, which we would be allowed to peruse for half of the class and then weâ€™d write a short essay on one of the articles. Incredibly, the magazine was ours to keep, an unaccustomed boon for students in a woefully under-funded school district.  I donâ€™t think many of my classmatesâ€™ copies ever made it past the trashcans in the hallwayâ€”the consensus was that the magazine was boring, snooty, and irrelevant with almost no pictures apart from undecipherable cartoonsâ€”but I took my New Yorkers home and hoarded them under my bed.  Iâ€™d never seen anything like <i>The New Yorker</i>, full of literate, witty articles about a faraway worldâ€”the East Coastâ€”with a short story in every issue, a delight I hadnâ€™t encountered in any of the magazines my parents subscribed to. <br />
<br />
Despite choosing to live in the state where I grew up, ever since then Iâ€™ve maintained a steady New York literary media diet, subscribing to <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, and the New York-based <i>Poets & Writers</i> over the years.  Whenever one of these publications includes a mention of Colorado or the West, I read the article eagerly, hoping to see my home accurately portrayed and the regionâ€™s authors fairly judged, but usually I am disappointed, as I was by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/main/magazine/" title="Jonathan Franzenâ€™s essay, â€œMy Bird Problem,â€? in the August 8 & 15 <i>New Yorker</i>.">Jonathan Franzenâ€™s essay, â€œMy Bird Problem,â€? in the August 8 & 15 <i>New Yorker</i>.</a><br />
<br />
Franzenâ€™s essay isnâ€™t about Colorado per seâ€”it focuses on his growing concern about the environment and the dissolution of his first marriageâ€”but Iâ€™m a Coloradoan, so the brief mentions of my state are the most important part for me.  What local insight did I glean from the literary master?  Weâ€™ve disappointed him, it seems.  In 1990, Franzen separated from his wife and she moved to Colorado Springs. â€œBy fleeing to the land of open skies,â€? he writes, â€œmy wife hoped to restore her independent nature.â€?  He writes of her reading habits: â€œShe became fascinated with narratives of pioneer womenâ€”tough, oppressed, resourceful wives who buried dead infants, watched freak June blizzards kill their crops and livestock, and survived to write about it.â€?  <br />
<br />
Franzen visits Colorado, hoping to patch up the relationship, but is not impressed with what he sees, which doesnâ€™t match his childhood fantasies of the West: â€œEvery crest in the open road opened up new vistas of irrigation-intensive monoculture, mining-scarred hillsides, and parking lots full of nature loversâ€™ cars.â€?  But thereâ€™s moreâ€”when he and his wife examined eleven different places where they might move, including Boulder and Santa Fe, they found â€œthings to fault in each of them.â€?  Is this what the Rocky Mountain region has become to the rest of the countryâ€”a place for East Coast types to visit and find lacking when compared to the myths they carry around in their minds, and then use the disenchantment they experience as the fodder to generate a <i>New Yorker</i> essay?  I guess I shouldnâ€™t be too upset about the New York-centric views of the magazine; after all, itâ€™s called <i>The New Yorker</i>.  Still, itâ€™s unfortunate that all of the most powerful forces in Americaâ€™s literary culture share this East Coast outlook.<br />
<br />
Even more annoying than Coloradoâ€™s dismissal by Franzen, who is already hated by thousands as The Guy Who Ruined Oprahâ€™s Book Club For Everyone, is the review treatment that books of some Western writers receive by the <i>New York Times</i>, whose Sunday book section is, for better or worse, the book review of record.  Most often, the <i>Book Review</i> ignores Western writers altogetherâ€”but occasionally it pays them attention of the most condescending sort.  Nothing was worse in this respect than <a target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DA1F3CF930A15756C0A9629C8B63" title="Jonathan Miles' review">Jonathan Miles' review</a> of Kent Harufâ€™s <i>Eventide</i> (the follow-up to National Book Award-nominated <i>Plainsong</i>) which ran in the <i>Book Review</i> last May.  <br />
<br />
Miles began with this snide opening: â€œI can't support this with demographic particulars, but here goes: many of the same readers who were drawn to Kent Haruf's best-selling novel, <i>Plainsong</i>, are equally drawn to Pottery Barn furniture.â€?  The review grew more unfair from thereâ€”Miles quoted statements from the prose in a Pottery Barn catalogue that he claimed were applicable to Harufâ€™s work, and because he couldnâ€™t understand how a book set in rural Colorado could become nationally popular on its own merits, he offered this specious theory: â€œLike antique reproductions, 'alternativeâ€™ country music and the Slow Food movement, <i>Plainsong</i> was a life raft for people who felt they were drowning in the sour froth of pop cynicism.â€?  By â€œpeople,â€? he clearly meant â€œNew Yorkers,â€? because all the Coloradoans I know who read <i>Plainsong</i> found it to be a literary blessing of the simplest sort: A believable, moving representation of life in the state they call home. For the record, I loved <i>Eventide</i>, and said so in my review for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insidedenver.com/drmn/books/article/0,1299,DRMN_63_2863170,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>.<br />
<br />
The problem is, many, many more bookish people read <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> than read any of the book reviews that are generated in the West.  And the review problem further exacerbates the publication problemâ€”the publishing industry, based in New York, seems less likely to publish the work of Western writers than East Coast writers, in part because they must think Western books wonâ€™t sell as well.  And itâ€™s true, they wonâ€™t, if they arenâ€™t able to grab any attention from the East Coast media juggernaut that drives the sales of books.  <br />
<br />
Iâ€™m not canceling my subscription to <i>The New Yorker</i> or the <i>Book Review</i>, but I canâ€™t help but wish there were some way for Western literature to gain equal, fair representation in the national media.  Until that happens, meet me out on the range somewhereâ€”over the campfire, Iâ€™ll tell you which books are the good ones.

		<b>Comment By Lenit, 8-15-05</b>
		<p>After spending most of my life in the East, I was surprised to find, when I moved a four days' drive West, that what goes on out here isn't as irrelevant as I'd always assumed... Although I admit that New York art/literature/culture will always be the standard by which I judge what is created here.  I know it's not right, but it will always be my instinct.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Joan Opyr, 8-15-05</b>
		<p>I have a Manhattan literary agent I love -- but perhaps that's because she's originally from California.  New York and, indeed, the rest of the Eastern establishment simply does not get Western literature.  They don't get Judy Blunt; they don't get Mary Clearman Blew; they don't get Sherman Alexie.  The New Yorker and the New York Times Book Review can't tell the difference between Vardis Fisher and Louis L'Amour.  It's long since time that writers in the West stopped looking to the New York literary establishment for approval and/or affirmation.  We Westerners know what we're doing.  We know the importance of our region and the strength of our writers, and we know the value of our mixed, diverse history and culture.<br />
<br />
Great piece, Jenny.  I'm forwarding this to my agent and to other friends in New York (and Boston and Raleigh and DC).  The New Yorker pretends to understand Southern literature; perhaps they'll soon pretend to get ours.  In the meantime, however, why hold our collective breaths?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Courtney Lowery, 8-15-05</b>
		<p>The East Coast media doesn't send their reporters to the West, they send out foreign correspondents -- as if we're a third-world country, battling only bears and open container laws.<br />
 <br />
Great piece Jenny.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Emily Esterson, 8-16-05</b>
		<p>Years ago, frantic to leave the hustle of Boston, I proposed to a  large and respected business magazine for which I worked that they allow me to move back to the Rockies where I could dig up interesting stories from the field. I hardly saw my editors anyway, and they were always looking for stories from "out there." They thought I was nuts. Suffice it to say I quit. <br />
<br />
I'd like to ask though, what, exactly, "our genre" of literature is- Is it Louis L'Amour? Or Gretel Erlich? Or Mark Spragg? Or Ivan Doig? Or Tony Hillerman? Such genres are hard to define, I think. Still, my thought on this is that someone has to hit it big, and then it becomes the next "it" thing in New York. Hispanic lit is an example: it is the "it" thing right now.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Clayton, 8-16-05</b>
		<p>Jonathan Miles also gave a brutally unfair review to Mark Spragg. Maybe part of the problem is the reviewers NYTBR assigns?<br />
<br />
This issue is one reason I really liked New West's weekly book review roundup that ran for a few weeks in early summer. Any chance you could bring that back?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Patrick Farrell, 8-16-05</b>
		<p>Yes, the New Yorker is East Coast centric but quite a few of it's golden stable of writers make the west their homes.  <br />
<br />
Sherman Alexie gets stories published in the New Yorker-one of his best "What you pawn I will redeem" ran in last year's fiction issue. Ian Frazier, one the mag's venerable humor columnists used to live in Montana and had much of his "Great Plains" book serialized in its pages before it was a book.  Annie Proulx's fiction, as western as it gets, gets regular play as well.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to be bet most easterners know what they know about the west, particularly its people, from the pages of magazines like the New Yorker.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about Franzen.  He's no more an east coaster than I am a westerner.  We both hail from that great flat expanse known as the heartland.  Franzen grew up in Illinois.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jonathan Weber, 8-16-05</b>
		<p>John, regarding the book review round-up, I'll check in with Allen Jones on that. I think he got frustrated with the relative paucity of interesting reviews but I will ask him about it again.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael L. Umphrey, 8-17-05</b>
		<p>For years I read the New Yorker, and now it's been years since I have read it. I don't know whether the West has diverged in its development as much from the East Coast as the American colonies had diverged from Britain in, say, 1770. <br />
<br />
But I know I've grown to mind hardly at all the way people on the East Coast tend to pay little attention to what life out here is like. I often wish they would pay even less attention. <br />
<br />
We have possiblities open to us that are exceedingly unlikely back there in that old, overdeveloped, hyper-sophisticated cultural capital of a different era.<br />
<br />
It's more fun to contemplate the future of this place that feels so young than it is to wonder how to get the attention of the New Yorker. I quite like New West, which I do read.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Paula Younger, 8-17-05</b>
		<p>Now I have another reason to detest Franzen, as if Oprah's book club and his arrogant attitude were not enough. I still have not been able to read The Corrections, and this will only make it more difficult. Sadly, Jenny's well-written article is on target. As a Colorado kid now living in NY and working at an agent's office, I see how little they care or know about the west. Most New Yorkers in general are only aware of the east coast and CA; they have no idea about the other states and don't care (huge generalizations, I know). My grandma likes to say that we know more about them (New Yorkers) than they know about us (meaning people in the West). It's true. <br />
<br />
I have had east coast friends pooh pooh the West for their treatment of the environment and their policies. While I am an environmentalist and want everyone, including westerners, to take care of the land, it strikes me as arrogant and simple to make this claim. As if east coasters didn't do damage to their environment long ago. It's just like people in developing countries - they want to be economically viable and will do damage to their beautiful natural world to do it. That's why CO has mine scarred hills, etc. The West and its mountains are beautiful, but it isn't Eden. Human beings have been living there and have the same motivations as people in all parts of the country.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By John Clayton, 10-25-05</b>
		<p>Paula, if you would email me backchannel, I may have an interesting book proposal for you...</p>

In happier news, a woman gave birth to her baby at the Denver Public Library last Tuesday.&nbsp; The 18-year-old mother, Dominique Trevino, was riding the bus to the hospital when the baby&#8217;s arrival became imminent.&nbsp; A fellow passenger advised her to get off the bus and go into the library while she called for an ambulance. Sariah Unique Trevino entered the world just minutes later in the library, weighing 5 pounds, 12 ounces.&nbsp; According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/27/baby-girl-born-main-denver-public-library/?partner=RSS" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Library staff pitched in to buy a bag full of children&#8217;s books for Sariah, which Thomas Scott, director of security and safety, presented to Trevino at Wednesday&#8217;s news conference.&nbsp; He also gave her an earth-friendly library totebag with two unactivated library cards inside &#8212; one for mom, who said she&#8217;s not a big reader, and one for baby.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Ms. Trevino isn&#8217;t the only one visiting the library these days.&nbsp; According to Julie Hutchison&#8217;s report for the Rocky Mountain News, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/feb/02/throngs-checking-out-library/" title="libraries in the Denver area are thronged">libraries in the Denver area are thronged</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the patrons don&#8217;t seem to be there to check out literary classics.&nbsp; Patti Bateman, the manager of library services for an Aurora library told Hutchinson that among the people who flood in when the library opens each morning, &#8220;A lot of them are looking for jobs, trying to learn to fill out applications online. Others are trying to figure how to file for unemployment.&#8221;

Colorado&#8217;s fiscal problems will curtail the budget of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloarts.org/" title="Colorado Council on the Arts">Colorado Council on the Arts</a> this year, cutting it by 50%, which will result in a postponement of this year&#8217;s grants to artists and organizations.&nbsp; The Council is launching a &#8220;listening tour&#8221; from January 30 through February 10 throughout Colorado to seek input on what programs the remaining funds should be dedicated to.&nbsp; Details about the meetings are available on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloarts.org/news/releases/pressrelease_1-23-09.html" title="the Council's website.">the Council&#8217;s website.</a>  Prospective attendees for the February 9 meeting in Montrose are advised: &#8220;Brown Bag lunches welcome.

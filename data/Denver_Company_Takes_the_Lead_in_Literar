							The annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com" title="BookExpo America">BookExpo America</a> brought a flurry of literary activity to Washington, D.C. last weekend as publishers, editors, and authors gathered at the largest book trade convention in the U.S.  But the bookish fun isn't over yet: BookExpo America hired the Denver company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.burstmarketing.com" title="BurstMarketing">BurstMarketing</a> to provide podcasts of the speakers at this year's event, and average Joes and publishing industry insiders alike can listen to the free podcasts at <a target="_blank" href="http://bookexpocast.com/" title="BookExpoCast.com">BookExpoCast.com</a>.  The first podcast, the "Opening Night Keynote with Tim Russert," is available now, and beginning this week BurstMarketing will periodically release up to two-dozen podcasts.  Those who don't want to miss any of the action can sign up to receive the podcasts as they become available.  Future topics include business-focused podcasts such as "The Best Way to Leverage Podcasting" and "The Best Way to Exploit RSS Technology," and more literary recordings, such as the "Saturday Book and Author Luncheon."<br />
<br />
BurstMarketing is also behind the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.authorsontourlive.com/" title="Authors on Tour--Live">Authors on Tour--Live</a> podcast show that is regulary recorded at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tatteredcover.com" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a>.  Notable recent podcasts available from the service include readings and discussion by <a target="_blank" href="http://authorsontourlive.com/?p=39" title="Joan Didion">Joan Didion</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://authorsontourlive.com/?p=36" title="Lemony Snicket">Lemony Snicket</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://authorsontourlive.com/?p=27" title="Zadie Smith">Zadie Smith</a>.<br />
<br />
Why is BurstMarketing so interested in making free literary chatter accessible to anyone with internet access?  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.burstmarketing.com/aboutUs.php" title="The company's homepage">The company's homepage</a> doesn't list any specifics, but notes that among its employees are some who "wrote and published novels and non-fiction work."

Twice Upon a Time sells new and used books, and according to the article, &#8220;customers travel from a 150-mile radius, including Moab and Price, Utah, the Four Corners region, Glenwood Springs, Meeker and Craig. Out-of-town business has doubled since the store was purchased in September 2007.&nbsp; &#8216;Our out-of-town customers stock up like it&#8217;s milk and bread,&#8217; Wilson said.&#8221;

But that&#8217;s okay, because he picked up a few other honors recently&#8212;his story &#8220;Goats,&#8221; (one of my favorites from his most recent collection), appeared in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boisestate.edu/theidahoreview/" title="the Idaho Review">the Idaho Review</a> and was selected for inclusion in two prize anthologies, &#8220;Pushcart Prize: Best of the Small Presses 2008&#8221; and &#8220;New Stories from the South 2008.&#8221;

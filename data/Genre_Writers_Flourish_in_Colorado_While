							<p>Mark Graham wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5733070,00.html" title="a nice profile">a nice profile</a> of prize-winning science fiction writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Wellesley/5595/willis/willis.html" title="Connie Willis">Connie Willis</a> for the Rocky Mountain News this week.&nbsp; Willis, who lives in Greeley, boasts a crowded trophy shelf filled with rocket-shaped Hugo Awards and &#8220;nebulae&#8221; Nebula Awards.&nbsp; Graham describes her as &#8220;one of the most honored science fiction writers of all time,&#8221; and cites the astonishing fact that Willis has won more of the aforementioned awards than sci-fi heavyweights such as Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke.
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s Willis&#8217; secret?&nbsp; She seems to have a champion work ethic, for one thing.&nbsp; According to Graham, she starts out her mornings working at a coffee shop or the Student Center of UNC (where her husband is a professor), takes a break for lunch, and gets back at it in the afternoon.&nbsp; Willis told Graham, &#8220;My life has to be a pretty solitary life,&#8221; in order to sustain her prolific output.
</p>
<p>
This profile made me ponder a regional literary phenomenon--Colorado seems to be packed with talented genre writers, such as Willis, mystery writers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.margaretcoel.com/" title="Margaret Coel">Margaret Coel</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dianemottdavidson.com/" title="Diane Mott Davidson">Diane Mott Davidson</a>, John Dunning, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.authorstephenwhite.com/" title="Stephen White">Stephen White</a>, and thriller writer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jefflongbooks.com/" title="Jeff Long">Jeff Long</a>, but the state seems to lack high-profile literary fiction writers, especially when you compare it to Montana.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
While literary fiction set in Montana abounds, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Haruf" title="Kent Haruf">Kent Haruf</a> is one of the few literary novelists I can think of who both lives in Colorado and sets his fiction here.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arynkyle.com/" title="Aryn Kyle">Aryn Kyle</a>, who grew up in Grand Junction, published a great Colorado-based novel this year, <I>The God of Animals</I>, but now lives in--you guessed it--Montana.&nbsp; Is there something in the water that makes genre books more likely to pop up here and the literary ones take root farther north in the Rockies?&nbsp; I&#8217;d appreciate hearing people&#8217;s theories on this.

A few weeks ago, Dwight Garner at the New York Times&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com" title="Paper Cuts">Paper Cuts</a> blog ran <a target="_blank" href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/stray-questions-for-maile-meloy/index.html?ex=1349841600&amp;en=ecde78c48cfdcafc&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" title="a short interview">a short interview</a> with Maile Meloy, a great literary fiction writer who grew up in Montana (of course!).&nbsp; Meloy reveals that she&#8217;s working on a collection of short stories and usually finds her books shelved in bookstores between Larry McMurtry and Melville.&nbsp; If any contemporary writer can hold her own between those two, it&#8217;s Meloy.
</p>
<p>
And the Washington Post recently launched a book blog of its own, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/shortstack" title="Short Stack">Short Stack</a>.&nbsp; One of <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/shortstack/2007/10/a_short_stack_of_books_on_how.html" title="the first posts was by Rachel Shea">the first posts was by Rachel Shea</a>, who wrote, &#8220;As the sole Westerner on the Book World staff, I feel geographically obligated to highlight some of my favorite novels about the settling of the West.&#8221;  She picked <I>Blood Meridian</I> by Cormac McCarthy (1985), <I>A Sudden Country</I> by Karen Fisher (2005), <I>Angle of Repose</I> by Wallace Stegner (1971), <I> Lonesome Dove</I> by Larry McMurtry (1985), and <I>The Ox-Bow Incident</I> by Walter van Tilburg Clark (1940) as her top five western books.

		<p>Northern Colorado's Laura Pritchett comes to mind as a literary novelist with deep roots in her homeland...I have yet to read her new novel but the stories in Hell's Bottom, Colorado make it one of my personal favorites in a booming collection of writers of the West. She has the potential to be an extraordinary literary writer/storyteller. As for theories... what role did the writing program at Missoula play?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 10-31-07</b>
		<p>Laura Pritchett is a great writer to mention--I've enjoyed several of her books and have reviewed them for NewWest in the past.  There's also Pam Houston, who lives in Creede for at least part of the year and frequently sets fiction in Colorado.  And there are several literary writers who live in Colorado, but haven't yet set their fiction here, such as Denver's Nick Arvin.  My interview with him will run next week.<br />
<br />
But the excellent writing program at Missoula is a good basis for a theory--so many great writers teach there or studied there: Deirdre McNamer, Kevin Canty, and Judy Blunt, to name a few.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 11-01-07</b>
		<p>I look forward to the interview with Nick Arvin. Thanks to you, I read the News' article on Pam Houston in Creede and the duality of her need for Creede (sorry) and the land and animals who are essential to her wholeness while still struggling with loneliness and isolation for other human connections. Very interesting. Anyway, our few examples still seem to be the exception that proves the rule and your original point. However, is it not possible that Jenny Shank might add to Colorado's literary canon?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tom Miller, 11-01-07</b>
		<p>Another literary split in the West, this one in Arizona: genre writers congregate north of the Gila River in the Phoenix region, literary writers hang out south of the Gila in the Tucson area. To complicate this a tad and give it some metaphoric heft, the Gila River is dry just about year â€˜round. Go figure.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Heather, 11-02-07</b>
		<p>Have you read Robert O. Greer's CJ Floyd mysteries set in Denver and throughout Colorado? They are wonderful. Dr. Greer is a pathology at CO Health Sciences. I like CJ Floyd because is he African American, a bailbonds man and he talks about Denver's African American community in the books.<br />
<br />
I live in Montana and Denver, so I really liked this article of yours. Thanks.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-02-07</b>
		<p>Tom, that's uncanny that Arizona writers have divided themselves on either side of a rather inactive geological feature.  Perhaps they made some sort of secret pact?  Maybe you should try writing some fiction in addition to all the great nonfiction books you've written: you could see if the writing just comes out one way or the other, genre or literary, depending on which side of the river you're on.<br />
<br />
And Heather, thanks for the tip about Greer's books.  I haven't read any of them yet, but now I'd like to because I can just picture that strip of brightly painted bail-bond houses near the police headquarters in Denver, and it seems like the perfect setting for fiction.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 11-02-07</b>
		<p>Wyoming feeds on the meaty literary vibes that emanate from the University of Montana writing program. We Wyomingites, starved for literariness, have perfected the process of absorbing those emanations and injecting them into our own work. The few lit-vibes that do make it down to Colorado are anemic, shadows of their Montana-bred selves. Writers in Greeley and Fort Collins are left with only a smattering of inventiveness, a smidgen of creativity. They must turn to sci-fi and mysteries, even romance.</p>

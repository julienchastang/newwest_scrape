							In case you missed the huge, front page photo in yesterdayâ€™s <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, the July 18 AP report that was picked up by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/19/AR2005071900607.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> among other outlets, the segments on virtually every Colorado television news outfit and the ongoing, in-depth coverage by the <i>Greeley Tribune</i>: This summer, Greeley residents have been victimized by a rash of garden gnome-nappings.  It took all my powers of restraint to resist spelling that â€œgnome-gnappings.â€?  Reporters, apparently starved for occasions to pun, are gleefully jesting about the gnomes, sometimes deploying multiple puns in one sentence, as Ivan Moreno did in the lead of his July 19 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/state/article/0,1299,DRMN_21_3937073,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> piece, writing, â€œPerhaps it was a lack of gnomeland security that pushed Elsie Schnorr into the ranks of Greeleyâ€™s gnomeless.â€?  Indeed.<br />
<br />
For those late to the garden gnome storyâ€”which has legs, lots of tiny legs (sorry!)â€”here is a recap: According to a June 7 article by Mike Peters of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050607/NEWS/106070063&SearchID=73214666085342&template=printart" title="Greeley Tribune">Greeley Tribune</a>, â€œGnarly Gnome-Gnappers strike twice,â€? one of the first incidents was reported by Elsie Schnorr, a 72-year-old Weld County resident who had 16 of her 30 garden gnomes stolen the night of May 31.  She was victimized again two days later when thieves returned to collect the remaining 14. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/article/20050610/NEWS/106100077&SearchID=73211142880328" title="June 10 article">June 10 article</a>, Peters speculated that the thefts were inspired by the movie <i>Amelie</i>, reported the June 9 theft of 10 of Tammy Johnsonâ€™s gnomes, and interviewed Undersheriff Margie Martinez, who issued the extremely Rumsfeldian statement, â€œWe have no known gnome suspects.â€?<br />
<br />
Petersâ€™ reports on these incident generated so many comments on the Tribuneâ€™s website that on June 12, they ran an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050612/NEWS/106120043&SearchID=73214666014124&template=printart" title="article recapping these responses">article recapping these responses</a>, which ranged from readers creating their own cryptic tongue-twisters (â€œThe Gnome of Rome stays mainly homeâ€?) to calling for the end to displaying garden gnomes on religious grounds (â€œPut an end to tacky lawn ornaments. . .Thou shall not worship graven imagesâ€?) to a claim of responsibility by a group calling itself the â€œGnome Liberation Front.â€?  A Google search for the group yields a <a target="_blank" href="http://internettrash.com/users/sprkythdvl/gnome.htm" title="mysterious website">mysterious website</a> calling for people to liberate â€œGnomekind everywhereâ€? and to send photos of any stolen gnomes to the site.<br />
<br />
Next, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050618/TRIBEDIT/106180045&SearchID=73214665937798&template=printart" title="Peters reported">Peters reported</a> that an â€œabused gnomeâ€? had been returned to Tammy Johnsonâ€™s lawn on June 13: â€œIts eyes had been blackened with ink, there were bandages on its head, its arm was in a sling and one foot was covered with bandages.â€?  Attached was a note addressed to the <i>Tribune</i> writer: â€œBack off Mike Peters.  This is getting ugly.  Beware.  Hee, hee.â€? Peters, who has become the Bob Woodward of the story, wrote a column declaring to the gnome-nappers, â€œI ainâ€™t scared of you.â€? On <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050618/NEWS/106180047&SearchID=73214665754833&template=printart" title="June 18">June 18</a>, he reported that a Greeley woman found dozens of discarded, broken garden gnomes in the dumpsters behind the Bittersweet Plaza shopping center.<br />
<br />
Finally, on Saturday, July 16, there was a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greeleytrib.com/article/20050717/NEWS/107170061" title="break in the case">break in the case</a>.  Police responding to a tip discovered 80 gnomes in black plastic bags at a Greeley home.  A bunch of kids found the gnomes, but they are not suspects in the case, and the police have not announced any suspects yet.  But, most importantly, victims of gnome theft are now able to fill out claim forms and come to the Greeley police department to recover their property.  With many of the gnomes safely home, Colorado media may be able to move on to other stories now.

		<p>I gotta tell you, I've been fascinated by this phe-gnome-enon for a long time. A few years ago, the gnome snatchers hit Missoula and never have I had so much fun with a story. This one is just as good.</p>

							<p>Every city has its own array of used car salesmen who deploy low-budget commercials of questionable taste on the local airwaves, showcasing the dealership&#8217;s owner dressed as a chicken or Uncle Sam, say.&nbsp; Often one such dealership rises to prominence in the hearts and minds of the people based on the extremes of bad taste to which their commercials sink.&nbsp; In Denver, this role is filled by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockysautos.com/contact.php" title="Rocky's Autos">Rocky&#8217;s Autos</a>, a Westminster-based company that has long kept area audiences enthralled with its TV ads featuring three regular dramatis personae: a perky, petite, white woman (Audra Winn), and a tall black man dressed as a police officer (Odell Straud) who serve as the comic foils for a goofy Latino, Shaggy or Shagman (Ron Vigil).&nbsp; Shaggy has done some outrageous things in his day, but the new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockysautos.com/commercials.php" title="Stock Show Horse Pill">Stock Show Horse Pill</a> commercial finds him plumbing new depths.
</p>
<p>
The commercial opens with Shaggy and Officer Odell standing in a barn beside a small brown pony.&nbsp; Shaggy announces that this is &#8220;my little draft horsey.&#8221;  Officer Odell counters, &#8220;But draft horses are supposed to be huge!&#8221;  Shaggy takes out a large orange pill and says, &#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve got this vitamin.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll be ready for the draft horse show in no time.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
The commercial cuts to a stock show scene, and provides some information about Rocky&#8217;s Autos&#8217; sponsorship of the draft horse show.&nbsp; Then it cuts back to the barn, where Shaggy prepares to administer the pill, stepping behind the pony.&nbsp; There is a lurid closeup of the pony&#8217;s shocked face while Officer Odell yells, &#8220;Shaggy!&nbsp; It&#8217;s supposed to go in his mouth!&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
The camera angle widens to show Shaggy removing his hand from the pony&#8217;s back side, exulting, &#8220;Ah, success!&#8221;  Yes, that&#8217;s right: This is a commercial featuring the anal administration of a vitamin pill to a horse.&nbsp; But it doesn&#8217;t end there.&nbsp; In the final scene, Shaggy pops up in a window in the corner and licks the finger that just pushed the pill into the horse&#8217;s anus.
</p>
<p>
If this doesn&#8217;t sell cars, nothing will.&nbsp; In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4988654" title="a recent Denver Post article">a recent Denver Post article</a> about the Rocky&#8217;s Autos booth at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalwestern.com/" title="National Western Stock Show">National Western Stock Show</a>, Vigil noted that Shagman appeals to &#8220;children and older adults.&#8221;  This commercial should give those children plenty of questions to ask the older adults.

		<p>Wow.  That’s definitely a new low for them.  Sadly though, I think their target demographic might appreciate this type of “humor.”  <br />
<br />
Worse yet, be reminded that someone actualy got paid to develop the creative for that ad spot.  That’s even more depressing.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sellers, 2-10-07</b>
		<p>By printing this article and commenting on the spot itself, you just fell for the oldest ad trick in the book....you gave them more attention.  It's always easy to be a backseat driver, or monday morning quarterback.  The real trick is to come up with something that's just as creative or memorable......if you don't like the spot, just wait a week.<br />
<br />
Let's see if YOUR output is as diverse!!!!</p>

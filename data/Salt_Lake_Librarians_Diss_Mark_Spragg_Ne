							<p>Whether or not community reading programs actually spur people to read, there&#8217;s one thing to be said for them: They certainly get people riled up over books.&nbsp; On Friday, Lucinda Dillon Kinkead at the <a target="_blank" href="http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660207422,00.html" title="DesertNews">DesertNews</a> brought to light an intra-Rocky Mountain West book brouhaha.&nbsp; In one corner is Wyoming author Mark Spragg, whose 2004 novel <i>An Unfinished Life</i> was selected in January for Salt Lake County&#8217;s &#8220;One County, One Book&#8221; reading program.&nbsp; In the other corner are the Salt Lake County librarians who recently unceremoniously de-selected Spragg&#8217;s book and dis-invited him from the October event that was to be held in his honor.&nbsp; The only explanation Kinkead&#8217;s sources offered her was that &#8220;at least one local librarian found rough language in the book objectionable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The literary blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/salt_lake_county_rescinds_book_selection_author_invitation_56141.asp?c=rss" title="GalleyCat ">GalleyCat </a>notes, &#8220;Spragg says - and sources close to the details privately confirm - there was scrutiny from library system officials about rough scenes in the book involving a character named Roy, who is a violent person, a batterer and uses obscene language.&#8221;
<br />
 
<br />
It gets uglier: Kinkead writes, &#8220;One bookseller with contacts in the publishing business said a New York literary agent told her Salt Lake City is the &#8216;laughing stock&#8217; of the publishing world.&#8221;  I can just picture a group of literary types snickering over cocktails in Manhattan: &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe she published that book.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so <i>Salt Lake</i>.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
I read <i>An Unfinished Life</i> a few years ago, and I have no memory of any particularly rough language or shocking violence.&nbsp; I think long-term memory of such things is as good measurement as any of the scenes&#8217; intensity (After many years, for example, I still remember certain racy passages in <I>Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow</I> and <I>The Naked Lunch</I>).&nbsp; It&#8217;s the same thing with Kent Haruf&#8217;s wonderful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/salt_lake_county_rescinds_book_selection_author_invitation_56141.asp?c=rss" title="Plainsong">Plainsong</a>--whenever it gets shot down for a community reading program because of a sex scene (which I also can&#8217;t remember), I think <I>wha?</I>
</p>
<p>
Am I the only one who thinks representatives from Utah and Wyoming should arm wrestle this out?

		<p>It is disheartning that one person's "delicate" sensibilities would deprive fellow westerners of one our strong "new" voices. As someone who devours the literature of the literary west, whatever the hell that is, I can say that Spragg is a welcome addition to anyone interested in great storytelling. His work combines the muscularity, beauty, and wisdom associated with the best of our writers such as Stegner, Harrison, Bass, Proulx, Momaday, Welch, Alexie, Everett and Bowden to name a few.<br />
Also, what happened to Allen? Regardless welcome to the book beat Jenny (unless I am missing something in which case disregard this ramble). I look forward to your contributions. The west as a region, homeland, and state of mind is producing some of the best fiction and non-fiction in the world. Hopefully, your work here will reflect that reality and expose us to both the known and unknown storytellers of our land including, perhaps, one Ms. Jenny Shank.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Courtney Lowery, 4-03-07</b>
		<p>Hi Michael, <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and commenting. Allen is still writing for us -- just not full time as the Books and Writers editor anymore. <br />
<br />
So, watch for some of his writing on these pages from time to time, but yes, do meet Jenny, our new Books and Writers editor.</p>

		<p>Thank you for this piece. I lived in SLC for 5 years, going to the University of Utah. I grew up in Houston, TX and tried to become a resident of SLC but I never truly felt comfortable. It is issues like this that make it hard to live in such a city. There is too much of a grasp by one group...people in SLC miss out on some great things in life. And no, I am not a very liberal person.<br />
<br />
Places, like Boise, are the cities that offer a wonderful community and local western culture that even a Texan feels at home in.<br />
<br />
Finally, thank you for writing this piece...I am now going to find a nice synopsis of the book and consider purchasing.</p>

		<p>A good book, a famous book, that might titillate the librarian and bring him or her up with the times would be The Carpetbaggers by Harold Robbins.  It is an old book now but one filled with some of best and the worst realities of the times.  Especially the depiction of a rape in which the woman's breast is removed to be made into a tobacco pouch.  Not recommended reading but definitely reading for anyone interested in a taste of the realities of life instead of fairy tales</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Stuart Blaber, 4-03-07</b>
		<p>Oops, I almost forgot another book full of atrocities that should definitely be banned from all library shelves.  In it there is a description of how God kills a man's wife just because she looked at him, and of how he, god, watched while the man had a sexual relationship with both his daughters with his blessing.  This kind of book should never be seen by anyone, adult or child.  It is of course the bible. (Leviticus)</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tracy Medley, 4-03-07</b>
		<p>Just to make a quick quibble here - the Salt Lake <b>County</b> Library crew (unfortunately) deselected Spragg - not, as stated in the piece,  Salt Lake <b>City</b> librarians. It probably doesn't make a huge difference to those living outside of this area, but for us Salt Lakers - it really does. The city and county run completely separate library systems with different programs, collections, and mindset. <br />
The Salt Lake City library system is one of the most progressive in the west; hosting the largest independent "zine" collection this side of Portland and we all know what kind of language can be found in those (not to mention grammar - hee!).<br />
The County librarians who gave Spragg the bait and switch should be ashamed of themselves - but, let's be clear that not all of Salt Lake is filled with Miss Primms and Patty Prudes. <br />

		<p>Thanks for the clarification...I was just letting out a little rant too. Ha!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-04-07</b>
		<p>Thanks Tracy--leave it to a Coloradoan such as myself to misunderstand the intricacies of Utah government.  I've made the change in the post above.  And hooray for Salt Lake <i>City</i> librarians!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Tracy Medley, 4-04-07</b>
		<p>Thanks Jenny - We've got to take the tiny triumphs when we can around here. Ha!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mary Scriver, 4-04-07</b>
		<p>James Welch's book, "Fools Crow," ran into the same sort of prudish objection a few years ago when it was the All-State book to read at the same time everywhere.  The objection was to two paragraphs in which a boy commits a terrible crime that causes his life to be destroyed.  Actually, in modern terms the crime was at least understandable.  (He is stealing horses, nearly caught, and hides in a tipi that is sheltering girls dying of smallpox.  He slides under their buffalo robes, finds them naked and hot from fevers, and -- being full of adrenaline -- takes advantage.  There are no details.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we are taking the wrong approach in labeling books and movies as to whether they are offensive.  Perhaps we ought to be applying exams and certifications to readers, such as,  "Too immature for advanced books,"  "Too attached to convention to read about others," and then at the high end,  "Capable of reading with intelligence and insight."<br />
<br />
What hurts is that this nastiness was done to Spragg, a quietly generous and conservative man, by librarians who will probably be excoriated by their peers for this.<br />

		<p>As a Wyoming librarian and a big Mark Spragg reader and fan, I have to think the Salt Lake COUNTY librarians have earned the right to be laughing stocks to one and all, far and near.  They have "dis-invited" one of the best speakers I have ever heard on living in the West and the pleasures and challenges of reading.  His remarks on the importance of libraries and librarians went straight to my heart.  It is sad that the Utah librarians have missed their chance to hear this gifted and generous man speak.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Stuart Blaber, 4-05-07</b>
		<p>Intelligence is as gift that is not dealt out equally.  It is not the fault of the Salt Lake librarians if they missed out on this luxury.  We should not laugh at their stupidity.  They can't be held accountable for their inherited shortcomings.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Grumpy Old Guy, 4-05-07</b>
		<p>Well, hell.   As someone who has read the "professional literature" in the field of Library Science for over 50 years I have to say that learning of this / these actions by the SL County Librarians is discouraging.   The biggest censors of all are those who self-censor; those who can not see that they have an obligation beyond their own interests and views to serve the readers who place their trust in them.  Shame, shame on them, such lack of self-awareness and the presence of such self-serving actions is a very sad commentary on the profession which deserves much more honor than they exhibit.</p>

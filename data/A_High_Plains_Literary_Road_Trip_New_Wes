							I&#8217;ll be heading out east from Denver on I-80 tomorrow, going to a family wedding in Omaha, making the same eight-hour drive I&#8217;ve been doing all my life between the city where I grew up and eastern Nebraska, where my extended family lives.  I&#8217;ve never found the prairie and cornfield-lined stretches of I-80 to be boring, as a lot of people seem to&#8212;instead I see the landscape as the perfect canvas for day dreaming, and, if I&#8217;m not driving the car, a great opportunity to read.  <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> recently constructed a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2005/06/05/books/20050605_BOOKMAP_GRAPHIC.html" title="Literary Map of Manhattan">Literary Map of Manhattan</a>, plotting places in the city where fictional characters lived.  I don&#8217;t see why we can&#8217;t do the same with the West&#8212;sure, our map will be a bit more sparsely populated, but that just gives the characters more room to loom larger-than-life.<br />
<br />
Starting in Denver, I&#8217;m a little at a loss for great literary fiction set in my city.  Sure, Annie Proulx used a Denverite protagonist for her 2003 novel <i>That Old Ace In The Hole</i>, but a lot of critics agreed that that wasn&#8217;t her best work, which seems to take place further north, in Wyoming.  There are many genre writers who set their mysteries and romances in Denver, and there are many literary writers who live in Denver but seem to set their fiction elsewhere.  I&#8217;d appreciate it if any one has a great Denver literary fiction book to recommend, but until then, I&#8217;ll have to rely on some nonfiction, Jack Kerouac&#8217;s <i>On The Road</i>, in which he made a westerly journey over I-80 through Denver, visiting many towns that I recognize mainly from having stopped in them for gas on my way home from college. The Denver city website has a great Kerouac <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/today_driving_beat_introduction.asp" title="Denver driving tour">Denver driving tour</a>.<br />
<br />
On my way east out of Colorado, I&#8217;ll pass through the high plains landscape that inspired Kent Haruf&#8217;s fictional town of Holt, Colorado, where he set his novels including <i>Eventide</i> and <i>Plainsong</i>.  As I cross the Colorado border and pass south of the Sand Hills region of Nebraska, I&#8217;ll be thinking of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandozlit.com/mari.html" title="Mari Sandoz">Mari Sandoz</a>, who immortalized this land in historical books such as <i>Old Jules</i> and <i>Buffalo Hunters</i>. The Nebraska Center for Writers includes Sandoz in an online <a target="_blank" href="http://mockingbird.creighton.edu/NCW/tour.htm" title="literary tour of Nebraska">literary tour of Nebraska</a>.<br />
<br />
Willa Cather looms large over the entire literary map of the West&#8212;there&#8217;s <i>Death Comes for the Arch Bishop</i> for Santa Fe, <i>The Professor&#8217;s House</i> for Mesa Verde, Colorado, and in <i>Song of the Lark</i>, young Thea Kronberg becomes an international opera singer after growing up in a sleepy fictional Colorado town called Moonstone. Cather is even more associated with the country I&#8217;ll be visiting in Nebraska&#8212;her masterpieces <i>My Antonia</i> and <i>O Pioneers!</i> are set in locations based on Red Cloud, the eastern Nebraska town where she spent part of her childhood. My mother&#8217;s family are from the same group of Nebraska Bohemian-Czech farmers that Cather writes about in <i>My Antonia</i>, and I even made a pilgrimage to out-of-the-way Red Cloud once, home of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.willacather.org/" title="Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial & Education Foundation">Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial & Education Foundation</a>.<br />
<br />
Swinging back toward contemporary writing, I recently read Poet Laureate Ted Kooser&#8217;s delightful book of essays, <a target="_blank" href="http://unp.unl.edu/bookinfo/4202.html" title="Local Wonders: Seasons in the Bohemian Alps">Local Wonders: Seasons in the Bohemian Alps</a>, which is set in the same neck of the prairie as Cather&#8217;s Nebraska books.  My mother bought copies of <i>Local Wonders</i> for her sister and several of her seven brothers, and we&#8217;ve all been having great fun reading about the landscape that we know so well, as seen by Kooser&#8217;s gifted eye.<br />
<br />
My trip back and forth Nebraska this weekend may be long, but there are plenty of great books to fill it.<br />

		<p>I haven't read it yet, but that book is by Heidi Julavits, who set the book in Pueblo because her grandmother lived in that town for two years during the depression.  There's kind of a funny story about this, too: Julavits, who has never lived in Colorado, changed a few details about Pueblo in the novel, such as turning it into a mining town, and met with protests from Pueblo residents when she did a reading in Colorado.  (Probably because Colorado is so often ignored by New York publishers that on the rare occasion when a major publisher puts out a book of literary fiction set in Colorado, people are eager to see themselves and their home state accurately portrayed.) Julavits wrote an article about this experience and why she thinks fiction writers should have the right to stretch the truth for <i>Poets & Writers</i>in the 2002 January/February issue. It was called "Fiction 21c: History as an Occasion for Literature," but unfortunately it's not online any more.<br />

The site does offer the rebuttal a reader wrote to her article, though:<br />

		<p>Literary maps draw in a wide range of readers and make excellent placemats and conversation starters. Years ago a company brought out poster-sized literary maps of Central and South America, though no one I know seems to still have one. For my recent book, "Writing on the Edge: A Borderlands Reader" (University of Arizona Press), I drew on some of the best writing about the U.S.-Mexico frontier from the last hundred years to show what a vibrant literary turf the borderlands encapsules – on both sides. It includes short stories, essays, corridos, travelogues, poetry, cuentos, a couple of cartoons, crónicas, and even a short play. The authors range from Graham Greene to Flaco Jiménez.  Because the book was by necessity linear, we wanted to spice it up with a map that linked each contributor to a geographic place. Cartographic precision was not our primary concern; nobody was going to drive anywhere or measure distance by this map. Still, we wanted each of the 80-some authors to be represented, those from the U.S. and Mexican as well. For our artist, we chose Diane Sylvain, who draws those slightly goofy maps for High Country News. The result was a reasonably accurate and wildly stylized double-truck map of The Literary Borderland. We’re very proud of it. You can see it on pp. xxii and xxiii of "Writing on the Edge."<br />
<br />
And a very nice P.S.: New Times, Inc., the parent company of alternative weeklies throughout the country, underwrote production of a printing of the map, enlarged on placemat-sized quality bond paper. We used it for promotion – book stores, colleges, etc. – and I bring a fistful to the occasional talk about the border I give here and there.</p>

							While neighboring states, especially New Mexico, have long offered incentives to filmmakers who film movies within their borders, Colorado has lagged behind in the promotion of its film industry, and consequently few film crews set up shop here.  Last year, local film boosters tried to capitalize on the momentum from successful movie endeavors such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverfilm.org/" title="Starz FilmCenter">Starz FilmCenter</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverfilm.org/festival.cfm?IPID=3" title="Denver International Film Festival">Denver International Film Festival</a> by reviving the defunct <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradofilm.org" title="Colorado Film Commission">Colorado Film Commission</a>.  But according to Joanne Kelley of the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4656370,00.html" title="“Lack of funds leads head of state film panel to call it a wrap”">“Lack of funds leads head of state film panel to call it a wrap”</a>), Film Commission director Martin Cuff resigned last week, citing “lack of financial support for the commission as well as personal reasons.”  Meanwhile, in the Colorado state legislature, lawmakers recently passed a bill offering a tax-break incentive to filmmakers.<br />
<br />
Carlyn Mitchell wrote in the Colorado Springs <i>Gazette</i> (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1315873&secid=31" title=""Panel OKs Plan to Lure Hollywood"">"Panel OKs Plan to Lure Hollywood"</a>) that in March the House Finance Committee approved House Bill 1362, “which would pay companies that spend at least 75 percent of production and payroll costs in the state. The rebate, equaling 10 percent of a movie’s budget, would only be offered to films originating in Colorado that cost at least $100,000.”<br />
<br />
Mitchell writes that by comparison, “New Mexico offers a 20 percent tax rebate, interest-free loans up to $15 million and free use of state properties. Oscar-nominated ‘North Country’ was filmed there.”<br />
<br />
While the tax break might help lure filmmakers to Colorado, the Film Commission was recently left high and dry when proposed funding for the organization was cut in half in a pending bill.  The Film Commission had been closed for three years because of budget cuts, and now with director Martin Cuff returning to South Africa, its future looks bleak.<br />
<br />
The Film Commission may just have the bad luck to be associated with the “arts” in a state that has been stripping arts organizations of all funding for many years.  The Colorado Council on the Arts, for example, stopped offering grants to individual artists and writers several years ago due to budget cuts.  Some would argue that the Film Commission should be placed in the “business” category rather than the “arts” category, as big-budget movies bring a substantial economic boost to the local economy.  The <i>Gazette</i> cited the recent filming of <i>Catch and Release</i> in Boulder—most of the filming was completed in Vancouver, Canada because of budget considerations, but Mitchell writes that “the few days that were filmed in Boulder, however, cost over $1 million, giving Colorado a taste of what could be if more filmmakers can be coaxed here.”<br />
<br />
Plus, the local economy could benefit from the spendthrift ways of Hollywood talent.  Mitchell writes that Jennifer Garner, the star of <i>Catch and Release</i>, “reportedly went into a local shoe shop and purchased 22 pairs of Crocs for friends and family.”<br />

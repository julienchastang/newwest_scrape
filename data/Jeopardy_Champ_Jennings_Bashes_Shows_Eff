							Salt Lake City's Ken Jennings became the most successful Jeopardy contestant ever, winning $2.5 million over the course of a 74-game winning streak, but he still thinks the game has room for improvement.  Recently he complained <a target="_blank" href="http://ken-jennings.com/blog/?p=70" title="on his blog ">on his blog </a>that Jeopardy categories tend to appeal to "left-coast" sensibilities:<br />
<br />
"Maybe when Art Fleming was alive, America just couldn’t get enough clues about “Botany” and “Ballet” and “The Renaissance,” but come on. Does every freaking category have to be some effete left-coast crap nobody’s heard of, like “Opera,” or, um, “U.S. History” or whatever? I mean, wake me up when you come up with something that middle America actually cares about."<br />
<br />
That's right, Jennings wants the show to dumb down for the rubes who live inland.  He suggests such categories as "The Arby’s 5-for-$5.95 Value Menu," and "Skanks from Reality TV Who Got Naked in Men’s Magazines."  But to properly correct the show's coastal-centrism, Jeopardy would need to add "Opry," "Varmint Wranglin'," and "Picante Sauces."  Come on, Ken, just because we don't live in San Francisco doesn't mean we ain't edjamacated enough to handle the Renaissance and ballet.

		<b>Comment By chris, 7-27-06</b>
		<p>ken needs to grow up, simply put. his snide comments are surprising at least from what ive seen. he's smart and industrious but has used the system, and why not. but his criticisms of jeapordy are really lame. its a great show and im particularly put out by his criticisms of alex.</p>

							When the newspaper conglomerate Scripps bought Boulder's <i>Colorado Daily</i> two months ago, many speculated about what that would mean for <i>Dirt</i>, <i>The Daily Camera</i>-afiliated alternative daily that Scripps also owned (see <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/3572/" title="Daily Camera's Owner Gobbles Colorado Daily">Daily Camera's Owner Gobbles Colorado Daily</a>).  It didn't take long to find out: A few weeks ago, <i>Dirt</i> announced it would switch its publication schedule to a weekly format beginning December 22.  As reported by Alicia Wallace in <i>The Daily Camera</i> (<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/local_business/article/0,1713,BDC_2461_4257446,00.html" title="Dirt cutting publication to once a week">Dirt cutting publication to once a week</a>), the change will result in some staff reduction.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Denver, <i>The Denver Post</i> seems to be plotting its entrance into the alternative daily fray.  As reported <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001657972" title="by the AP">by the AP</a> last Friday, "The Justice Department said Thursday that The Denver Post can launch a free edition without violating the terms of its antitrust exemption under a joint operating agreement with the Rocky Mountain News."  While Denver has a number of alternative weeklies, it only has one alternative daily, <a href="http://www.thedenverdailynews.com/" title="The Denver Daily News">The Denver Daily News</a>.  <i>The Denver Post</i> has not yet announced when it plans to launch the new paper.

							Colorado is about to lose one of its leading (fictional) citizens. Soul singer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.isaachayes.com/" title="Isaac Hayes">Isaac Hayes</a> has provided the voice of Chef on the popular animated series <i>South Park</i> since 1997, but according to a press release from his publicist at 60 Cycle Media, he isn't happy with the direction the series is taking and is requesting a release from his contract.  Chef, who regularly shares his wisdom with Kyle, Cartman, Stan and the gang, is one of the most integral characters in <i>South Park</i>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comedycentral.com/" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a> show set in the fictional South Park, Colorado. (There is a real South Parkâ€”though it's a county, not a town.  No matter: according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fourteenernet.com/southpark/" title="South Park County's website">South Park County's website</a>, it has profited handsomely from its association with the television show, selling all sorts of trinkets and tourist items in area stores.)<br />
<br />
According to the press release, "Mr. Hayes has decided to part ways with <i>South Park</i> because of recent episodes and press that have embarked upon what he feels are inappropriate ridicule of religious communities."  Hayes issued a statement explaining his position further: "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins.  Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored.  As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices."<br />
<br />
There has been no public response yet from the Colorado-raised creators of <i>South Park</i>, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.<br />

		<b>Comment By Christian Buhl, 3-14-06</b>
		<p>Isaac Hayes' hypocrisy is appalling. As Matt Stone (South Park co-creator) has pointed out, Hayes had no problem when the show was making fun of Christians, Muslims, Jews and Mormons, but as soon as it was his own religion being parodied, he has a sudden attack of conscience.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Mike Caruso, 3-14-06</b>
		<p>It is rather astonishing that after all these years Mr. Hayes finally feels the show has "crossed the line" between parody and intollerance.  The first episode of South Park involved a fight between Jesus and Santa Clause!  Jews, Christians, the handicapped, obese people, and just about every group has been trashed by the show since it went on the air.  Nothing is sacred, which makes it fair, if not always appropriate. I suppose everyone has the right to determine what is too much for them, but to be part of something while it blasts the beliefs or condition of others and then back out only when it hits too close to home is blatant hyposcrisy!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 3-14-06</b>
		<p>It sounds like Matt Stone agrees with you--last night he told the Associated Press, "This is 100 percent having to do with [Hayes'] faith of Scientology...He has no problem--and he's cashed plenty of checks--with our show making fun of Christians."</p>
		
		<b>Comment By dg, 3-16-06</b>
		<p>Mr. Hayes also cashed plenty of checks when the show was making racist episodes: The "rich" people moving in th South park (the cross burning in the front yard, the men all dressed in KKK outfits, and at the end, Mr. Garrison says "at least I got rid of all those n***ers)Cartman on Halloween (first dressed as Hitler, but on Chef's advice, he changed in to a "ghost" costume-that resembled a KKK member). What about the movie? All the African-Americans were "operation dark shield" in the war scene. Isn't he also African-American? Shouldn't he have been more offended by any of those episodes more than the Scientology one? Is he being pressured by someone in the cult he belongs to? I guess I just don't get it.....</p>

		<p>I have a hard time believing anyone would call South Park's satire racist.  THAT'S what I don't get.</p>

		<p>Hail the dark lord XENU!</p>

							There's nothing like 100-degree weather to motivate you to head for the hills, even if you have a new baby and you've not yet tested your wilderness parenting skills.  On Saturday as our house grew unbearably hot, my husband and I quickly made a plan to escape town and head for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coloradowilderness.com/wildpages/indian.html" title="Indian Peaks Wilderness">Indian Peaks Wilderness</a>, about an hour's drive away from Boulder.  We weren't sure how cooperative the baby would be, but we thought if we could at least leave the house for the hottest part of the afternoon and walk a few paces with her in the woods, we'd feel like we'd accomplished something.  To our surprise, the baby comported herself admirably and we were able to complete an easy, almost five-mile round trip from the trailhead to <a target="_blank" href="http://protrails.com/trail.php?trailID=114" title="Lake Isabelle">Lake Isabelle</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>A Hiking Must: The Swedish Device</b> <br />
Our baby likes to be held close and in motion constantly--bounced, walked, jiggled, rocked.  I suspect it's because <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/main/article/6669/" title="I kept jogging until I was eight months pregnant">I kept jogging until I was eight months pregnant</a>.  So hiking is the perfect activity for her, provided we use a piece of equipment that makes it possible to carry her for hours on end.  We used the Baby Björn Active Carrier, or as I like to call it, the Swedish Device, because that sounds more exciting.  While strapped to my husband, the baby napped contentedly in it for almost the entire four-hour duration of the hike.<br />
<br />
<b>Evading Mosquitoes and Sun</b><br />
Every time we've been to the Indian Peaks Wilderness before, mosquitoes have attacked us.  We didn't want the same fate to befall our baby, so we decided to dress her in long-sleeved pajamas with feet.  We worried about putting the harsh chemicals of bug spray on her skin, so before we put the pajamas on, we sprayed them with repellant.  We also brought an enormous hat, one that should fit her in a couple of years, sprayed that and rested it on top of her head.  My husband wore a wide-brimmed hat that cast a decent shadow and mostly kept her out of the sun, but what we really need him to wear for total sun protection would be an oversized novelty sombrero.<br />
<br />
<b>Nursing in the Woods: Not as Freaky as Anticipated</b><br />
The kid was going to need to eat a few times along our hike, and I knew what that meant: Me, topless, in the woods.  After a month of spending eight hours a day topless around our house, however, my resistance to this idea was considerably diminished.  Although the initial fear of breastfeeding in public kept me from leaving the house for weeks, desperation has helped me develop various techniques and cloaking devices to prevent passersby from throwing Mardi Gras beads at me whenever I feed the baby.  The route we took had a lot of hiker traffic, but once we reached Lake Isabelle, we found a secluded rock on which I could feed her.  She was a little stunned by the altitude, I think, so didn't eat as much as usual, but we accomplished a feeding while my husband tried to swat mosquitoes away.  <br />
<br />
<b>Racking up Plenty of Firsts</b><br />
While she napped, we carried our baby over her first patch of snow, passed by her first mountain blooms (Columbines and Indian Paintbrush), and generally introduced her to peaks, lakes, and streams.  Every night we have to put her to bed to the soothing strains of a white noise machine--her preferred sound is the "waterfall" setting.  But this weekend she heard many of the actual noises that she listens to nightly: birdsong, a rushing waterfall, and wind through the trees.  This made me think that people who lived in Colorado long ago must have had very contented babies--strapped close to their parents in a papoose, lulled by the motion of walking and the sounds of nature all around them.  I am reasonably certain that our baby either was stupefied by the altitude or that she enjoyed the experience--she didn't cry at all until we were almost home.  Then she screamed like a maniac, calmed when I fed her, and remained calm and content the rest of the evening and night.  So she's a Colorado girl after all.<br />

		<p>But you know, they don't stay one month old for long.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By PJ, 7-18-06</b>
		<p>Yes, indeed almost all babies are easy if you hold them, breastfeed them via a breast, and are attuned to their needs.<br />
If you notice the babies in public who are crying/upset, they are the ones who are housed permanently in a stroller, car seat, and any thing else to keep their parent from touching them.<br />
Babies are quiet when they are bonded to their parents.  And all in all, it really is easier to just hold them.  Please try to consider breastfeeding in public just as normal as giving a baby a bottle of processed cow's milk or soybean based with vitamins.<br />
Hope there continues to be a change in paradigms with fussy babies in public.<br />
Take care.<br />

		<p>This story brought back awesome memories of taking my 3 week-old son hiking on Memorial Day weekend back in 1990. We were camping with friends and decided to take a hike up to a lake near by; didn't have a backpack or anything with us as we hadn't planned to hike, no actually, we didn't have a backpack because we didn't own one! So I slipped my sweet infant son into a little pouch that I created by tying my sweatshirt tightly around my waist while wearing my husband's tank top over mine. Wyatt was sleeping soundly so he nestled snug against me and I held him in place as we walked along. Of course the hike was disastrous as the creeks we needed to cross were raging and the snow was slushy so that you would step right through it into a shallow stream of ice water running underneath. We never did make it to Snow Lake but I'll never ever forget my son's first "backpacking" trip!</p>

<br />
So your hat was so big it covered the kids whole head? Face and all?  Sounds like a good idea until you spray bug spray on it then put it to her face!!!!  Lets make sure she gets a good whiff of that spray!</p>

		<p>Here goes a augury from my latest in the Huffington Conveyance on the outcome of the presidential elections in Ukraine and the bring off of Viktor Yanukovych.  Albeit it was published after I had already posted my article, I liked this crow's-foot from the Economist:  "...old habits cacoethes pass oversee of the pearl-like gates hard. The wont of buying judges or appointing prosecutors to coerce pursuit interests is jumping and well. The paramount on to behoove gone off the rules again to away a valuable asset could term too much to resist&lt;a &gt;.&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The out of the ordinary irony of the Yanukovych be triumphant over is that there are myriad okay reasons why this outcome is contrite designed on the side of Putin and participate with seeking Medvedev, and noxious to the siloviki while chance opportunities upward of the upper hand of the allegedly yearning reformers within vicinage of the state. As the historian Timothy Garton Ash has prominent in the Defender, "there is no indicate that the oligarchs behind him long-drawn-out benefit of Ukraine to ad infinitum being an beyond country. Their restive to is to elbow-room both sides, Russia and the European Union&lt;a &gt;.&lt;/a&gt;<br />

							<p>When I was a music critic, I used to dread this time of year when there was nothing to fill my required pages but a mention of the latest appearance of <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.mannheimsteamroller.com/" title="Mannheim Steamroller">Mannheim Steamroller</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.michaelmartinmurphey.com/christmasstory.htm" title="Michael Martin Murphy's Cowboy Christmas">Michael Martin Murphy&#8217;s Cowboy Christmas</a>.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why best-of-the-year lists were invented: they&#8217;re long enough to fill a lot of space, they&#8217;re kind of fun, and they&#8217;re endlessly debatable.
</p>
<p>
This week <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/entertainment/books/" title="Rocky Mountain News Books">Rocky Mountain News Books</a> Editor Patti Thorn shared her list of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/nov/24/your-favorite-bibliophile/" title="50 best books of the year">50 best books of the year</a>.&nbsp; About a month ago, Thorn emailed all of her freelance book reviewers (including me) for our top one or two titles of the year.&nbsp; I put in my votes for Junot D&#237;az&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5691601,00.html" title="The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao">The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</a> and Deirdre McNamer&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/deidre_mcnamers_red_rover/C132/L39/" title="Red Rover">Red Rover</a>.&nbsp; But I&#8217;ve read so many great books this year, I had to mention them, and several of my other suggestions made Patti&#8217;s final list: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5518865,00.html" title="The Yiddish Policeman's Union">The Yiddish Policeman&#8217;s Union</a> by Michael Chabon, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/aryn_kyles_ithe_god_of_animals_i/C39/L39/" title="The God of Animals">The God of Animals</a> by Aryn Kyle, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5666118,00.html" title="Circling My Mother">Circling My Mother</a> by Mary Gordon, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/kingsolvers_quest_animal_vegetable_miracle/C132/L39/" title="Animal, Vegetable, Miracle">Animal, Vegetable, Miracle</a> by Barbara Kingsolver, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,2792,DRMN_63_5714955,00.html" title="Bridge of Sighs">Bridge of Sighs</a> by Richard Russo.&nbsp; I would have mentioned Molly Gloss&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/molly_glosss_the_hearts_of_horses/C39/L39/" title="The Hearts of Horses">The Hearts of Horses</a>, but it came out after my deadline.
</p>
<p>
The New York Times just came out with its &#8220;100 Notable Books of the Year&#8221; list.&nbsp; There were only two books on the fiction list that I saw that were set in the Western U.S.--Ehud Havazelet&#8217;s <I>Bearing the Body</I> (California) and Chabon&#8217;s <I>The Yiddish Policeman&#8217;s Union</I> (Alaska), and one nonfiction book set here--David Michaelis&#8217; <i>Schulz And Peanuts: A Biography</i> (Schulz lived in California).&nbsp; That&#8217;s understandable--the New York Times has to cover the entire breadth of books written in English.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
What I didn&#8217;t get, however, was why they left off some books that the Sunday Book Review gave favorable reviews (including McNamer&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/books/review/Birkerts-t.html" title="Red Rover">Red Rover</a>, Marianne Wiggins&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/books/review/Woodward-t.html" title="The Shadow Catcher">The Shadow Catcher</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Overbye.t.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/O/Overbye,%20Dennis" title="Changing Light">Changing Light</a> by Nora Gallagher) and instead picked several books that they ran mixed reviews on, including Jennifer Egan&#8217;s take on Jean Thompson&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/books/review/Egan-t.html" title="latest collection">latest collection</a>, and Annie Dillard&#8217;s <I>The Maytrees</I>, which <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Reed-t.html" title="Julia Reed didn't much like">Julia Reed didn&#8217;t much like</a>.
</p>
<p>
But enough with lists.&nbsp; If you want to get out in the next few weeks but fear you might puke if you hear Michael Martin Murphy warble &#8220;Wildfire&#8221; one more time, head to Denver&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mizelcenter.org" title="Mizel Arts &amp; Culture Center">Mizel Arts &amp; Culture Center</a> for its annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mizelcenter.org/books.html" title="Festival of Jewish Books &amp; Authors">Festival of Jewish Books &amp; Authors</a>, which kicks off Thursday, November 29.&nbsp; The Mizel Center has been bringing topnotch writers to Colorado for 41 years now, and the new lineup is no exception.&nbsp; There are many enticing talks scheduled, but the one that looks the most intriguing to me is the &#8220;Young Literary Lions&#8221; program on December 3, featuring <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nathanenglander.com/" title="Nathan Englander">Nathan Englander</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jennifergilmore.net" title="Jennifer Gilmore">Jennifer Gilmore</a>.&nbsp; I learned from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/books/review/Donadio-t.html" title="this New York Times article">this New York Times article</a> earlier this year that it&#8217;s no wonder the Mizel Center draws such acclaimed authors: the Jewish Culture Center book tour circuit is apparently very competitive.

		<p>Hi, Jenny,<br />
<br />
I enjoy reading your books column and reviews. They're sparkly!<br />
<br />
As an avid reader, especially of books about our region, and as ahem, a writer of same, I'd like to see more about books from the Rocky Mountains. Caught in the gap as we are, literature from our part of the country gets very little ink from periodicals of either coast.<br />
<br />
As a plug, my first novel, Clearing Customs, was named Book of the Year 2005 for fiction by OnLine Review of Books, but got hardly any notice in our regional press. My latest novel, Coyota, was just released October 1, but again, to a thunderous silence, even from regional periodicals. One blurbist called it "the consummate Southwestern novel. Page Stegner said "Egan has written a bi-culturally smart, swiftmoving page turner ..."<br />
<br />
I'm quite sure we sent you a book and press kit. They're surely there somewhere in your sludge pile. But if not, contact <a href="http://www.newwest.net/?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.papalotepress.com">http://www.papalotepress.com</a> and we'll have Santa Claus drop off another book for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks! Keep up the good work! //Martha Egan, Corrales, NM</p>

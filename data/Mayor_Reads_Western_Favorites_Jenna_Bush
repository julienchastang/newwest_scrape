							<p>Elections wrapped up yesterday, but things are still looking political on the regional books front.&nbsp; For starters, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org/" title="Center for the American West's">Center of the American West&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Words To Stir The Soul&#8221; reading is tonight on the CU Boulder campus (7 p.m., Old Main Auditorium, free).&nbsp; The annual event has long featured local notables reading their favorite selections from Western literature, and this year&#8217;s presentation, according the Center&#8217;s website, &#8220;honors the tireless and oftentimes thankless exertions of Colorado&#8217;s public servants&#8221; (Although this press release is unsigned, I can hear the delightful voice of the scholar Patricia Limerick, who directs the center, in that phrase).&nbsp; Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, who has been a &#8220;tireless&#8221; book booster, will host.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of books Mayor Hickenlooper has boosted, this year&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denvergov.org/onebook/Events/tabid/427923/Default.aspx" title="One Book, One Denver">One Book, One Denver</a> is wrapping up with Nick Arvin&#8217;s readings from <I>Articles of War</I> at the LoDo <a target="_blank" href="tatteredcover.com" title="Tattered Cover">Tattered Cover</a> on November 8 (7 p.m.) and at Manual High School on November 14.&nbsp; Look for my interview of Arvin in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books" title="Rocky Mountain News Books section">Rocky Mountain News Books section</a> and on <a target="_blank" href="http://newwest.net/books/" title="NewWest.net/books">NewWest.net/books</a> on Friday.

The Rocky Mountain News <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5739525,00.html" title="ran an item Monday">ran an item Monday</a> on the objects that people are forbidden to bring to Jenna Bush&#8217;s reading at the Tattered Cover in LoDo on November 29 (7 p.m.).&nbsp; The extensive list includes the expected, such as weapons and plastic replicas of weapons, and the unexpected, such as umbrellas, backpacks, &#8220;containers of any type&#8212;bottles, cans, spray containers,&#8221; unopened envelopes and packages, and knitting needles.&nbsp; In case you&#8217;re tempted to just show up naked, that would probably be frowned upon by the security team who will begin screening patrons an hour before the reading.&nbsp; (Free tickets are available now with the purchase of the book, <i>Ana&#8217;s Story: A Journey of Hope</i>.)

		<p>How often do you have to buy a book before you can attend a reading by a young new author?!?! This stinks. Are you going to attend and report on how many Repubs show up to support her Dad???Who gets the money from the sale--anything going to Anna ?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 11-08-07</b>
		<p>Yeah, it's not a very common practice for a first-time author, but the Tattered Cover does this occasionally for events that are expected to be big draws.  I think it's more fair than what the Boulder Book Store, for example, does for big events--they charge a ticket fee, no book included, such as the recent appearance by Paul Krugman, which cost $7.  Still, $7 isn't too bad if the event is entertaining enough.<br />
<br />
As for me, I have no plans to attend at the moment--I don't feel like buying the book with all the stacks and stacks other great things I have to read that haven't gotten as much attention.  I'd love to hear someone's report on it, though.<br />
<br />
And according to the AP, all of Jenna Bush's proceeds from the book will be donated to UNICEF, the organization through which she met the subject of the book.</p>

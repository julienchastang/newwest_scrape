							Buried in the middle of Thursdayâ€™s <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4298877,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a> was the kind of story that could help turn around declining newspaper sales if it were properly exploited: Two <i>Playboy</i> playmates, Danielle Gamba and Carrie Minter, were arrested after behaving with drunken belligerence on a flight from Denver to San Antonio on Sunday. According to the <i>Rocky</i>, the playmates â€œwere allegedly so drunk on the plane that they were deemed a danger to themselves and othersâ€¦According to police reports, the women fought with each other and with passengers.â€?  Arresting them was one option, setting up a Jello wrestling pit would have been another.  <br />
<br />
But wait, it gets better: â€œSan Antonio authorities say the episode became even more bizarre when Gamba made sexual advances toward two police officers in an attempt to avoid arrest.â€?  Come on, <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, in a time of declining newspaper readership, why would you bury such a compelling news story in the â€œBriefingâ€? section on page 38 instead of trumpeting it on the front cover and adding a full-color pictorial?  Have you learned nothing from â€œHard Copyâ€??  I do give them credit, though, for running two of the sultriest mug shots Iâ€™ve ever seen.<br />
<br />
According to the bio on <a href="http://www.daniellegamba.com" title="Ms. Gamba's website">Ms. Gamba's website</a>, sheâ€™s â€œfamily-oriented and love[s] spending time with friends and family whether it be curling up on the couch or traveling the open seas.â€?  One passage in the bio is particularly illuminating: â€œAs for what my future holds, there are so many avenues I want to explore, so I suppose itâ€™s a matter of what happens first.â€?  I guess she just found out â€œwhat happens first.â€?  As for Ms. Minter, the bio on <a href="http://www.carrieminter.com" title="her website">her website</a> contains a similar tale: â€œI work hard at my modeling, and take acting classes in Sherman Oaks at Bobbie Chance's Studio.  As for what my future holds, I have no idea, but I'm a big dreamer, and I've definitely got a few ideas in mind.â€?  Did those ideas include engaging in a drunken catfight at 30,000 feet?

		<p>This is almost too good to be true.  Are you putting us on?  I wonder what they yelled at each other while they were fighting?<br />
<br />
"You bitch!"<br />
<br />
"You...slut!"</p>

		<p>I simply thought I'd share this original Hostgator.com coupon code I recently found on the internet with the network. The following afflicted me with a web hosting account for my site for only $0.01 !  <br />
It continues to be valid so you should try it out. Simply type GETCOUPON613 while in the coupon particular field once you checkout and that is certainly it. I think you'll appreciate it and find this helpful.</p>

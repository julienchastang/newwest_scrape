							<p><i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailemeloy.com/mailemeloy/Home.html" title="Malie Meloy">Malie Meloy</a> grew up in Helena, currently lives in Los Angeles, and has become one of the most acclaimed young American fiction writers in recent years, with two novels (2003&#8217;s </I>Liars and Saints<I> and 2006&#8217;s </I>A Family Daughter<I>) and two short story collections (2002&#8217;s </I>Half in Love<I>  and the new </I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/bad_behavior_maile_meloys_both_ways_is_the_only_way_i_want_it/C39/L39/" title="Both Ways Is The Only Way I Want It">Both Ways Is The Only Way I Want It</a><I>) to her credit.&nbsp; Granta listed her among the 21 &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bestyoungnovelists.com/Granta-97-Best-of-Young-American-Novelists-2-2007" title="Best Young American Novelists">Best Young American Novelists</a>&#8221; in a 2007 feature, and she has won several awards including The Aga Khan Prize for Fiction from The Paris Review, a PEN/Malamud Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Meloy will appear in Missoula at this year&#8217;s Montana Festival of the Book on October 22 (Wilma Theater).&nbsp; I recently interviewed Meloy via email about her new story collection, her writing process, and the difference in word choice between her and her brother, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.decemberists.com/" title="The Decemberists">The Decemberists</a>&#8216; Colin Meloy.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>New West: Eight of the eleven stories in this collection are narrated by or written from the perspective of male characters.&nbsp; Why did you decide to write mainly from the male perspective?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Maile Meloy:</b> The stories were written over several years, so I didn&#8217;t realize how prevalent the male perspective was until I was putting the book together.&nbsp; There was a while when I was first writing stories when I didn&#8217;t feel I could write a man&#8217;s voice, but now it feels almost more comfortable, maybe because it&#8217;s easier to keep myself out of it.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Some of the tension in several of your stories is provided by past or anticipated adultery, a classic subject that has been tackled by many contemporary short story writers, notably Richard Ford and the late John Updike.&nbsp; How did you make the subject fresh for you?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b> When I start writing a story, it always feels like a process of discovery, and I&#8217;m not really thinking about what other people have done.&nbsp; I try to read a lot of different kinds of books so I&#8217;m not in danger of mimicking any one of them, and I try to write stories I would want to read.&nbsp;   
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Many of the stories in this collection contain a surprise or twist, such as in &#8220;Two-Step,&#8221; when the reader learns that the narrator is having an affair with her friend&#8217;s husband, or in &#8220;Lovely Rita,&#8221; which takes several turns after Rita asks the narrator to help her raffle off her sexual services, or the moment in &#8220;Red From Green&#8221; when Sam&#8217;s dad retreats into his tent.&nbsp; How do you come up with these central surprises, and how do you decide when to reveal them within the story?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b> It&#8217;s all trial and error.&nbsp; I see where the story goes as I&#8217;m writing it, and when I get stuck, I think about what could possibly happen next and pick the thing that seems most interesting or promising.&nbsp; Then I let time pass and read it over to see if things are happening at the right time.&nbsp; I think you can really feel it if the timing isn&#8217;t right, especially if time has passed.&nbsp;  
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: My favorite story might be &#8220;Travis, B.&#8221; in which the title character must drive from western to eastern Montana twice a week for a teaching job.&nbsp; Have you heard of people driving that distance for jobs in Montana?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  I&#8217;m so glad you liked it.&nbsp; My stepmother had a job like that, for which she had to drive across the state.&nbsp; I was so struck by it, by the despair and the weariness of facing that drive.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t meet any cowboys, but when I wanted to write about two people who come from different worlds, even though they live in the same state, that drive seemed a way to make the distance physical and tangible. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: How does an idea develop into a story for you?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  I usually start with a situation, but a fairly simple one, and just see what happens, as I find my way through.&nbsp; For example: the first seeds of &#8220;Travis, B.&#8221; came from the half-serious rumor that a certain restaurant in Montana might be owned by someone in witness protection, who&#8217;d been sent to rural Montana and had to start a life there.&nbsp; I&#8217;d never been to the restaurant, but it struck me that it would be very strange and lonely to leave a tightly knit urban world, and everyone you know, and end up in this incredibly isolated, tiny town.&nbsp; (I won&#8217;t name the town, on the off chance that the theory is true.)  Nothing of that remained in the story except the idea of isolation and the difficulty of connection.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until I had the cowboy as the male character that the story started to work.&nbsp;  
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: You&#8217;ve lived in California for over a decade now, but you still set much of your fiction in Montana.&nbsp; Is it easier to write about a place that you&#8217;re no longer living in?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  I think it might be.&nbsp; I go home two or three times a year, and still feel a strong connection, and it&#8217;s the place I know best.&nbsp; In high school at Helena High, my teacher David Cooper had us read Ursula K. LeGuin&#8217;s <I>The Dispossessed</I>, in which a character says, &#8220;The way to see how beautiful the earth is, is to see it as the moon.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: &#8220;Agust&#237;n&#8221; is set in Argentina.&nbsp; What prompted this story?&nbsp; How familiar do you need to be with a place before you can set your fiction there?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  I&#8217;ve always been interested in Argentina as a place, and a long section of my novel <I>A Family Daughter</I> was set there.&nbsp; The country had scary associations for me when I was a kid, because of the political unrest there.&nbsp; Chile, too&#8212;I was terrified of the Junta, without really knowing what it was.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been to Argentina a few times since, and that helps&#8212;to have seen the hanging parrot nests, and been on an estancia.&nbsp; I also read a travel book by Miranda France called <I>Bad Times in Buenos Aires</I>, and while I wouldn&#8217;t say anything made its way into the book, it was still useful. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Your language is clear and precise, and you manage to achieve a lot of striking sentences by putting together simple words in a novel way.&nbsp; (For example, I loved this passage from &#8220;The Children&#8221;: &#8220;&#8216;Hey!&#8217; Gavin said, with undisguised joy at seeing Jennie, and Fielding understood that his son was in love, unrequited.&nbsp; She took the tribute seated, like a queen.")  Have you always written in this concise, straightforward way, or did you ever go through the phase that some aspiring writers go through of writing flowery prose?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  Thank you!&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I had a flowery period.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t start writing fiction until I was 22, but I wrote a lot of letters to friends who lived far away, which I think was good practice as a sustained attempt both to communicate and to entertain someone else.&nbsp; And I wrote one story when I was 15, while staying with my great-aunt on one of the Great Lakes, I&#8217;m not sure which one.&nbsp; I had a sudden compulsion to write a story, and had the whole thing in my head.&nbsp; I wrote it longhand, the only fiction I&#8217;ve ever written longhand.&nbsp; It had a love triangle in it, and it was set in Utah, in the house of a lapsed Mormon, and it had a sort of dramatic ending.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think the prose was flowery, but it might have been more mannered than I would like now.&nbsp; Then I put the story away and didn&#8217;t write another one for years. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: In his lyrics for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.decemberists.com/" title="The Decemberists">The Decemberists</a>, your brother Colin Meloy uses much more elaborate vocabulary than you do in your stories.&nbsp; Did you have a similar difference in vocabulary when you were kids? </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  I don&#8217;t think so, but palanquins don&#8217;t generally come up when you&#8217;re growing up.&nbsp; He read more fantasy novels than I did, which might have had an effect. 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: Have you ever collaborated on a creative project with your brother?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  No.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a nice idea.&nbsp; We send each other what we write.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>NW: For <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oprah.com/article/omagazine/200712_omag_home" title="Oprah Magazine">Oprah Magazine</a>, you wrote about your difficulty coming home to Montana for Christmas because of all the obligations you have to visit your divorced parents and their extended families.&nbsp; Did the story &#8220;O Tannenbaum&#8221; grow out of this experience of Christmas tension?</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>MM:</b>  No, it grew out of the memory of cutting down a tree every Christmas, and taking one that was crowding another tree, so that the one left behind had room to grow.&nbsp; That image, that idea, was all I had.&nbsp; Then the family was in the car and came across hitchhikers who&#8217;d broken a ski, which seemed interesting, and their names were Bonnie and Clyde, which seemed ambiguously scary, and then I made my way forward from there.&nbsp; I told NPR&#8217;s Morning Edition and my uncle Tim that the CB radio had come from the fact that he had one in his van, and we made up &#8220;handles&#8221; for ourselves, but he has no memory of the radio or the handles.&nbsp; This happens sometimes&#8212;like the time I wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/12/22/031222fa_fact2" title="an essay about being chased by a bear">an essay about being chased by a bear</a> and my father said it was really a moose.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m still fairly sure the CB radio memory is true.&nbsp;

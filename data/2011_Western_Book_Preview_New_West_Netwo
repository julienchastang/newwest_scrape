							<p>In this week&#8217;s Roundup I&#8217;ll take a look at some books of special interest to Western readers that will be published this year:
</p>
<p>
<b>January</b>

</p>
<p>
&#8226; Annie Proulx&#8217;s new memoir <I>Bird Cloud</I> is now in stores&#8212;it has been getting a strange mix of glowing and/or disapproving reviews.&nbsp; Among the people who loved it are <a target="_blank" href=" http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-12-26/books/26286934_1_dream-house-bits-and-pieces-log-cabin" title="Tim Gautreaux">Tim Gautreaux</a>, who covered it for the San Francisco Chronicle, and Donna Seaman, who gave it a starred review for Booklist.&nbsp; Not as enamored were <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/books/review/Fuller-t.html" title="Alexandra Fuller">Alexandra Fuller</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/books/05book.html" title="Dwight Garner">Dwight Garner</a>, who both wrote about it for the New York Times&#8212;Garner&#8217;s review is really funny. 
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Billings-based writer <a target="_blank" href="http://craiglancaster.wordpress.com/about-craig-lancaster/" title="Craig Lancaster">Craig Lancaster</a>, whose first book was named a 2009 Montana Honor Book, will publish his second novel this month. <I>The Summer Son</I> is due out January 25 (AmazonEncore, $13.95).&nbsp; According to the book jacket: &#8220;When Mitch Quillen&#8217;s life begins to unravel, he fears there is no escape. His marriage and his career are both failing, and his relationship with his father has been a disaster for decades. Approaching forty, Mitch doesn&#8217;t want to become a middle-aged statistic. When his estranged father, Jim, suddenly calls, Mitch&#8217;s wife urges him to respond. Ready for a change, Mitch heads to Montana and a showdown that will alter the course of his life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8226; For a completely different view of the West, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://lawschoolblogger.com/" title="Rick Lax">Rick Lax</a>&#8216;s <I>Fool Me Once: Hustlers, Hookers, Headliners, and How Not to Get Screwed in Vegas</I> (St. Martin&#8217;s Press, $14.99).&nbsp; Kirkus Reviews wrote, &#8220;Fear and loathing is in short supply, but there are plenty of cons and cheap hustles in this lively memoir of time spent on the seamier edge of Casinoland.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<b>February</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jonathanevison.com/" title="Jonathan Evison">Jonathan Evison</a>&#8216;s <I>West of Here</I> (Algonquin, $24.95), set in Washington state, is due out February 15.&nbsp; Dan Chaon called it &#8220;a novel of stunning sweep&#8221; and Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review: &#8220;A century after the late&#8211;19th-century settlers of Olympic Peninsula to the west of Seattle set out to build a dam, their descendants want to demolish it to bring back fish runs, providing one of the many plots in this satisfyingly meaty work from Evison.&#8221;  Evison will be visiting many bookstores in the region, including the Tattered Cover (Feb. 28), Boulder Book Store (March 1), King&#8217;s English (March 3), and many other places in Washington, California, and Oregon.&nbsp; Plus the book has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westofherethebook.com/" title="really cool website">really cool website</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>March</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Graywolf Press will publish the debut short story collection by Boise&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://alanheathcock.com/" title="Alan Heathcock">Alan Heathcock</a> on March 1.&nbsp; Heathcock teaches writing at Boise State University, has won a National Magazine Award in fiction, and his book is already raking in the accolades.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href=" http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/reviews/fiction.html?page=2" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a> gave it a starred review, writing, &#8220;Heathcock&#8217;s impressive debut collection pursues modern American prairie characters through some serious Old Testament muck. If it&#8217;s not flood or fire ravishing the village of Krafton, then it&#8217;s fratricide, pedocide, or just plain ol&#8217; stranger killing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Wyoming author <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cjbox.net/" title="C.J. Box">C.J. Box</a>&#8216;s new Joe Pickett mystery, <I>Cold Wind</I> (Putnam, $25.95), hits stores March 22.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s the book jacket teaser: &#8220;When Earl Alden is found dead, dangling from a wind turbine, it&#8217;s his wife, Missy, who is arrested.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Joe Pickett, Missy is his mother-in-law, a woman he dislikes heartily, and now he doesn&#8217;t know what to do&#8212;especially when early signs point to her being guilty as sin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8226; I&#8217;m not going to lie to you.&nbsp; The novel I&#8217;m most excited to see coming out this year is my own. <I><a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/ei8WJq" title="The Ringer">The Ringer</a></I>--set in mainly in Denver, with forays to Ft. Collins, Moab, Utah and Las Cruces, New Mexico--is due out March 1 (Permanent Press, $28).&nbsp; I worked on it on and off for eight years.&nbsp; Many of us had our doubts about whether it would ever see the light of day.&nbsp; A few months ago my dad asked me, &#8220;At what point is this thing past the point of no return, where the publisher has already put so much time and money into it that they won&#8217;t decide not to print it?&#8221;  Thanks, Dad.&nbsp; That time is now.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; So far <i>The Ringer</i> has received great reviews from <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/bbFlY9" title="Publishers Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/fiction/jenny-shank/ringer2/" title="Kirkus Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>, who wrote, &#8220;Shank&#8217;s first at-bat as a novelist is a hit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ll be participating in the <a target="_blank" href="https://lighthousewriters.org/page/view/id/64/" title="Lighthouse Writers Buzz "The Story of a Book"">Lighthouse Writers Buzz &#8220;The Story of a Book&#8221;</a> panel with Harrison Fletcher, Eleanor Brown, and Jackie St. John in Denver on February 19 at 910 Arts (910 Santa Fe Blvd., 7 p.m.), reading at the Tattered Cover in Denver in early April, at the Boulder Book Store on April 27, and after that I&#8217;m hoping to make my way up to Missoula.
</p>
<p>
<b>April</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; April brings <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.harpercollinscatalogs.com/harper/543_1724_323930383332.htm" title="Fire Season: Field Notes From A Wilderness Lookout">Fire Season: Field Notes From A Wilderness Lookout</a></I> (Ecco, $24.99) by Philip Connors, who for more than a decade, according to the book jacket, &#8220;has spent half of each year in a 7&#8217; X 7&#8217; fire lookout tower, ten thousand feet up in a remote corner of New Mexico.&#8221;  Excerpts from the book have been published in such swell places as The Paris Review and Harper&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>
<b>May</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Jonathan Evison wrote on the blog <a target="_blank" href="http://threeguysonebook.com/je-previews-five-books-hes-excited-about-in-2011" title="Three Guys One Book">Three Guys One Book</a> that one book he&#8217;s looking forward to this year is <a target="_blank" href="http://patrickdewitt.net/" title="Patrick deWitt">Patrick deWitt</a>&#8216;s <I>The Sisters Brothers</I> (Ecco $24.99), which Library Journal described as &#8220;both homage to the classic Western and knife thrust to its dark underbelly, this novel has a quirky, deadpan exterior and a hard-beating heart; we come to see how men die and how the brotherly bond shifts but holds.&#8221;  DeWitt lives in Oregon.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <I><a target="_blank" href="http://unbridledbooks.com/our_books/book/the_descent_of_man/" title="The Descent of Man">The Descent of Man</a></I> (Unbridled Books, $24.95) the debut novel by Oregon&#8217;s Kevin Dessinger, will be published in May.&nbsp; The book jacket teaser: &#8220;One night Jim, a quiet wine steward, wakes to find two men trying to steal his car. Against the petitions of his wife, he goes outside to get the plate number of the thieves&#8217; truck. Instead, something comes over him and he drives away in their truck until he recovers his wits and realizes what he&#8217;s done.&nbsp; When Jim learns that the two would-be thieves are brothers with a history of violence, he soon finds himself over his head in a mire of sinister events and must risk everything to regain what he can of his life before that night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8226; I have been enjoying <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uidaho.edu/class/english/danielorozco" title="Daniel Orozco">Daniel Orozco</a>&#8216;s stories for years, in places such as <i>Best American Short Stories</i>, Story, McSweeney&#8217;s, and Zoetrope.&nbsp; At last, they will be collected in <i>Orientation And Other Stories</i> (Faber &amp; Faber, $23), due out May 23.&nbsp; Orozco teaches creative writing at the University of Idaho.
</p>
<p>
<b>June</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Graywolf Press will publish <i>In This Light: New &amp; Selected Stories</i> by Melanie Rae Thon in June.&nbsp; Montana native Thon teaches at the University of Utah, and her fiction has won many awards, including two NEA fellowships, and a Whiting Writers&#8217; Award.&nbsp; Her stories have appeared in <i>Best American Short Stories</i>, <i>O. Henry Award</i> and <i>Pushcart Prize</i> volumes.&nbsp; So you know, she&#8217;s no slouch.
</p>
<p>
<b>July</b>
</p>
<p>
&#8226; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shannray.com/" title="Shann Ray">Shann Ray</a>&#8216;s Bakeless Prize winning short story collection, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.shannray.com/Bakeless.html" title="American Masculine: Montana Stories">American Masculine: Montana Stories</a></I> (Graywolf Press, $15), will hit bookstores in July.&nbsp; Robert Boswell wrote, &#8220;The sentences in this book have such grace and muscularity that they seem more performed than written, and the author&#8217;s images and events carry the nearly visceral weight of memory&#8230;<i>American Masculine</i> is a powerful, resonant work of literature, and Shann Ray is a masterful and original writer.&#8221;  Well, I guess he liked it.&nbsp; Plus, the cover is awesome: a pair of buffaloes smashing skulls amidst an explosion of red and blue stars and stripes.
</p>
<p>
Look for my reviews of many of these books in the coming months.&nbsp; You know what annoys me about my own list?&nbsp; Out of the fourteen I mentioned, there are only three books by women on it and I had to throw myself in there to get the number that high.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve noticed a dearth of Western books published by women in recent months.&nbsp; Sistahs, speak up.&nbsp; Let me know if you&#8217;ve written a book with a Western setting that will be published this year.&nbsp;

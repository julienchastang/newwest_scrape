							<p>Two evocative new picture books for readers aged four to eight got me thinking about how I began to learn Western history.&nbsp; When I was a first grader at a school in northwest Denver, a &#8220;Mountain Man&#8221; visited us.&nbsp; He wore a full beard and some sort of buckskin-and-fur getup, talked about pioneering mountain men&#8217;s survivalist ways, let us stroke some pelts, then led us all out onto the blacktop outside and, as I remember it, fired his rifle into the air.&nbsp; (Can this really have happened?)  Still, whether he actually fired his rifle or not, the mountain man symbolized to us city kids the drama and grubby glamour of Western settlement,  a story of hirsute men testing themselves against nature.
</p>
<p>
Thank goodness there were books and teachers to give me a more nuanced picture of this chapter of history, and two new picture books, <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=100817" title="The Buffalo Storm">The Buffalo Storm</a></b> by Katherine Applegate, illustrated by Jan Ormerod (Clarion Books, 32 pages, $16) and <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dkray.com/books/powell/index.html" title="Down the Colorado: John Wesley Powell, the One-Armed Explorer">Down the Colorado: John Wesley Powell, the One-Armed Explorer</a></b> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dkray.com/" title="Deborah Kogan Ray">Deborah Kogan Ray</a> (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 48 pages, $17) will make history as vivid for young readers as that mountain man did for me.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
<b>The Buffalo Storm</b> tells the story of a girl named Hallie who travels in a covered wagon with her family to Oregon from some unnamed, wooded state.&nbsp; Hallie is an adventurous broncobuster ("I&#8217;d coaxed a wild-eyed colt to take a saddle"), afraid only of noisy storms, but the journey west has her worried, and she asks to stay behind with her grandmother.&nbsp; Applegate has written the tale in beautiful, image-rich verse: &#8220;At dawn, the wagon waited, oiled canvas top gleaming,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;like a bread loaf ready for the oven.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
The beginning, detailing Hallie&#8217;s parting with her grandmother, is touching, underlining the sad fact that when most pioneers set out for the frontier, they never saw their eastern families again.&nbsp; Jan Ormerod&#8217;s lovely drawing of the family&#8217;s departure is set in the half-light of dawn, Grandmother bending to touch Hallie&#8217;s forehead with hers as she entrusts her with a &#8220;quilt she&#8217;d stitched while still a girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We joined other wagons,&#8221; Applegate writes, &#8220;like beads slowly stringing,&#8221; and soon they are out under the wide sky of the prairie, contending with a fierce Nebraska thunderstorm, and later dealing with wagon and oxen troubles.&nbsp; When passing through the red rocks of Wyoming, Hallie discovers a trapped buffalo calf, &#8220;red-gold, bawling, leg wedged in a rocky place.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Hallie frees the calf in time to witness a buffalo stampede.&nbsp; &#8220;Across the land the buffalo thundered, huge and surly and crazed with life.&#8221;  Witnessing this natural wonder strengthens Hallie&#8217;s resolve, and makes her look forward to the adventures ahead of her in the unsettled West. &#8220;Hope grows big here, Papa said,&#8221; when the family reaches Oregon, &#8220;big like the trees.&#8221;  <b>The Buffalo Storm</b>  shows how a story that&#8217;s been told a million times--the Oregon Trail journey--can be made fresh again through vivid language and pictures.
</p>
<p>
<b>Down the Colorado</b> ultimately tells the story of a moderately hirsute man testing himself against nature, but it begins in 1841, well before John Wesley Powell grew a beard.&nbsp; Kogan Ray describes how Powell&#8217;s imagination and spirit of scientific inquiry was shaped, largely due to the influence of his teacher, George Crookham, who Wes&#8217;s mother had hired to instruct her son after he was stoned at school because of the unpopular abolitionist views of his father.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Crookham was &#8220;a self-taught naturalist,&#8221; who took Powell out on geologic expeditions and studied the earth&#8217;s history, in contrast to Powell&#8217;s father&#8217;s beliefs.&nbsp; Powell&#8217;s father was a Methodist reverend,  and Kogan Ray writes, &#8220;To his mind, religion answered all questions about the world&#8217;s order.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
The family moves to Wisconsin, which deepens Powell&#8217;s interest in outdoor exploration.&nbsp; Powell grows up, enlists in the army when the Civil War starts, and as Kogan Ray writes, &#8220;On the first day of the Battle of Shiloh, Captain John Wesley Powell raised his hand to signal for his gunners to fire.&nbsp; A mini&#233; ball struck his wrist, shattering his right arm.&#8221;  The scene is illustrated with a drawing of the fiery battle, Powell&#8217;s pale hand lifted just before the injury.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
This aspect of Powell&#8217;s story is perfect for young readers, because despite the gravity of his wound, Powell was not deterred from the adventuring he wanted to do in his life.&nbsp; Two pages after the amputation, there is a drawing of Powell smiling in the Rocky Mountains in 1867, standing with his wife in field of wild purple irises.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the book describes how Powell organized and launched his famous expedition on the Colorado River.&nbsp; Kogan Ray breaks the journey into distinct sections, and often as not the history provides her with cliffhangers.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a somber moment when the struggling expedition group decides to split up when some men aren&#8217;t confident that they will be able to survive a treacherous rapid.&nbsp; Powell decides to stay on the river, while half the group chooses to hike out of the canyon.&nbsp; An excerpt from Powell&#8217;s journal reads:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;All night long I pace up and down a little path, on a few yards of sand beach, along by the river.&nbsp; Is it wise to go on?&#8230;To leave the exploration unfinished, to say that there is a part of the canyon which I cannot explore, having already nearly accomplished it, is more than I am willing to acknowledge, and I determine to go on.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>
<p>
Powell and the remaining men brave the rapid and make it through safely, while the men who climbed out of the canyon perished at the hands of some Shivwits Indians.&nbsp; <b>Down the Colorado</b> covers a broad swath of history at a good clip, while still presenting the story clearly enough for young readers.
</p>
<p>
Both <b>The Buffalo Storm</b> and <b>Down the Colorado</b> are packed with adventure, and will convey Western history to kids even better than a rifle-packing mountain man.

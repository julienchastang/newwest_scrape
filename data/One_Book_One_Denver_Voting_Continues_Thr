		<h1>One Book One Denver Voting Continues Through Tuesday</h1>

		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 6-10-10</p>
			
			
							<p>This could be the last year of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverartsinteractive.org/contests/2010-one-book-one-denver-selection/words/fine-just-way-it-wyoming-stories-3-annie-proulx" title="One Book One Denver">One Book One Denver</a> program, depending on whether Denver&#8217;s mayor John Hickenlooper, who championed it, wins the Colorado gubernatorial election in the fall.&nbsp; It might be up to Hickenlooper&#8217;s successor to decide whether or not to keep the program next year, and in these times, anything art or literature-related is usually the first thing to be cut out of the budget.
</p>
<p>
The program has received criticism for its book choices or selection process in the past, and some years saw scant attendance at program events.&nbsp; But this year it looks to me like whoever picked the books got it exactly right.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Last year was the first time the One Book One Denver <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/choose_your_own_adventure_with_one_book_one_denver/C39/L39/" title="offered a public vote for the selection">offered a public vote for the selection</a>, presenting 27 choices for readers to pick among&#8212;which is a lot to sort through.&nbsp; The winner was Harper Lee&#8217;s <I>To Kill A Mockingbird</I>.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
This year the vote is simpler, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverartsinteractive.org/node/472" title="a choice between three excellent, recently-published books">a choice between three excellent, recently-published books</a>: David Wroblewski&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_david_wroblewski/C39/L39/" title="The Story of Edgar Sawtelle">The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</a></I>, Annie Proulx&#8217;s <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/annie_proulxs_wyoming_is_fine_just_the_way_it_is/C39/L39/" title="Fine Just the Way It Is">Fine Just the Way It Is</a></I>, and Kathryn Stockett&#8217;s <I>The Help</I>.&nbsp; <I>The Help</I> is the only one of the three I haven&#8217;t read, and I&#8217;ve only heard good things about it from everyone I know who has read it.&nbsp; Still, it is set in Mississippi, like last year&#8217;s choice.&nbsp; As one commenter wrote on the One Book One Denver website, &#8220;I hear this is a lovely story, but let&#8217;s try to branch out of Mississippi this year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
For that reason, I endorse David Wroblewski&#8217;s <I>The Story of Edgar Sawtelle</I> and Annie Proulx&#8217;s <I>Fine Just the Way It Is</I> in the One Book One Denver vote.&nbsp; Both books are rewarding reads, Wroblewski is a Colorado author, and Proulx is a regional author.&nbsp; The way the system is set up, it&#8217;s possible to vote for more than one book by assigning each book a star rating.
</p>
<p>
When I voted on Thursday morning, the titles were running neck-and-neck in terms of number of votes received&#8212;the average star rating has not yet been revealed.&nbsp; <I>The Help</I> was in first with 330 votes, <I>Sawtelle</I> in second with 292 votes, and <I>Fine</I> was third with 269 votes.
</p>
<p>
But more important than which of these fine books wins the vote is whether a good number of people participate in the voting.&nbsp; If you care about public art and literature programs, you have to support them.&nbsp; Or else the people who want to eliminate them are right: even when these programs&#8217; expenses are modest or covered by grants, as are One Book One Denver&#8217;s, it isn&#8217;t worth it if nobody gets involved.&nbsp; Come on Denver, we can do better than just 300 people participating in this vote.&nbsp; So <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverartsinteractive.org/text/471/entries" title="click through and vote">click through and vote</a> before Tuesday.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; The <a target="_blank" href="http://crestedbuttewriters.org/conf_faq.php" title="Crested Butte Writers Conference">Crested Butte Writers Conference</a> will be held June 18 through June 20, and the Readers in the Rockies authors&#8217; day will be on June 19 at the Elevation Hotel at the base of Crested Butte Mountain Resort ski area.&nbsp; The Readers in the Rockies day features readings and discussions with five authors: H.W. Brands, James Scott Bell, Janet Lane, Holly Payne, and Jeanne Stein.&nbsp; The conference includes critique sessions, workshops, and meetings with agents and editors.

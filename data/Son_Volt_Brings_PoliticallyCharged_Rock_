								â€œI feel like this place is almost too nice for us,â€? Jay Farrar observed from the Boulder Theater stage last night.  â€œWeâ€™re used to places where the roof is leaking.â€?  Farrar made this remark about four songs into Son Voltâ€™s lengthy, energetic set, and it was one of the few moments when he paused the music all night.<br />
<br />
	Farrar has a reputation for moodiness that perhaps originated among fans disgruntled by the break-up of alt-country pioneers Uncle Tupelo, a band that Farrar and Jeff Tweedy formed in 1990 that lasted about three years, but whose influence is still felt today. Tweedy went on to front Wilco and Farrar formed Son Volt, with whom he released three albums before putting the band on hold in favor of solo recordings.  Last year, Farrar announced that he was getting Son Volt back together.<br />
<br />
	Farrar also has a reputation as being a tough interview, but when I spoke to him in 2001 about his solo album <i>Sebastopol</i>, I found him to be perfectly pleasant and forthcoming.  Still, it didnâ€™t help Farrar build a nice-guy image when the Son Volt reunion he promised instead resulted in Farrar dismissing all the other band members, signing up a new crew of musicians, and releasing a new album, <i>Okehmah and the Melody of Riot</i> under the Son Volt name.<br />
<br />
	But as the businesslike Farrar led the new Son Volt through one politically-charged song after another last night, it became apparent that the friction heâ€™s had with his bandmates over the years wasnâ€™t due to a raging ego.  Itâ€™s just that heâ€™s clearly a serious artist guided by a singular vision with a message heâ€™s determined to bring to the world and a sound through which he wants to deliver it.<br />
<br />
	The band sounded great as they played songs from the extensive Jay Farrar catalogue, including many from the fine <i>Okemah</i>, an album of rich, classic American rock that boasts hooks so catchy a listener might overlook the apocalyptic lyrics of the songs. Son Volt began the night by playing â€œBandages & Scars,â€? a song that laments the environmental degradation of the planet: â€œThinking about the ozone/ Thinking about lead/ Thinking about the future/ And what to do then.â€?  With the chorus, Farrar tips his hat to the musical tradition heâ€™s working in: â€œThe words of Woody Guthrie ringing in my head.â€? <br />
<br />
	Farrar is a protest rocker, a serious man with serious hair, a no-nonsense bowl cut that falls to his eyebrows and accentuates the gravity of his expression as the stage lights fall on the crown of his head.  This is how you cut your hair, Son, when the world is falling apart.  Farrar played songs from several phases of his career, including â€œBarstowâ€? from <i>Sebastopol</i>, another tune with an alarming message: â€œDonâ€™t take notice of the rising waters/ Donâ€™t take notice where rivers run dry/ Theyâ€™ll be digging through the landfills/ To find evidence of our demise.â€?<br />
<br />
	Farrar never fails to call it like he sees it, but his music wouldnâ€™t be half as popular as it is if these depressingâ€”though truthfulâ€”messages didnâ€™t come cloaked in such pleasing melodies.  Farrarâ€™s voice is still one of the most distinctive and lovely in popular music today, and itâ€™s particularly striking when he harmonizes with his bandmates, organ chords ringing out underneath.

							<p>I just finished reading an insightful memoir by one of my favorite writers, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/features/murakami/site.php" title="Haruki Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780307269195.html" title="What I Talk About When I Talk About Running">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a></I>, in which he discusses how long distance running has enhanced his life and ability to write.&nbsp; The book doesn&#8217;t have much to do with our region, but at the end, Murakami (who runs a marathon every year) writes a funny anecdote about the experience he had running in Boulder:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One other memory I hold dear is running high up in Boulder, Colorado, with Yuko Arimori, the Japanese silver medalist in the marathon at the Barcelona Olympics.&nbsp; This was just some light jogging, but still, coming from Japan and running all of a sudden at a height of ten thousand feet was very tough&#8212;my lungs screamed, and I felt dizzy and terribly thirsty.&nbsp; Miss Arimori gave me a cool look and just said, &#8216;Is something the matter, Mr. Murakami?&#8217;  I learned how rigorous the world of professional runners is (though I should add that she&#8217;s a very kind person).&nbsp; By the third day, though, my body had gotten used to the thin atmosphere, and I could enjoy the crisp air of the Rockies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
This prompted me to think that with so many avid runners in the mountain West, there must be some great literary writing about running set here.&nbsp; But as I pondered this, I was only able to come up with one example&#8212;Rick Bass&#8217;s beautiful short story &#8220;Fires,&#8221; from his 1997 collection <I>In The Loyal Mountains</I>.&nbsp; The story is narrated by a man living in Montana&#8217;s Yaak Valley (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/montanas_jeremiah_rick_basss_why_i_came_west/C39/L39/" title="of course">of course</a>).&nbsp; The narrator&#8217;s neighbor hires him to guard his sister Glenda from bears on her long distance runs, following behind her on a bicycle.&nbsp; A lovely, unconsummated love story ensues.
</p>
<p>
So does anyone out there know of any other remarkable stories or books about running in our region?&nbsp; If so, let me know!

A few months ago I mentioned<a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/pregnant_bend_man_to_write_book_high_plains_book_award_finalists_announced/C39/L39/" title=" the finalists for the High Plains Book Awards"> the finalists for the High Plains Book Awards</a>,  which will be awarded on October 17.&nbsp; I learned from the <a target="_blank" href="http://wyomingarts.blogspot.com/2008/07/hagy-nominated-for-high-plains-book.html" title="Wyoming Arts Blog">Wyoming Arts Blog</a> that <a target="_blank" href="http://209.181.10.125/hpba/hpba.htm" title="a new category">a new category</a> has been added since then, to honor women writing about the region.&nbsp; The three finalists are <I>Snow Ashes</I> by Alyson Hagy (of Wyoming), <I>Feast of Longing</I> by Sarah Klassen (of Winnipeg, Manitoba) and <I>Montana, Too</I> by Bonnie Buckley Maldonado (of New Mexico).

		<b>Comment By Michael Shay, 8-07-08</b>
		<p>Jon Billman has a fine story that involves running and sled dog races and hunting in "Calcutta," from his collection "When We Were Wolves." The story is set in Hams Fork, Wyoming, which sounds suspiciously like Kemmerer where Jon lived before heading off to New Mexico and then Iowa. He's originally from Rapid City.</p>

		<p>Thanks, Michael.<br />

Carl Mackey emailed in to suggest the book "Indian Running" by Peter Nabokov.  According to its listing on Allibris.com, "Indian Running is an eyewitness account of the 6-day, Taos, N.M., to Second Mesa, Hopi, Ariz., 1980 Tricentennial Run commemorating the Pueblo Indian Revolt. The book describes many Indian running traditions and includes historical photos and 1980 photos by Karl Kernberger."<br />

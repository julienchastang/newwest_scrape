							News footage of the mind-boggling devastation wrought by hurricane Katrina left many feeling powerless to help its far-away victims, but a number of entertainers have begun to organize benefit concerts in Colorado to raise money for relief efforts. Most notably, the Dave Matthews Band worked with promoter Chuck Morris and City of Denver officials to quickly add a fourth date to its sold-out three-night stand at Red Rocks, and the proceeds from its September 12 show will benefit the Bama Works Hurricane Katrina Relief Fund. The regular priced tickets were already sold out before the promoter announced today that New Orleans stalwarts the Neville Brothers have been added to the bill, a combination that could prompt people to snap up the remaining “premium�? tickets priced at $500-$1000.<br />
<br />
Tonight at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rise-nightclub.com" title="Rise Nightclub">Rise Nightclub</a> in Denver, members of the Denver Nuggets (Greg Buckner, Kenyon Martin, and Nene) and Denver Broncos (George Foster, Mike Anderson, Al Wilson, and more) will appear at the “Party With A Purpose.�?  KS107.5 has been broadcasting from the club and accepting donations for the Greg Buckner Foundation’s hurricane relief effort all day; Kenyon Martin has generously agreed to match all contributions.<br />
<br />
On Friday, September 9, grungy little Denver punk club <a target="_blank" href="http://www.15thsttavern.com" title="Fifteenth Street Tavern">Fifteenth Street Tavern</a> hosts an evening of local rock by Grease Machine, Fucking Orange and Platte River Killers, with the price of admission to be donated to hurricane relief. That same night at Club 156 on CU’s Boulder campus, New Mexico band Soular and Colorado groups Porlolo and Strangers Die Everyday will play a $5 show to benefit local charity Conscious Alliance, which plans to spend the funds on food for evacuees.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, September 11, Denver’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swallowhill.com/" title="Swallow Hill Music Hall">Swallow Hill Music Hall</a> will host a concert to benefit the Red Cross starring local roots musicians Dakota Blonde, Vicki Taylor, Mollie O’Brien, Rich Moore, Chris Daniels, Clay Kirkland’s Blues Band and Dan Treanor & African Wind. Finally, on Thursday September 15, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.larimerlounge.com" title="Larimer Lounge">Larimer Lounge</a>, Denver’s busiest indie rock club, will throw a benefit with local rock acts The Symptoms, Platte River Killers, and The Swindlers. Organizers will not only donate the $5 cover charge to the Red Cross, but they’ll also chip in five percent of the bar sales, so you can toss back several whiskies and feel good about it.<br />
<br />
Those wishing to dwell a bit more deeply on the issues brought up by the hurricane might want to check out <i>A Hurricane of Issues: Global Warming, Oil And Race</i> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldertheater.com/event_detail.php?id=222" title="Boulder Theater">Boulder Theater</a> on September 11. KGNU’s Joel Edelstein will moderate the event that will feature a discussion with Colorado State Representative Tom Plant, who will speak on “issues surrounding the government’s response to natural disasters,�? Malaika McKee-Culpepper, who will address "the role of race in responding to Hurricane Katrina," Green Party congressional candidate Ronald Forthofer, who is slated to talk about “oil imperialism and profiteering,�? and Adam Stenftenagle of Boulder Green Building Guild, who’ll speak about renewable energy and conservation. Donations for hurricane victims will be collected.<br />

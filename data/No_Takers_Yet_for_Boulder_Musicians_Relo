							During the past two weeks, people across the country have focused on contributing to the relief efforts in the devastated Gulf Coast region, and Coloradoans have already made substantial donations: Mondayâ€™s Dave Matthews Band concert at Red Rocks earned over $1.5 million for charities, and yesterday one of Boulderâ€™s largest employers, NCAR (the National Center for Atmospheric Research), announced that after only a week of encouraging roughly 2000 employees to donate money to American Red Cross, theyâ€™d chipped in $50,000, which NCAR matched dollar for dollar.  Charities responsible for relief efforts have put the word out that monetary donations are the most useful sort, but several people, including Boulder musician Scott Messersmith, have come up with more creative ideas for helping hurricane victims.  On Wednesday, Messersmith was interviewed on NPRâ€™s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4845409" title="All Things Considered">All Things Considered</a> about his proposal to encourage and abet the relocation of New Orleans musicians to Boulder until their home city is up and running again.<br />
<br />
Why Boulder? As Messersmith told James Meadow of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4081499,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>, â€œColorado is a really supportive, strong music scene.  Weâ€™ve got a lot of booking agents and managers here, and lots of venues, so thereâ€™s lots of opportunityâ€¦coming here would be a big bonusâ€”theyâ€™d have a place to live, have gigs, get paid and not have to struggle with a lot of competition because New Orleans music would be more of a novelty here.â€?  Although Messersmith has begun working with the Boulder County Housing Authority to pave the way for his idea, as yet there have been no inquiries from hurricane-affected musicians wishing to relocate here.<br />
<br />
Messersmith is particularly invested in New Orleans because he lived there until he moved to Boulder eight years ago.  For many years he has been a percussionist with The Motet, a jazzy jam and world beat outfit that regularly participates in local festivals (such as NedFest) and charitable activities, and has distinguished itself as being particularly concerned about fighting the good fight on all frontsâ€”for most of this year, the band has powered its concerts solely with wind energy, keeping â€œover 34,000 lbs. of carbon dioxide out of the environment,â€? according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.themotet.net" title="the band's website">the band's website</a>. The Motet will play a Hurricane Katrina benefit at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxtheatre.com" title="Fox Theatre">Fox Theatre</a> on Friday, September 16.<br />
<br />
Boulder might seem too culturally disparate to entice New Orleans musicians to move hereâ€”Red Fish Brewhouse is the only restaurant serving New Orleans cuisine, and there are very few black people or institutions that would be able to provide the comforts of home.  For example, Iâ€™ve only ever seen one beauty shop in town specializing in dressing black hair, in a warehouse in north Boulder, and as far as I know, it doesnâ€™t exist any more.  Still, touring New Orleans musicians do swing through Boulder regularly and find a welcoming audience hereâ€”The Rebirth Brass Band plays here several times a year, Dr. John performed the Boulder Theater recently, and tomorrow night (September 17), New Orleans musicians George Porter, Jr., Stanton Moore, and Anders Osborne will play as a part of the Pearl Street Allstars at the Mountain Sun Pub & Breweryâ€™s 12th Anniversary celebration at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bouldertheater.com/event_detail.php?id=176" title="Boulder Theater">Boulder Theater</a>.<br />
<br />
But next week offers at least one chance for local music fans to help a displaced New Orleans musician: Lyons brewpub <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oskarblues.com" title="Oskar Blues">Oskar Blues</a> will hold a benefit on Wednesday, September 21 for Dr. Jake, a bluesman who has played the venue many times and lost his home in the flooding.<br />
<br />
<i>Update: Scott Messersmith reported today that "so far, there about three or four folks who have relocated here and we are connecting them with housing right now.  I also have some musician friends who are staying at my house until their housing comes through.  The housing that I have set up is through the Boulder County housing division." </i><br />

		<p>Thank you so much<br />
<br />
Three of the mainstay gigs that the band I am with were playing, no longer exsist *sighs*<br />
<br />
I have become weary of rebuilding and can never seem to get ahead. Lilly took its toll several years ago, and now Rita.<br />
<br />
Looking for high ground to retreat to</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Evan Christopher, 12-16-05</b>
		<p>I am a New Orleans based musician wondering if there are any relevant follow-ups (Press releases etc.) to your Sept. 19 article inNew West regarding helping musicians relocate to the Boulder area.<br />
<br />
Thank you.  Best wishes for your holidays.<br />

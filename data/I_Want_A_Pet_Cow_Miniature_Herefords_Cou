							I have always found cows to be handsome and agreeable animals, especially when they are gussied up for the Denver Stock Show (which continues through January 22), fluffed and brushed and shined and standing pleasantly in their display stalls.  I've decided that I want a pet cow.  My mother had a pet cow when she was a little girl, a 4-H project named Little Lulu.  Along with her brothers and sisters, she also raised a pet pig, Porky Pedro.  My mom lived on a farm in Nebraska, and the zoning restrictions there were no doubt different from <a href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:oKrcZ1QPJh0J:www.co.boulder.co.us/lu/help_center/handouts/planning/01animal.pdf+boulder+colorado+livestock+restrictions&hl=en&client=safari" title="those for residents of condos within Boulder city limits">those for residents of condos within Boulder city limits</a>, but one breed—Miniature Herefords—should count as dogs, in my opinion.  According to the <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4398446,00.html" title="Rocky Mountain News">Rocky Mountain News</a>, when fully grown, they loom just ten inches higher than the average 30-inch St. Bernard.  Miniature Herefords have become increasingly popular, and last Friday at Denver's <a href="http://www.nationalwestern.com/" title="National Western Stock Show">National Western Stock Show</a> they were featured in a show.  How did these cows become miniaturized?  It all started about 35 years ago with one man and his dream.<br />
<br />
Roy Largent, the mastermind behind the Miniature Hereford breed, tells his story to Carolyn Hanson on <a href="http://www.miniaturehereford.org/history.htm" title="MiniatureHereford.org">MiniatureHereford.org</a>.  It's a tale of frustration, tribulations, and doggedness that ultimately paid off for the rancher. "It all started at the 1970 Denver stock show, in January," Largent begins. "I was 14 years old at the time."  Largent's father was upset when it seemed that the judges for the Hereford category placed the animals in the competition in order according to height. " My daddy was so furious he almost took his hat off and stomped on it.  'This is NOT the cattle business!  They’re not picking the best animal, just going according to height!'"  As a reaction to this bigger-is-better attitude, Largent and his father decided to start a project to see how small they could breed some of their Herefords.<br />
<br />
The younger Largent continued the breeding project throughout the years, despite health problems, the death of his wife, and incurring $150,000 in debt.  Eventually, the little cows began to catch on and by 1994, he was doing well: "I had increased my herd to 150 head and managed to pay off all the notes that I had with any bank and credit card company.  So, thanks to Miniature Herefords, I experienced one of the most wonderful feelings a cowboy could ever have."<br />
<br />
Now there are <a href="http://www.miniaturehereford.org/members.htm" title="breeders across the West">breeders across the West</a> producing the little cows (including at least four in Colorado).  In a recent <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> article (<a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4398446,00.html" title=""Smaller cows a big favorite"">"Smaller cows a big favorite"</a>), breeder Justin Grady of the J Bar W Cattle Co. in Elizabeth, Colorado, expounded on the benefits of raising Mini Herefords.  As Joe Garner of the <i>News</i> wrote, "Because they are smaller and lighter in weight, the miniature Herefords eat less and have somewhat less environment impact on the land they graze…A small herd of miniature Herefords also may be efficient in another sense.  They may qualify a landowner to be assessed and taxed at lower agricultural rates instead of higher residential rates."<br />

		<p>Do people eat them?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 1-24-06</b>
		<p>Yes, in fact, MiniatureHereford.org features this testimonial:<br />
<br />
"People are finding these smaller Herefords ideal because of their gentle nature, ease of handling, and really, what family nowadays can eat up a regular-sized beef in the recommended 6-month freezer life?  But with Miniature Herefords, it’s no problem.  Plus, I don’t know what it is about Miniature Herefords but they just taste better.  Honest.  Ask anyone who raises them and you’ll see.  I wouldn’t have believed it myself unless I’d tried it.  I thought beef was beef, but it’s not.  There’s a family near here who raises traditional-sized Herefords but they always come to Point of Rocks to buy a few steers to fatten for themselves every year.  Why?  They say the Minis taste better than their own beef.  Some folks may find that surprising, but after you’ve tasted a Miniature Hereford, you’ll be a believer."</p>

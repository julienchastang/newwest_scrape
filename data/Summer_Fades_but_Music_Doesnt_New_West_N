							Jackson Browne will play a rare, intimate show at the Fox August 10, but unless you’re a radio industry insider, it’s already too late to score tickets.  Each year, dozens of talented musicians descend on Boulder during the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radioandrecords.com/Conventions/Tripleasummit.asp" title="R&R AAA Summit">R&R AAA Summit</a>, but tickets to most of the best events are sold out long before they become available to the general public.  The AAA, or Adult Album Alternative format is epitomized by the music played on Boulder’s KBCO—gentle, rootsy, with a twist of edginess that makes it perfect for the orthodontist’s office. <br />
<br />
The Fox Theatre is the epicenter of the Summit, and Wednesday’s show, at which Mike Gordon and Leo Kottke will open for headliner Browne, is sold out, as is Thursday’s show, featuring sensitive British crooner David Gray, ex-Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty’s band, and local-boys-turned-Epic-recording-artists <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefray.net/" title="The Fray">The Fray</a>. As of Friday, tickets were still available to the August 12 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxtheatre.com/Index2.aspx" title="Pete Yorn/The Wallflowers">Pete Yorn/The Wallflowers</a> show, and tickets will probably remain available for the Spin Doctors on August 13—it’s been over a decade since <i>Pocket Full of Kryptonite</i> came out and I still can’t get those songs out of my head.  The other good news is that because so many record labels want to showcase their up-and-coming musicians for these radio industry types, the shows spill over into other venues where it will be easier to snag a ticket. For example, late night shows on Thursday include a performance by Brett Dennen and James Blunt at The Player’s Club and a midnight Tristan Prettyman show.  Never heard of them?  If the radio and record label folk have their way, you soon will.<br />
<br />
Several big outdoor concerts remain for the last month of the summer, notably <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/02_events/02_events_detail1.tml?id=3647" title="Tom Petty's">Tom Petty's</a> non-consecutive three-night stand at Red Rocks (tickets remain for August 18; August 30-31 are sold out) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/02_events/02_events_detail1.tml?id=3641" title="The White Stripes'">The White Stripes'</a> gig at the same venue (August 22). Planet Bluegrass’ third festival of the season, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluegrass.com/planet/folks_festival.shtml" title="Folks Festival">Folks Festival</a>, kicks off August 19 in Lyons at Planet Bluegrass Ranch and brings a variety of folky strummers including Steve Earle, Todd Snider, youngster Missy Higgins and oldsters Arlo Guthrie and Loudon Wainwright III. The ever popular <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nedfest.com/" title="NedFest">NedFest</a> takes over Jeff Guercio Memorial Park in Nederland the weekend of August 27, bringing hippies all their favorite groovy jammers, including locals Shanti Groove, The Motet, and Phish tribute band Phix. Moving indoors, the second <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ladyfestoutwest.org/" title="LadyFest Out West">LadyFest Out West</a>, a celebration of feminist music, art, and performance goes down at the Hi-Dive and other venues from August 6-8.  Finally, Beyoncé and those other girls in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pepsicenter.com/Events/NewsDetails.asp?ID=460" title="Destiny's Child">Destiny's Child</a> will turn the Pepsi Center into a bastion of bootyliciousness August 23.<br />

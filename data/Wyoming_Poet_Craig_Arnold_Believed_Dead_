		<h1>Wyoming Poet Craig Arnold Believed Dead</h1>

							<p>Ben Fulton of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12329871" title="Salt Lake Tribune">Salt Lake Tribune</a> reported Friday that the search team looking for poet Craig Arnold on a Japanese volcano where he had been hiking discovered Arnold&#8217;s trail, which &#8220;showed signs that Arnold, 41, suffered a leg injury, then fell from a steep cliff to his death soon afterward&#8230; Arnold was exploring the island for a book he planned to write on the world&#8217;s active volcanoes, and had been missing since April 27.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Arnold earned his Ph.D. in creative writing from the University of Utah in 2001, and began teaching poetry at the University of Wyoming in 2004.&nbsp; According to Fulton, &#8220;Arnold garnered one of his first major literary prizes, the Yale Younger Poets award, for his 1999 poetry collection,  <I>Shells</I>, while living in Salt Lake City.&#8221;

<a target="_blank" href="http://therumpus.net/2009/05/dan-baum-twitters-about-getting-fired-from-the-new-yorker/" title="The Rumpus">The Rumpus</a>, my new favorite literary website, tipped readers off to former New Yorker writer <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/danielsbaum" title="Dan Baum's Twitter">Dan Baum&#8217;s Twitter</a> feed.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know this, but Baum lives in Boulder.&nbsp; (What other writers are lurking out there, down the street from me?&nbsp; I never run into Jon Krakauer at play group.)  In the past few days, Baum has twittered about why he lost his job as a staff reporter at The New Yorker.&nbsp; There is so much interesting stuff in his series of tweets, such as his description of the atmosphere at The New Yorker--he says everyone whispers.&nbsp; And the fact that one of the reasons he lost his job was that he proposed writing an article on Montana&#8217;s governor Brian Schweitzer, which wasn&#8217;t approved, but David Remnick later asked him to write a profile of Schweitzer, and Baum reminded him that he&#8217;d rejected the idea before.&nbsp; It&#8217;s kind of difficult to read this story in Twitter&#8217;s reverse chronological order, but Baum has now posted it as an essay <a target="_blank" href="http://www.danbaum.com/Nine_Lives/dbhome.com.html" title="on his website">on his website</a>.&nbsp; Baum has a new book out, <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.danbaum.com/Nine_Lives/dbhome.com.html" title="Nine Lives: Death and Life in New Orleans">Nine Lives: Death and Life in New Orleans</a></i>.

I am <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/jennyshank" title="on Twitter these days">on Twitter these days</a>, too, writing mostly about books, though I can&#8217;t say my tweets are as interesting as Baum&#8217;s.

Reif Larsen will discuss his debut novel, <I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tsspivet.com/" title="The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet">The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet</a></I> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.factandfictionbooks.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp" title="Fact &amp; Fiction">Fact &amp; Fiction</a> in Missoula on Friday, May 15 at 3:30 and 7 p.m.&nbsp; I first heard of Larsen when one of my writing buddies mentioned that someone in her class in Columbia&#8217;s MFA program had signed a book deal worth nearly a million dollars ($900,000, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2009/05/05/the_story_told_in_the_margins/?page=full" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a>).&nbsp; What&#8217;s so distinctive about this novel?&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t seen it yet, but apparently the book&#8217;s margins are filled with drawings that are central to the story, which is the tale of a young cartographer named T.S. Spivet who sets out on an adventure from his home in Montana.&nbsp; According to the Boston Globe, &#8220;It is a novel with graphics, not a graphic novel.&#8221;

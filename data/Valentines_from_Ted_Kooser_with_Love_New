	It&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day, and I am jealous.&nbsp; Since 1986, the poet Ted Kooser has been sending women original poems printed on postcards that arrived faithfully every February 14th, his mailing list eventually growing to 2,600 souls, and I was not among them.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; My Valentine shoebox, stenciled with my name, decorated with pink hearts, rested empty for want of these poems.&nbsp; In the introduction to <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Valentines-Ted-Kooser/dp/0803217706/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1202935099&amp;sr=8-1" title="Valentines">Valentines</a></i>, Kooser writes that on the first year of this project, he sent a poem to 50 women, and notes that &#8220;my wife, Kathleen, didn&#8217;t seem to mind, and she&#8217;s tolerated this foolishness of mine every year since, as the list grew and grew.&nbsp; She&#8217;s not only a good sport; she also knows that though I&#8217;m a flirt, I&#8217;m pretty much a harmless geezer&#8230;&#8221; Kooser was forced to conclude his Valentine poem project in 2007, when the costs of postage and printing became prohibitive.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s see, that&#8217;s 26 cents a postcard, and 2,600 recipients, which adds up to $676, not including the printing expenses.&nbsp; That&#8217;s a lot of cheddar for a poet.&nbsp; Even for a former U.S. poet laureate.&nbsp; Okay Ted, I guess I forgive you for both offenses: for discontinuing your Valentine mailings, and for leaving me off your list, but only because you have published this book. <I>Valentines</I> presents every Valentine poem Kooser sent since 1986, along with Robert Hanna&#8217;s charming illustrations of the Nebraska countryside and home where Kooser lives.
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve learned many useful things from this collection, such as the surprising fact that Kooser favors safety scissors for cutting out red paper hearts.&nbsp; I remember being frustrated with safety scissors, which were no match for a sturdy piece of construction paper, but in his poem &#8220;A Perfect Heart,&#8221; Kooser schools me:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
I like
<br />
Those safety scissors with the sticky blades
<br />
And the rubber grips that pinch a little skin 
<br />
as you snip along.&nbsp; They make you careful,
<br />
Just as you should be, cutting out a heart
<br />
For someone you love.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Love requires patience, and safety scissors are a part of that.&nbsp; How could I forget?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve also learned, from the poem &#8220;Inventory,&#8221; that an employee taking stock of a drug store&#8217;s candy aisle can be shockingly forward with the bags of gummy bears. 
</p>
<p>
My favorite poem in the book is &#8220;Oh, Mariachi Me,&#8221; which perfectly captures the romantic exuberance of the mariachi.&nbsp; It begins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>All my life I have wanted nothing so much
<br />
as the love of women.&nbsp; For them I have fashioned
<br />
the myth of myself, the singing troubadour
<br />
with the flashing eyes.&nbsp; Always for them
<br />
my black sombrero with its swinging tassels,
<br />
This vest embroidered with hearts, these trousers 
<br />
with silver studs down the seams. </p></blockquote>
<p>
Don&#8217;t all who love wish they could bare their hearts in this way to their beloved, belting it out in a ringing voice, or at the very least blaring it through the clear, bright tones of a trumpet?&nbsp; 
<br />
Kooser is just as good at conveying the settled, companionate love of long-married couples as he is at portraying the swaggering affection of a young man.&nbsp; In &#8220;Splitting An Order,&#8221; Kooser carefully describes &#8220;an old man cutting a sandwich in half&#8221; to share with his wife, who &#8220;meets his eyes and holds out both old hands to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Celery Heart&#8221; finds unexpected pathos in the produce aisle of the Hinky Dinky.&nbsp; The speaker bemoans the fate of a stalk of celery, resting in the refrigerated section: &#8220;Its only consolations are, at regular intervals, the hiss of mist, and at times the warm and reassuring squeeze of a passing hand.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll think twice before the next time I reach toward the celery for a cheap feel.&nbsp; Come to think of it, my comportment with melons and tomatoes at the supermarket has long been less than chivalric. 
</p>
<p>
Some of these poems are unabashedly sweet, such as &#8220;The Bluet,&#8221; which celebrates the little blue flower ("each with four petals, each with a star/ at its heart."), and others tackle more rough-hewn topics, such as &#8220;Chocolate Checkers,&#8221; in which two homeless men enjoy a game of checkers played with chocolate pieces in a public park, oblivious to the disapproving glances around them.
</p>
<p>
People who weren&#8217;t fortunate enough to make it onto Kooser&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s list&#8212;which included such recipients as the novelist Louise Erdrich and the actress Debra Winger&#8212;do not have to sit home alone with an empty Valentine shoebox any longer.&nbsp; Ted Kooser&#8217;s <I>Valentines</I> will fill any shoebox to the brim with romance and wry insight.

		<p>I love Valentine's Day. This year was the first time when I had a boyfriend on this holiday. The thing is that we were together for only 1 month and we didn't really celebrate it because we weren't that in love after all. But we enjoyed together an &lt;a &gt;disc mojo&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

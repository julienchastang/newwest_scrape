							<p>Here it is, the big moment where I bestow the tiaras and sashes for the very best Western books of the year.&nbsp; Last year I narrowed my list down to five, and I was trying to do that this year, but I was having so much trouble with it, I thought, why agonize?&nbsp; Why not just name six?&nbsp; Who&#8217;s to stop me?&nbsp; Okay, now would be a good time for a drum roll if you&#8217;ve got it:

<I><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/books/stories/DN-bk_lonelypolygamist_0509gd.ART.State.Edition1.4c7f844.html" title="The Lonely Polygamist">The Lonely Polygamist</a></I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_brady_udall_part_1/C39/L39/" title="Brady">Brady</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_brady_udall_part_2/C39/L39/" title="Udall">Udall</a> (W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 602 pages, $26.95)
</p>
<p>
It will come as no surprise to anyone who has heard me gushing over Brady Udall&#8217;s hilarious and heartfelt <b><I>The Lonely Polygamist</I></b> that it is my favorite book I read this year.&nbsp; Polygamists, ungovernable children, a dog in a diaper, a couch of contention, a brothel owner named Ted Leo, inconvenient chewing gum and loads of heart&#8212;what&#8217;s not to love?&nbsp; Do yourself a favor and read this book so I can shut up about it already.

<I>The Wilding</I> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_benjamin_percy_part_2/C39/L39/" title="Benjamin">Benjamin</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_benjamin_percy_part_1/C39/L39/" title="Percy">Percy</a> (Graywolf Press, 288 pages, $23)
</p>
<p>
These two books are by young authors from central Oregon.&nbsp; Both have to do with multiple generations of a family confronting each other outdoors.&nbsp; In Benjamin Percy&#8217;s novel <b><I>The Wilding</I></b>, a father, his son, and grandson travel into the woods for a hunting and camping trip one last time before the area is razed for development, and all manner of hell breaks loose.&nbsp; In Sarahlee Lawrence&#8217;s memoir <b><I>River House</I></b>, after years of world travel, Sarahlee is struck by a powerful impulse to return home to Terrebonne, Oregon.&nbsp; Once home, she endeavors to build herself a log cabin, and drags her endearing, surfer/stoner/farmer dad along for the adventure.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
The western book with the most beautiful prose this year is Laura Bell&#8217;s arresting memoir <b><I>Claiming Ground</I></b>.&nbsp; This is Bell&#8217;s first book, and it reads as though she has been saving up observations since she came west in 1977 to work as a sheepherder, ranch hand, forest ranger, and masseuse, and has distilled them into this precise and moving memoir.&nbsp; She writes of love, loss, and Wyoming&#8217;s flora and fauna with uncommon grace.

</p>
<p>
I loved David Bajo&#8217;s novel <b><I>Panopticon</I></b> and Sam Shepherd&#8217;s story collection <b><I>Day Out of Days</I></b> because they were surprising, weird, and delightful.&nbsp; Bajo&#8217;s story of a journalist chasing three mysterious assignments during his last week on the job for a newspaper on the California-Mexico border was fresh, artful and unique.&nbsp; Some strange things happen, including cameras turning up everywhere and footage from private lives ending up in the hands of young men who make movies out of scenes from other people&#8217;s memories.&nbsp; <I>Day Out of Days</I> is a loose account of a road trip, packed with unexpected episodes, such as a talking severed head, meth lab explosions in Butte, and the story of the poor soul who was trapped in a Cracker Barrel Men&#8217;s Room overnight and forced to listen to Shania Twain songs on an endless loop.&nbsp; After the night of torture, Shania herself appears to him.&nbsp; There were times when I didn&#8217;t understand exactly what was going on in these two books, but in taking a few steps away from reality they managed to capture some essential qualities of the West: its violence, beauty, wildness, and ability to surprise.

		<p>Excellent choices.  Read four of the six.  I will have to add the Winding and Panopticon to my list.  Of the ones I've read, Sam Shepard's collection of short stories is my favorite.  <br />
<br />
A little disappointed that Driving the Rim didn't make the cut.  <br />
<br />
Always look forward to you book lists.</p>

		<p>Blue Lines by Tom Reed - read it!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By LanguagesofMastery, 12-08-10</b>
		<p>Strong choices. I'm glad River House made the cut.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By David Frey, 12-08-10</b>
		<p>Sounds like six great winners. If only the West had more beaches to read them on.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By PugetSounder, 12-08-10</b>
		<p>We have beaches but they are mostly cold, cobbly and smelly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the book recommendations!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Larix, 12-09-10</b>
		<p>"The Wolverine Way" By Douglas Chadwick is a great book of 2010 as well.<br />

		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 12-09-10</b>
		<p>Jenny thank you for your work here and especially for your year end lists. My obsession with the literary west is boundless and every year you manage to lead me to books I may have missed. Yet, I rarely can add to your list as I am almost always years, decades, behind. Nevertheless your suggestions fill my shelves and await future encounter. I do however have two books to recommend that just happen to have been published this year. <br />
<br />
The first is from a long time favorite of mine Charles Bowden. His collaboration with Alice Leora Briggs, Dreamland The Way Out of Juarez, is stunning. Bowden is the chronicler of our fevered dreams, our nightmares. His writing is as hard as rock. It is essential. But this work goes a step beyond thanks to the powerful hand of Ms. Briggs. Together their harmony will shatter your heart. <br />
 <br />
Also, I highly recommend Visions of the Big Sky Painting and Photographing the Northern Rocky Mountain West by Dan Flores. It is a strong and varied collection of essays on the art and artists of the region. Flores is a preeminent environmental historian from the University of Montana. His work is reminds me of a well made adobe home. It is practical and subtly beautiful. Add in the images of Dixon, Russell, Jackson etc. and you have a book to both read and dream upon.<br />

		<b>Comment By Judy, 12-10-10</b>
		<p>Laura Bell, author of Claiming Ground, just visited our small library in Thayne, WY and told us of being chosen for this honor. Glad that she mentioned it because now I have a whole new resource for my never-ending reading list! <br />
Laura's book is a book I feel like I'm an evangelist for--I wish everyone could read it. <br />
The Big Horn County librarian (Sonia) in the book, the one who brings Laura books out at her sheep camp, happens to be one of my closest friends, and Laura's description of her rings absolutely TRUE!<br />
Thanks for a great article and a great list! Look forward to more!</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sam J., 2-04-11</b>
		<p>"Deep Creek" by Dana Hand is a historical novel of the West, based on real events (the 1887 massacre of Chinese miners on the Snake River) and it was named a Best Novel of 2010 by the Washington Post. You might consider including it too..</p>

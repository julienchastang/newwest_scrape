							I just returned from a trip to New York to visit my in-laws.  While we were there, we thought we'd soak up the autumn atmosphere with a visit to an apple orchard and pumpkin patch.  My husband and I envisioned a bucolic experience: A serene afternoon of apple picking amid fall foliage on a crisp October day.  Every fall, we enjoy such outings as we select our jack-o'-lantern pumpkins at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/cda/article_print/0,1983,BDC_2423_5038791_ARTICLE-DETAIL-PRINT,00.html" title="Munson Farm">Munson Farm</a> in east Boulder, at the corner of 75th and Valmont. But what we discovered at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bartonorchards.com/" title="Barton Orchards">Barton Orchards</a> in the Hudson Valley was a case of agri-tainment run amok.  <br />
<br />
A trashy fair atmosphere reigned as thousands of people descended on the farm, paying $3 to park in a packed, dusty lot.  An execrable cover band blared its renditions of "Mickey" by Toni Basil and The Eagles' "Take it Easy," the volume so loud it was impossible to escape no matter how deep we ventured into the orchard.  There were inflatable trampolines and other raucous attractions for the kids, a haunted house, and greasy food available for sale, instead of, say, just apples.  The orchard and the pumpkin patch seemed beside the point.  The operation is so elaborate that its website features a list of <a target="_blank" href="http://bartonorchards.com/rules.htm" title=""Rules and Regulations,"">"Rules and Regulations,"</a> including the stipulations "no outside food or drink allowed," and "we will not tolerate the throwing, squashing or any other behavior that renders the produce unfit for consumption."  That's right kids, no squashing.<br />
<br />
The Barton Orchards' experience seems to be the result of the agri-tainment phenomenon taken to its logical extreme.  As family farms have suffered increasing difficulty trying to stay afloat in a marketplace dominated by agribusiness, some have turned to offering their orchards and fields as escapes for city dwellers seeking respite in the country.  When it works well, as at Boulder's Munson Farm, the autumn scenery and mellow atmosphere are so rejuvenating that you don't mind paying a few bucks more for your pumpkin than you would if you bought it at the grocery store.  Munson Farm offers a few extra attractions--a corn maze and tractor rides--but nothing that detracts from the experience with excessive noise or displays of bad taste.<br />
<br />
As I pick out my pumpkin this year, I'll be hoping that Munson Farm and other local farms continue their agri-tainment success, but don't become so successful that they suffer from the Yogi Berra problem that Barton Orchards has: it's so crowded, nobody goes there anymore.<br />

		<p>Oh, how sad.  That "trashy fair atmosphere" makes me shudder.  Too much of American life has descended into that hell.<br />
<br />
It's so sad that farms are having such a terrible struggle. I wish this sort of thing wasn't the answer.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Bryce Carson, 10-16-06</b>
		<p>This is one of the greatest perils of agri-tourism: Agriculture becomes a sideshow and the agrarian culture associated with it is put on display as "something we used to do in this country." <br />
<br />
Europe maintains their farms as "cultural assets."  This policy comes at great cost to taxpayers, but somehow the Europeans avoid the carnival-like atmosphere we tend toward here in America.</p>

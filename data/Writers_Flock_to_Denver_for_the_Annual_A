		<h1>Writers Flock to Denver for the Annual AWP Conference</h1>
		<h2><i></i></h2>
		<div class="text-feature_print">
							<p>By Jenny Shank, 4-07-10</p>
			
			
							<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2010awpconf.php" title="Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs">Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs</a> holds its annual conference at the Colorado Convention Center from April 7 through 10.&nbsp; According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/husted/ci_14441709" title="this Bill Husted column in the Denver Post">this Bill Husted column in the Denver Post</a>, 8,000 writers are expected to attend.&nbsp; There will be three packed days of events, and this year&#8217;s conference has a distinctly western flavor, with featured presenters including Michael Chabon, Rick Bass, Terry Tempest Williams, Sandra Cisneros, George Saunders, Leslie Marmon Silko, David Wroblewski, and many more.
</p>
<p>
I will be participating on two panels.&nbsp; On Friday, bright and early at 9 a.m., I&#8217;ll moderate the <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2010schedFri.php" title="To West or Not to West">To West or Not to West</a></b> panel, starring Colorado fiction writers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/new_developments_for_ghost_road_press_marilyn_krysl_kent_haruf_peter_brown/C39/L39/" title="Marilyn Krysl">Marilyn Krysl</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_steven_wingate/C39/L39/" title="Steven Wingate">Steven Wingate</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/laura_pritchetts_call_to_dive_in_dumpsters_and_ditch_western_womens_stereot/C39/L39/" title="Laura Pritchett">Laura Pritchett</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_robert_garner_mcbrearty/C39/L39/" title="Robert Garner McBrearty">Robert Garner McBrearty</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/an_interview_with_janis_hallowell/C39/L39/" title="Janis Hallowell">Janis Hallowell</a>, all of whom you may have read about over the years here on New West (April 8, 9 a.m., Room 111, Colorado Convention Center, Street Level).&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
We will discuss how writers based in the West who don&#8217;t write &#8220;western&#8221; fiction are nevertheless influenced by the great myths of the West in literature and film, and how writers either work around or overcome the stereotypes of what it means to be a western writer.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday at noon, I will be participating on the panel <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2010schedSat.php" title="Homing In: Migration as Place">Homing In: Migration as Place</a></b> with essayists Pamela Pierce, Jennifer Sinor, Diane Bush, and Melinda Rich.&nbsp; We will discuss what brought us to migrate to the West (or, in my case, what kept us here) and read from some essays and stories.&nbsp; (Room 107, Colorado Convention Center, Street Level, 12 p.m.)  
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of other interesting panels to see, including faculty readings by writers from Colorado State University, the University of Colorado, the University of Montana, and more.&nbsp; On Thursday, I hope to attend &#8220;Writing the West: The Transplanted Writer as Literary Outsider&#8221; with Summer Wood, Pam Houston, Robert Wilder and Uma Krishnaswami (Rooms 102, 104 Colorado Convention Center, Street Level, 9 a.m.) and &#8220;Women Writing the West&#8221; with Alyson Hagy, Vicki Lindner, Marilyn Krysl, Lee Ann Roripaugh, and Allison Hedge Coke (Room 201, Colorado Convention Center, Street Level, 10:30 a.m.).&nbsp; But who knows where I&#8217;ll end up&#8212;the packed schedule is enough to make my head spin.
</p>
<p>
And for those who don&#8217;t have the cash for the entry fee ($205 for nonmembers for a three-day pass; $45 for students; and $105 for a one-day pass to the conference), there will be plenty of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awpwriter.org/conference/2010offsite.php#all" title="off-site events">off-site events</a>, readings at the Tattered Cover, and a book fair that is open to the public on Saturday.&nbsp; If you can&#8217;t make it to the AWP Conference, check out my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/jennyshank" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> feed, which I&#8217;ll try to update as often as possible.
</p>
<p>
&#8226; If the AWP Conference wasn&#8217;t enough literary activity for one week, there&#8217;s also the <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/schedule.html?year=2010" title="Conference On World Affairs">Conference On World Affairs</a></b> in Boulder this week on the CU Campus, which continues through Friday, and the annual <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dplfriends.org/events/evil.html" title="Evil Companions Literary Award">Evil Companions Literary Award</a></b>  will be presented to Bharati Mukherjee at the Oxford Hotel on Thursday, April 8 at 6 p.m.&nbsp; Tickets start at $70, and the proceeds benefit the Denver Public Library.&nbsp; Christian Toto <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_14803314" title="profiled Mukherjee for the Denver Post ">profiled Mukherjee for the Denver Post </a>on Sunday.

		<p>Ahhhh, the AWP sounds like a wonderful conference. Please write about it again next week. I look forward to hearing your observations and experiences.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By David Frey, 4-07-10</b>
		<p>Sounds great, Jenny. You're panel sounds fantastic. And I loved your Dr. Seuss take on beetles, btw.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 4-07-10</b>
		<p>Thanks Julie & Dave.  I'll be tweeting from AWP and posting my report on the convention next week.<br />
<br />
And Dave, I was inspired to write that Seuss piece by your recent "beetle battle" headline, along with reading "Hop on Pop," "Green Eggs & Ham," and "Fox in Sox" too many times.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Kristen, 4-10-10</b>
		<p>Jenny, I was at your panel: To West or Not to West and it was the best one about the western writer. Thank you and it was nice to see you live. You are a wonderful writer and I particularly enjoyed your recent Pine Beetle poem.<br />

<br />
Aw, you are sweet!  Thanks for coming to the talk.<br />
<br />
I had a great time moderating that panel.  We're hoping to continue the discussion we started on the panel...more details on that when we get our act together.<br />
<br />
There was no free wifi at the conference, so I'll be tweeting some of my notes now that I'm home, and will post a summary sometime this week on New West.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Robert McBrearty, 4-11-10</b>

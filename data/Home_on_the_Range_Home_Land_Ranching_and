The editors of <I>Home Land: Ranching and a West That Works</I>, recently published by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.johnsonbooks.com/" title="Johnson Books">Johnson Books</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.landlibrary.org/" title="Rocky Mountain Land Library">Rocky Mountain Land Library</a>, explain the purpose of this collection in the preface: &#8220;The premise of our book is that conservation is compatible with ranching and farming,&#8221; and &#8220;that conservationists and agriculturalists are compatible creatures: they actually belong together.&#8221;  That is, even though some questions of conservation, such as the reintroduction of wolves, tend to pit ranchers and environmentalists against each other, larger questions such as respect for animals and a love for undeveloped land unite them.
</p>
<p>
Many Americans have a farm or ranch somewhere in their recent family history; mine is my maternal grandparents&#8217; farm in eastern Nebraska, where they raised cattle, pigs, corn, alfalfa, and other crops, struggling mightily to survive, my grandmother working a nightshift job at a factory in town, until they were forced to sell their land during the farm crisis of the 1980&#8217;s.&nbsp; (My grandmother always says that their most successful crop was their nine children.)  I couldn&#8217;t help but think of my grandfather when I read Aaron Abeyta&#8217;s moving poem, &#8220;I remember my father in the future,&#8221; about his father, who was a rancher in southern Colorado:
</p>
<blockquote><p>my father rises in my mind 
<br />
the way he always rises
<br />
in the darkness before dawn 
<br />
noisily but with purpose
<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I think of my grandfather especially in Abeyta&#8217;s lines about his father&#8217;s financial struggle:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
i will remember
<br />
in the future
<br />
how even his own family told my father
<br />
that if he chose to
<br />
he could be debt free
<br />
And not have to work so hard</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is because farmers and ranchers tend to live so close to the bone that they sometimes clash with the aims of environmentalists; they might rely on pesticides for adequate crop yields, or perhaps they can&#8217;t afford the livestock loss that wolf reintroduction would bring.&nbsp; Or, as in Laura Pritchett&#8217;s family&#8217;s case, the land becomes too much work to maintain, and the family is tempted to retire and sell out to developers for millions of dollars. 
</p>
<p>
 Pritchett, who was one of nine siblings growing up on a ranch in northern Colorado, writes about this thorny dilemma in her essay &#8220;Hoof Making Contact.&#8221;  &#8221;<I>It&#8217;s killing us,</I> my mother e-mails her nine children.&nbsp; <I>Something has got to be done with this place.&nbsp; None of you kids love us much, or you&#8217;d notice that, and I repeat, this place is killing your father and me</I>.&#8221;  Pritchett wants to somehow preserve the family land, but she is only one voice among many, and many of her siblings have urgent needs (such as an autistic child) that make a cash buyout attractive.
</p>
<p>
Julene Blair writes of a similar dilemma over her family&#8217;s Kansas farm; she realizes that the Ogallala Aquifer, which they have relied upon to irrigate their crops, will one day be completely drained, but she can&#8217;t blame her family for doing what they have to do to eke out a living.&nbsp; She writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For my people the highest value has always been production and yields, the unbridled use of whatever could advance these, the removal or suppression of whatever got in their way.&nbsp; Yet my grief over the loss and destruction is not, as my plains friends assume, born of my life among urbanites.&nbsp; The environmentalists I met in college or in Colorado, where I now live, did not brainwash me.&nbsp; My conviction in these matters comes from my past on that farm.&nbsp; Had I not sat atop our windmill and gazed over what still remained then of the native buffalo grass, I would have no direct sense of what has been lost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Teresa Jordan, who grew up on a southeastern Wyoming ranch, strikes a similar note in her poem, &#8220;Looking Back&#8221;:
</p>
<blockquote><p>I loved
<br />
that secret place
<br />
down by the riverbed
<br />
hidden by a bank.&nbsp; I whittled
<br />
dolls from willows there, made whistles 
<br />
out of broad bladed grass, told my big bay
<br />
Buddy how I&#8217;d never leave.
<br />
I lied
<br />
though not from will.</p></blockquote>
<p>
This poem brought back for me the summer days I spent on my grandparents&#8217; farm.&nbsp; My cousins, older brother and I (all city slickers), would leave the house in the morning and come back inside only briefly for feedings until it was dark.&nbsp; We played with anything could find, jumping on top of hay bales, building forts in stands of trees, skipping rocks over ponds, running through fields where hundreds of grasshoppers would fly up in our faces.&nbsp; Jordan&#8217;s poem also suggests the practical matters that have pulled people from their roots in rural areas; economics often force the children of farmers to leave in order to make their way, as all of my aunts and uncles did.
</p>
<p>
	Many of the essays and poems in this collection address this tug-of-war between one&#8217;s connection to the land and one&#8217;s need to survive.&nbsp; But a few, such as Rick Bass&#8217; essay, &#8220;The Farm,&#8221; simply celebrate the joy that farms can offer.&nbsp; In this essay, Bass writes of taking his wife and young daughters to his father&#8217;s farm in Texas one April.&nbsp; &#8220;The girls had never seen fireflies before,&#8221; he writes.&nbsp; &#8220;I am not sure they had ever known such creatures existed.&nbsp; For the next hour, we chased them through the meadow, trying to catch just one&#8230;As beautiful as the on-again, off-again drifting missives of the fireflies was the seamlessness with which Mary Katherine accepted unquestioningly the marvel of such an existence, such a phenomenon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	This point comes up again and again in <I>Home Land</I>, that there are marvels you can only appreciate if you spend time on open land the way ranchers and farmers do.&nbsp; &#8220;Living heart to heart with the land--any land, anywhere,&#8221; writes Page Lambert, &#8220;creates a profound kinship.&#8221; Lambert writes that she &#8220;married a cowboy the fifth generation of his family to be reared on a ranch in Douglas County&#8221; in Colorado:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;By 1976, Douglas County was becoming our country&#8217;s fastest-growing county, on its way to having our country&#8217;s highest median household income.&nbsp; Ranchland was being developed at such a rapid rate that land taxes skyrocketed and houses took over thousands of acres of grazing land&#8230;The subdivision&#8217;s current covenants, I understand, don&#8217;t permit basketball hoops in the driveways or birdhouses in the backyards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
No basketball hoops?&nbsp; I thought basketball was one of the few things urban and rural people could agree on as a staff of life.
</p>
<p>
<I>Home Land</I> makes the point that no one loves the land better than farmers and ranchers, because their lives are so intertwined with it.&nbsp; In the beginning of her essay, Pritchett quotes Linda Hasselstrom, who wrote, &#8220;I have come to believe that both my physical life and my spirit are so deeply connected to that particular plot of land, the family ranch, that I might be stalk of grass myself, rooted in arid and meager soil.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
The editors of <I>Home Land</I> are calling for a productive truce between ranchers and environmentalists.&nbsp; As Jordan writes in the introduction, &#8220;Environmetalists have been at least as rigid as ranchers in the thirty-year war that has locked vast regions of the West in litigation and rancor while millions of acres of open land have fallen to development.&#8221;  If environmentalists and ranchers instead united, <I>Home Land</I> suggests, perhaps some of this development could be halted.
</p>
<p>
Except for the past twenty or so years, my family has farmed during the entire time we&#8217;ve been America, since the late 1800s.&nbsp; As far as we can tell, we farmed in Bohemia for generations before that.&nbsp; Having spent so little time on this earth without farmland of our own, it&#8217;s no wonder that I find myself cutting through black plastic, digging into the clayey soil under the small patch of rocks behind my Boulder condo, and planting irises that my grandmother sends, flowers she began cultivating on our lost Nebraska farm.&nbsp; Many people, I imagine, feel the pull of open land in a similar way, and <I>Home Land</I> makes an eloquent case for preserving what is left of it.

		<p>Thanks Jenny..Ya know Colonel Bain really loves those words<br />
 O give me a Home where the Buffalo Roam and the deer an de writers still play..:)</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Robert Hoskins, 7-17-07</b>
		<p>It would have been helpful in this book had these ideologically- blinded editors included some work on the real question before us--is any place in the West suited for agriculture at all?  If you get past the misguided fascination with the myths of Jefferson's yeoman farmers--the modern equivalent is that farmers and ranchers are truly conservationists, a claim that the most honest examination of the facts would prove to be false--one has to answer, no, the West is not suited for agriculture in any form or fashion.  It is too high, too dry, too fragile.  The ecology is all wrong.  All the things that John Wesley Powell noted over a  century ago.  All things that are even more evident now than they were when Powell rafted down the Colorado.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean that the West is suited to the follow-on amenities economy, which is as much an ecological disaster as farming, ranching, logging, or mining.  But we also have to recognize that the amenities economy is a natural follow on to the old resource extraction economy.  The rule is:take it while you can, make all the money you can, then leave when it's all gone (if you can afford to leave).    <br />
<br />
In short, the editors and the contributors to this volume are simply deluding themselves and the readers who want to believe them.  No matter how much they want to believe that protecting ranching and farming in the West will save the West, the facts before us lead to a different conclusion.<br />
<br />
By the way, I grew up in agriculture in the American South--tobacco farming in North Carolina.  I didn't know too many yeoman farmers of the Jeffersonian stripe.  Quite frankly, I doubt Jefferson knew very many of them himself.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-17-07</b>
		<p>Thanks for your comments, Robert.  I think there are actually quite a few pieces in this collection that delve into whether West is suited to traditional agriculture.  Courtney White's piece, "The New Ranch," discusses non-traditional methods ranchers are using in the West to keep their ranches afloat.  Julene Bair's essay, "She Poured Out Her Own," struggles with the fact that the Ogallala Aquifer will one day be drained, rendering agriculture untenable.  Several other authors discuss the West's persistent droughts.<br />
<br />
I'd like to gently suggest that it's only fair that you read the book before you call the editors "ideologically- blinded."  They didn't come across to me that way at all.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Robert Hoskins, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>Dear Jenny<br />
<br />
If you want to send me a copy of the book, I'll be happy to send you my address.  But I won't spend money on the same deluded nonsense I've spent money on in the past.  Your review is good enough to tell me that this book is no different from the previous pollyanna stuff I've bought and read.  I do know quite a bit about agriculture, both having grown up in it and having seen the devastation of agriculture in Africa, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia during my military service, and the devastation of agriculture in the American West since moving here.  There are few places on this planet that are actually suited for agriculture.  This is discussed in Edward Hyam's fine book, Soil and Civilization, published over a half century ago.  <br />
<br />
I've been following Dick Knight and Courtney White for some time, and quite frankly, the term "ideologically-blinded" when applied to them is quite accurate, whether you like it or not.  I'll read their stuff on the web but I'm not going to pay for it anymore.<br />
<br />
Why, for example, is George Wuerthner not included in this collection?  George is the foremost expert in this country on the impact of grazing on western ecosystems, but because he tells the unvarnished truth about cattle, he can barely get published.  Delusion sells; the truth rarely does.  <br />
<br />
The pollyanna stuff that there is hope for agriculture in the West if we can just get things right, or that ranchers and farmers really are conservationists, gets published all the time.   <br />
<br />
It's not true and there is no getting it right.  My larger point is that the West is not suited for agriculture period, not just traditional agriculture.  How are modern "theories" or "methods" that Courtney White et al. espouse any different from "the rain follows the plow"?  It's all out of the same self-delusion.  <br />
<br />
A hundred years ago, people in southeast Wyoming believed there would be fruit orchards in the Laramie Plains by the middle of the the 20th century.  <br />
<br />
The Dakotas and Nebraska were no more suited for agriculture before the decline of the Oglalla Aquifer than they are now.  Agriculture has succeeded in the Great Plains and the West solely by the irrational and prolifigate drawdown of natural capital, with nothing replaced, and now after barely a century has passed, the account is nearly empty.  No amount of hope and technology will change that.<br />
<br />
Nor will any amount of pollyanna essay collections.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
Robert Hoskins</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>Okay, fair enough.  Thanks for sharing your spirited opinion!<br />
<br />
I am reading a book now that I think you'll find more in line with your views--Barbara Kingsolver's "Animal, Vegetable, Miracle."  In the beginning of the book, she decides that Tucson, where she has lived for decades, isn't suited to human habitation or agriculture, and packs up and moves to Virginia so she can grow her own food.  It's been getting good reviews elsewhere, and I'll throw in my two cents on this book sometime soon.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Joan Melcher, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>Very nice piece, Jenny. Definitely makes me want to get the book. <br />
Reading the comments, I wonder what Robert's plan is to supply the country with food. Many of the prime agricultural areas in the East are now topped with concrete. There is plenty of good agricultural land in the West. If it wasn't viable it wouldn't be happening as the margin is so slim. Yes, many farms and ranches are being sold, but that is as much to do with rising land values as anything else. The sodbusters came and went and left a horrible legacy, but many farmers and ranchers since have put their sweat and blood into the land, raised families, improved the land, made a living from it.<br />
<br />
Tending the land in many ways is its own reward. I find much satisfaction and solace in my own backyard with its perennials and weeds. So the thought of people losing a farm or ranch to me is a crushing thing, a loss of self as well as livelihood. I also had the experience of summers in an agricultural setting - in my case a ranch in eastern Montana that sheltered 11 wild siblings. With my sister and I added to the pot, it really sizzled. We, too, were busy from dawn til dusk. Bareback horse rides to a homestead cabin, harvesting corn and vegetables for the dinner (lunch) meal - 100 or so, as we fed more than 20 people and since they were haying, the men could easily eat four ears each, rodeo events in the evening, playing tricks on the younger kids, getting tricks played on us by the older kids, helping with the milking, trying to teach the adopted fawn to follow us. Those are some of my favorite memories. Town life paled in comparison. <br />
<br />
There's a lot more to agriculture than theory. Most of us have read John Wesley Powell and we see his points as interesting observations that had some truth, some being the figurative word. It's always easy to theorize. Acting and creating are different things and most farmers and ranchers didn't read Powell, so they didn't know it couldn't (or shouldn't) be done. Instead, they created their own lives. Most of the farmers and ranchers I knew cared deeply about the land. I'm glad to see this being addressed. It is a profound issue, far from the pollyanna description that Robert seems so prone to thrown around.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Robert Hoskins, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>Jenny<br />
<br />
Kingsolver's book is on my to my read list.  Not because it might agree with my views, but because it seems to amplify many of the same themes of Michael Pollen's The Omnivore's Dilemma.<br />
<br />
I've lived in Arizona, and it is true, it isn't suited for agriculture.<br />
<br />
To Joan Melcher<br />
<br />
Theory has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about the purely practical devastation that agriculture has wreaked upon the planet in too many places, including much of North America and certainly around the world.  I've seen these places with my own eyes, and having grown up in farming myself, I wondered how it could have happened, until I realized that the problem is agriculture itself.<br />
<br />
I would certainly like to know what you think is good agricultural land in the West.  "Good" ag land has been artificially manufactured by the application of massive, expensive irrigation, not to mention massive, unsustainable inputs of energy.  <br />
<br />
If it's not sustainable, it isn't good ag land.  Jethro Tull--the 17th century English writer on farming, not the rock group--would certainly agree.  So would Aldo Leopold.<br />
<br />
People worry about how to feed the burgeoning billions.  Ecologically, the disruption of wild ecosystems worldwide by agriculture to feed the teeming millions and now billions, with the vain hope that humans can fully escape the ecological controls that other species must deal with, can only mean their eventual mass starvation.  All agriculture has done is to increase the numbers of human beings that will eventually starve to death in time.  That's the undeniable history of civilization, which is based upon agriculture.  <br />
<br />
Sooner or later, people trying to escape nature always encounter nature.  That's a historical fact, not theory.  The trouble is, when catastrophe occurs in civilized societies, the outcome is always much, much worse than it was when we were just a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Sinjin, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>The bummer is, that until civilization deals with the burgeoning billions, that nothing will ever get solved.  If the resource is overtaxed, there is no way around the realities that will follow - whether that resource is considered to be oil or water or food.  The undeniable fact is that there is a carrying capacity on the planet, and feeling sorry and compasionate about it is all well and good...but when the resources run out, there is nothing left to talk about.  That's the 800lb gorilla in any modern environmental debate.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Robert Hoskins, 7-18-07</b>
		<p>For a great, if depressing, speculation about what it'll be like when it's over, I highly recommend Cormac McCarthy's novel, The Road.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By mw, 7-19-07</b>
		<p>I can't improve on Hoskins & Sinjin's comments. The 800 lb gorilla is "Amicanus Homo Consumptus".</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Joan Melcher, 7-19-07</b>
		<p>I would agree that exponential human population growth is the key environmental problem today. That said, are you ready, Robert, to go back to hunting and gathering? Where do you get your food?<br />
<br />
Your sweep is so broad it misses some fairly obvious things, like the suitability of the land to wheat farming in places in Montana, North Dakota, etc. It's a no brainer that most of Arizona is not suited to agriculture as well as plenty of other places in the West. Sure, there are better ways of doing agriculture than have been done in the past and vast need for improvement, but we do need to eat and someone needs to feed us until we all become self-sufficient - and if you live in Arizona you probably won't be canning a lot of fruits and vegetables. When you talk about sustainability, I have to wonder, if people have been growing wheat in Montana for several generations, would that be sustainable - or not? Energy is used in every endeavor, so let's leave that out. Has the soil been eroded? Probably not too much, or they wouldn't have still a crop. Are they using pesticides and other products likely to cause environmental problems? Maybe, maybe not. There is a growing number of farmers going organic or limiting their use of pesticides. That is the trend and there's a growing market to support them. I guess what I'm saying is I understand your point, but your tendency to blame agriculture for all the woes of the world is a little sophomoric.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Marion, 7-19-07</b>
		<p>There are hundreds of thousands of head of cattle and sheep in the west that kind of disprove Robert's theory.  There are thousands of acres of sugar beets that keep us from having to pay for so much imported cane sugar.  The amount of wheat and corn grown in the west is also pretty impressive.<br />
It may be possible to keep the west for recreation and buy our food from China, but for one I'm not impressed with their quality control, and I'll take Wyoming beef any day.<br />
Actually I think Arizona is great for raising stuff,  water is a problem, but less swimming pools and fountains would help that.  Covering the canal would help too.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Marion, 7-19-07</b>
		<p>Actually I loved some of those poems and will check online to see if I can get the book.....and I'm not too cheap to pay for it.<br />
Thank you for the article.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Cal Denton, 7-22-07</b>
		<p>There are 6-8 regions in the west that are very productive for cultivation, most  with irrigation. The west has been overgrazed at a big cost but advocates for zero grazing or sharply reduced grazing or far higher public land fees haven't gotten very far with the strong approach. I know the strong approach has eventually prevailed on many environmental issues so I don't dismiss it but this issue has resisted it almost completely for a pretty good while so some stock taking about its history and future chances are in order. The new methods/accomodation camp makes an appealing case on paper but hasn't completely convinced me but I am just an occasional reader not a scientist or a rancher as my family moved off farm 2 generations back. Both groups will continue to pursue their path. I hope one of them succeeds or maybe some of both.</p>

							<p>At the Boulder Book Store Monday Night, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmns.org/main/en/General/Science/ScientificExperts/Biographies/Johnson+Kirk.htm" title="Dr. Kirk Johnson">Dr. Kirk Johnson</a> presented his lively new book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fulcrum-books.com/productdetails.cfm?PC=5917" title="Cruisin' The Fossil Freeway">Cruisin&#8217; The Fossil Freeway</a> to an audience of people he would likely diagnose as suffering from &#8220;PNS&#8212;Paleo Nerd Syndrome.&#8221; Johnson, vice president and chief curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, spent nine years traveling the American West with artist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trollart.com/trollart_toplinks/aboutray.html" title="Ray Troll">Ray Troll</a>, whom he described as &#8220;the R. Crumb of the Cretaceous,&#8221; to produce the fanciful yet factual book that details the pair&#8217;s finds.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Troll deviates from the strict truth in his illustrations, such as in a drawing that depicts a modern Denver street with its fast food joints and telephone poles overrun with dinosaurs that once lived in the area.&nbsp; Johnson said Troll is &#8220;not a scientific realist, but a scientific surrealist.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Troll draws the creatures accurately, but places them in unusual contexts.&nbsp; In doing so, he reveals the strange worlds that lurk in the minds of paleontologists as they stare out at the landscape.&nbsp; Johnson showed a slide of a rock wall with an imbedded layer of coal, and explained, &#8220;I see the prehistoric landscape, not the rock,&#8221; so in his mind, the coal bed becomes the swampy ancient landscape that produced it.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Troll lives and works in Ketchikan, Alaska, and became known primarily for his illustrations of fish.&nbsp; &#8220;In &#8216;93 I learned that he was also interested in fossils,&#8221; Johnson said, and eventually they worked on exhibit that appeared in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in 1999.&nbsp; &#8220;He asked for an old Volvo,&#8221; which he painted and &#8220;turned it into an &#8216;Evolvo&#8217; with Charles Darwin driving it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The pair began to work on the book by taking long fossil-hunting trips in an old blue Ford F-250, and in the book we &#8220;cherry picked the best stories of the American West&#8221; to write and illustrate. For example, Johnson told the story of a &#8220;couple of guys who were driving on Highway 86 from Castle Rock to Limon.&#8221;  &#8220;They stopped to take a leak along the side of the road,&#8221; Johnson said, and discovered a fossil skull.&nbsp; They called up the museum, saying, &#8220;we found this dog skull,&#8221; and their discovery turned out to be only the sixth known fossilized specimen of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taeniodonta" title="Taeniodont">Taeniodont</a>, a weird-looking mammal that lived from the Paleocene to the Eocene.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Johnson also gave the example of a fossil find that included &#8220;two bull mammoths who were locked in a fight,&#8221; their tusks intertwined, grappling until they fell down together, and &#8220;squished a coyote&#8221; as they did.&nbsp; The trio was fossilized in Nebraska, and in the book Troll illustrates the scene.
</p>
<p>
While Johnson and Troll were searching for fossils, they came across many colorful characters.&nbsp; In many little towns they stopped in, they found people who specialized in collecting the characteristic fossil of the region.&nbsp; They met a Mormon patriarch named Lloyd Gunther, who said he had 120 kids and grandkids, and &#8220;all of them are trilobite hunters,&#8221; seeking fossils of the popular extinct arthropod in the Utah rock.
</p>
<p>
Johnson also gave a possible scientific explanation behind the<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackalope" title=" Jackalope"> Jackalope</a>.&nbsp; &#8220;In 1981, the Governor of Wyoming declared the Jackalope the official Mythical Beast of Wyoming,&#8221; Johnson noted.&nbsp; In Douglas, Wyoming, where a large Jackalope statue is on display, in the nearby rocks, Johnson said, &#8220;you find all these weird little deerlike animals of the myocene and oligicene,&#8221; that are somewhat suggestive of Jackalopes.
<br />
 
<br />
During the question and answer period, a woman asked about how paleontology has affected Johnson&#8217;s spiritual outlook.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s just great to imagine that the planet has so much going on,&#8221; Johnson replied, &#8220;constant evolution and change.&nbsp; Today&#8217;s plants and animals are only the latest chapter in an ongoing story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
A young man asked, &#8220;Have you ever found anything, like, sort of rat like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;If you go out with these paleomammologists,&#8221; Johnson replied, &#8220;all you ever find are things that are rat like,&#8221; In Patagonia, he added, scientists discovered a rodent the size of a rhinoceros.&nbsp; &#8220;If you want bad rats, go to South America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Troll and Johnson are currently mulling a South American sequel to <I>Cruisin&#8217; The Fossil Freeway</I> that would focus on either the Amazon or Patagonia.&nbsp; South America was an island for much of its past, Johnson explained, harboring &#8220;mammal evolution run as a completely separate experiment.&nbsp; You get things that looked like elephants that are not elephants, things that looked like horses that are not horses, saber-toothed marsupials.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The reality of the past is stranger than any science fiction,&#8221; Johnson said

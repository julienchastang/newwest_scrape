							<p>With snow predicted to fall again in Boulder this week, this winter has more than overstayed its welcome.&nbsp; But although the cold temperatures can hamper outdoor fun, the last few weeks of winter are an excellent time to take in some indoor cultural activities.
</p>
<p>
Tonight, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerwest.org" title="Center of the American West ">Center of the American West </a>hosts Sioux author, actor, screenplay writer, storyteller, and educator Joseph Marshall III at Old Main Chapel on CU Campus (February 18, 7:30 p.m., free).&nbsp; According to the Center, &#8220;His most recent publication, <i>Keep Going: The Art of Perseverance</i> (2006), attends to the power of perseverance through stories that stretch back across generations through the Lakota oral tradition.&#8221;  Marshall will speak and sign books after his presentation.
</p>
<p>
Over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedairy.org" title="the Dairy Center">the Dairy Center</a>, some local students are putting on a production of Ira Levin&#8217;s &#8220;Deathtrap.&#8221;  As explained in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/feb/11/teens-to-raise-the-curtain/" title="this Daily Camera article">this Daily Camera article</a>, Lisa Campbell and Danny Goldhaber, who are sophomores at Boulder High, wanted to be involved in all aspects of putting on a play, so they started their own theater company, &#8220;The Real Players,&#8221; and will raise the curtain on their first production on Friday. (February 22-23, 7:30 p.m., February 24, 2 &amp; 7:30 p.m., $9-$10).
</p>
<p>
If you&#8217;re looking for a good book, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mountainsplains.org" title="Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association">Mountains &amp; Plains Independent Booksellers Association</a> recently announced the winners of its 2007 Regional Book Awards.&nbsp; Hampton Sides won for adult nonfiction with his well-publicized <i>Blood and Thunder</i>, but there are some lesser-known books on the list, such as adult fiction winner <i>Cottonwood Saints</i> by Gene Guerin, a book that was published by University of New Mexico Press.&nbsp; This year&#8217;s Spirit of the West Award will be presented to Linda Hogan, who taught in CU&#8217;s creative writing program for several years.
</p>
<p>
Are flowers art?&nbsp; Well, anyway, the man responsible for the glorious year-round displays of flowers on the Pearl Street Mall is retiring, and Bill Scanlon recently wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5355395,00.html" title="a nice profile of him">a nice profile of him</a> for the Rocky Mountain News.&nbsp; It won&#8217;t be long now until daffodil and tulip season&#8230;I hope.

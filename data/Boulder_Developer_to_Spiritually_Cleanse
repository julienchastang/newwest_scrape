							In Sunday's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com" title="Denver Post,">Denver Post,</a> Margaret Jackson reported an interesting Boulder tidbit in her <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_3871020" title="Real Estate Notes">Real Estate Notes</a> column:<br />
<br />
"Boulder developer Scott Woodard is hiring Ceremonies for Sacred Living to 'cleanse' a mortuary he plans to redevelop into condominiums. Woodard, of Fit Properties, also hired an energy consultant to evaluate the building that formerly housed Howe Mortuary at 11th and Spruce in downtown Boulder. The consultant found that the building has positive energy and that people who worked at the mortuary provided a service to the community.  The project, expected to be completed next summer, will include three condos in the existing building, an addition to the building that will have one unit and two newly constructed stand-alone units. Prices for the condos range from $825,000 to $2.5 million."<br />
<br />
This brought several issues to mind: First, it's clear that one can make an extravagant enough living from developing Boulder property to have enough extra cash to hire all the "energy consultants" and New Age ritual practitioners one could want.  Second, the souls prepared for burial at this morturary seem to be at peace according to the "energy consultant," but will they continue their blissful existence in the afterlife when they realize the prices that the condos are going for?  My guess is the first person who plunks down $2.5 million for one of these units will find himself haunted by ghosts of modest means from Boulder's past.  This project could be the best example yet of an effort that unifies the hippie/New Age culture of Boulder's past with the wealthy newcomers of its present.<br />
<br />
I tried to find more information on the company "Ceremonies for Sacred Living," but its website is a little cryptic--or maybe I just need a New-Age-O-Speak decoder ring to make sense of it.  This service is apparently offered by the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestarhouse.org" title="The Star House">The Star House</a>, which is located near Boulder in Sunshine Canyon.  It's a lively community apparently, offering all manner of workshops and ceremonies, such as "Moon Impulse: Creating Safety in Nature," a "Spirit Adventure Quest," and a Summer Solstice celebration.<br />
<br />
As for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestarhouse.org/CSL.html" title=""Ceremonies for Sacred Living,"">"Ceremonies for Sacred Living,"</a> the people at the Star House seem flexible enough to accomodate any request: "It is our intention to bring meaningful ritual into all of life’s transitional moments, honoring the celebrations and challenges of the individual, community, family and Spirit. We provide a starting point in the form of “templates” for the type of ritual to be created, and then customize the ritual with you. You are an equal partner in this creation; we provide experience and support for your ritual dream and vision. No matter what your particular religious or spiritual beliefs, we can help you to incorporate them into your ceremony to the depth you choose. Use our space at The StarHouse or your Sacred space, wherever that may be.  Ceremonies begin at $150 for a 90 minute ceremony --this includes 1-10 participants with one Ceremonialist . Please e-mail us so we may tailor a quote for you that meets your ceremonial needs."  <br />
<br />
Only $150 for a 90-minute ceremony?  Wealthy developers probably spend more a week on lattes.  And what's mere pocket change when restoring the harmony of the spirit world is at stake?

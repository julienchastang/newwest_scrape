								Famed distance runner Frank Shorterâ€”scheduled to read from Frank Watersâ€™ <i>The Man Who Killed the Deer</i>â€”was a no-show, but there were still plenty of prominent Boulderites on hand at CUâ€™s Old Main last night to read inspiring and humorous passages of western literature at the ninth annual <i>Words to Stir the Soul</i>, organized by the Center of the American West. Patricia Limerick, the CU history professor, specialist in all things Western, and 1995 MacArthur Fellow, hosted the event, kicking it off with readings from two men she said came from â€œthe fine western tradition of incorporating humor into political dialogue,â€? a tradition she said was in need of revitalization. She read a passage from former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpsonâ€™s <i>Right In The Old Gazoo</i>, and shared a few of the jokes former Arizona congressman Morris Udall was fond of telling, including one about a businessman on an airplane who ordered a scotch and soda from a stewardess. When the stewardess asked the man seated next to the businessman if heâ€™d like to order an alcoholic beverage, he blustered, â€œI am a minister of the gospel and would rather commit adultery than have a drink.â€?  The businessman then turned to the stewardess and said, â€œOh, I didnâ€™t realize we had a choice.â€?<br />
<br />
	The selections of the eleven other participants were extremely varied, ranging from settings in Alaska, Montana, Texas, and Colorado, and including nonfiction, poetry, and fiction.  James Williams, CUâ€™s Dean of Libraries, read from David Lavenderâ€™s <i>The Way to the Western Sea: Lewis and Clark Across the Continent</i>, and noted that CU had recently acquired Lavenderâ€™s papers for its collection.  Lorenzo Trujillo, Assistant Dean of CUâ€™s School of Law, read from a book written by his mother, Marie Oralia DurÃ¡n Trujillo, <i>Autumn Memories: My New Mexican Roots and Traditions</i>. One story was that of the days when Hispanics in rural Brighton, Colorado were segregated to the left side of the movie theater. Her father brought a discrimination claim against the theater and won, but the people were â€œso used to sitting with our friends on the left side, we continued to sit there.â€?<br />

	Dr. George Russell is local dermatologist, but many would have mistaken him for a cowboy last night as he donned a cowboy hat and bandana, sang a haunting, lonesome campfire tune, and read the lovelorn cowpoke poem â€œA Bad Half Hourâ€? by Badger Clark. Another highlight was Reg Sanerâ€™s reading from his forthcoming book <i>Desert Savvy</i>.  Saner is a long-time essayist on the west and former CU English professorâ€”I particularly enjoyed his crystalline book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biblio.com/books/7997888.html" title="The Four-Cornered Falcon: Essays on the Interior West and the Natural Scene">The Four-Cornered Falcon: Essays on the Interior West and the Natural Scene</a>â€”and he always writes with clarity, passion, and great humor, setting the scene of the natural landscape with precision.  Judging from the excerpt Saner read, <i>Desert Savvy</i> should be a hootâ€”he told the tale of time spent as a backpacker in the desert, beleaguered by gnats and troubled by the realization that â€œin the desert, shade is largely nocturnal.â€?  <br />

	Law Professor Charles Wilkinson chose to read an excerpt from Wallace Stegner that has become a sort of motto for the Center of the American West. Wilkinson noted that the late Stegner was honored to have the centerâ€™s annual award for prominent Westerners named after him and was very interested in how CU could become a great national university while still remaining Western at its core. Wilkinson read a succinct passage from Stegnerâ€™s <i>The Sound of Mountain Water</i> that eloquently expresses an idea many Westerners would likely agree with: â€œAngry as one may be at what careless people have done and still do to a noble habitat, it is hard to be pessimistic about the West. This is the native home of hope. When it finally learns that cooperation, not rugged individualism, is the pattern that most characterizes and preserves it, then it will have achieved itself and outlived its origins. Then it has a chance to create a society to match the scenery.â€?<br />

		<h1>Signs of Spring: Regional Writers on Book Tours</h1>

							<p>The beginnings of a spring thaw must have mobilized the region&#8217;s writers, because most of what I have to report today has to do with regional book tours:
</p>
<p>
&#8226; Denver author <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caralopezlee.com/" title="Cara Lopez Lee">Cara Lopez Lee</a> will visit Fact &amp; Fiction in Missoula at 7 p.m. tonight to discuss her memoir <I>They Only Eat Their Husbands: A Memoir of Alaskan Love, World Travel, and the Power of Running Away</I> (Ghost Road Press, $19.95). The publisher describes the book in this way:
</p>
<p>
&#8220;At twenty-six, after a lover threatens to kill her, Cara runs away to Alaska. In the Last Frontier she lands in a love triangle with two alcoholics: Sean the martial artist and Chance the paraglider pilot. Nine years later, sick of love, she runs again, to backpack around the world alone. <I>They Only Eat Their Husbands</I> is a memoir of her yearlong trek, against a backdrop of reflections on her life and loves in Alaska.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Lopez Lee is on what her website describes as a &#8221;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.caralopezlee.com/events.php" title="book tour adventure">book tour adventure</a>,&#8221; with an upcoming stop in Seattle and several in Alaska, including her Alaska Book Release party at The Woodshed in Anchorage (March 26, 7 p.m.). In April, she&#8217;ll head to New Mexico to conduct Girls Trek Too Workshops at the REIs in Albuquerque (April 13) and Santa Fe (April 14).

&#8226; Get your tickets now for the annual Evil Companions Literary Award on April 14 at the Oxford Hotel in Denver. This year&#8217;s recipient is the accomplished, Denver-raised Ted Conover, whose works of narrative journalism include <I>Rolling Nowhere: Riding the Rails with America&#8217;s Hoboes</I>, <I>Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing</I>, which won the NBCC Award, and his most recent book, <I>The Routes of Man: How Roads Are Changing the World and the Way We Live Today</I>. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denverpost.com/rss/ci_17533505?source=rss" title="recent Denver Post column">recent Denver Post column</a>, David Milofsky, one of the founders of Denver&#8217;s oldest literary award, explains how the prize with the funny name came about. Milofsky reports there have been some quibbles over the years about whether the winners have been &#8220;Western&#8221; enough, and notes that founder Dana Crawford has said, &#8220;Only Jim Harrison was truly evil.&#8221; By all accounts, Ted Conover is not at all evil but a completely worthy recipient for this mid-career achievement award. Tickets are available from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dplfriends.org/events/evil.html" title="Denver Public Library Friends Foundation">Denver Public Library Friends Foundation</a> ($60-$150). The event kicks off at 6 p.m. (As of Monday, there were only 50 tickets left, so act fast.)

		<b>Comment By James Work, 3-28-11</b>
		<p>You're on the radio at MPR (NPR!) this week. Best wishes for a satisfying experience! Do they do these by remote connection these days, or must you travel to Montana? Any surprise questions? (I did a couple of NPR local interviews many years back and thoroughly enjoyed myself except for a couple of call-in questions from listeners who hadn't read the book.)<br />

		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 3-28-11</b>
		<p>Thanks, James! It was a blast to be on The Write Question. I went to the KGNU studio in Boulder to record the interview with Cherie Newman. The only question I was surprised about was when she asked what the title meant--duh, I should have expected that one! It's just that the book had a different title for seven years while I was writing it, and my agent gave it a new title. Also, no one had ever asked me about my book before--usually I ask the questions--so that was a new and fun experience.<br />

							Ashley Powers of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-dinosaurs27aug27,0,3988775,full.story?coll=la-home-local" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> recently reported on a disturbing phenomenon that began in the South and is sweeping westward across the country: creationists are setting up roadside pseudo-museums to promulgate their view that dinosaurs romped with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden about 6,000 years ago, then were wiped out by Noahâ€™s flood.  Sure, the majority of creationists now seem to concede that dinosaurs did indeed exist, and that their fossils are not merely â€œtricksâ€? that God sprinkled throughout the earth as a test of faith (once a popular creationist view), but theyâ€™re still pushing ideas that havenâ€™t prevailed among scientists for two-hundred years. Whatâ€™s worse is a lot of them are home schooling children in this benighted view of dinosaurs, which borders on child abuse in my book.  Powers reports creationists in Cabazon, California constructed a roadside dinosaur attraction because, as Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis said, dinosaurs are â€œused to teach people that thereâ€™s no God, and theyâ€™re used to brainwash people.  Evolutionists get very upset when we use dinosaurs.  Thatâ€™s their star.â€?<br />
<br />
As a westerner, I feel a special kinship with these creatures who roamed our land beginning in the Mesozoic era, 245 million years ago, and left so many evident traces in our geologic record.  The Rocky Mountain region enjoys a fossil bonanza precisely because of its particular past: for most of its geologic history, the region underwent deposition, the process through which sediments accumulate, especially in low-lying areas, as they did when the region was covered with an inland sea during the Precambrian era.  (I regularly admire the ripple marks left from this watery past on the side of a cliff at Dowdy Draw open space in Boulder.)  Relatively recently, the area (including the high plains to Coloradoâ€™s east) popped up through a still-inexplicable regional uplift event, occurring in the late tertiary within the last 10 million years.  This pop-up made long-buried fossils more accessible.  Plus, we have none of that pesky vegetation that chokes so much of the country, hiding the earthâ€™s geologic wealth. The paucity of vegetation makes it easy for even non-scientists to learn how to read the rocks and figure out where fossils are likely to be found. So it irks me whenever I read about people denying our earthâ€™s fascinating history.  The creationists can have Kansas if they want, but they canâ€™t have my dinosaurs. <br />
<br />
Last year, Lynette Clemetson wrote in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wehaitians.com/darwin%20free%20fun%20for%20creationists.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> about a creationist theme park, Dinosaur Adventure Land, in Pensacola, Florida. Apparently a handful of such attractions are turning up throughout the South, most notably including an in-the-works $25 million creationism museum being constructed in Petersburg, Kentucky. But more disturbingly, last year Leon Jaroff wrote in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,783829,00.html" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a> about creationist activities brewing right in our rock-rich backyardâ€”according to Jaroff, due to pressure by the Bush administration, the National Park Service-run gift shop in the Grand Canyon is selling Tom Vailâ€™s <i>Grand Canyon, A Different View</i>, a book that holds that the canyon was formed by Noahâ€™s flood 4,500 years ago.  When searching the internet, I came across a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sixdaycreation.com/facts/dinosaurs/nov2002.html" title="press release">press release</a> that would be laughable if it werenâ€™t so sickâ€”in 2002 an expedition of home-schooled youngsters, led by the groups Vision Forum and Creation Expeditions, turned up the intact fossil remains of an Allosaurus in the Skull Creek Basin of northwest Colorado.  The expedition leaders included Doug Phillips, who apparently is an adjunct professor of the venerable field of â€œapologeticsâ€? at the Institute for Creation Research (insert your own joke here).  Another pseudo-scientist along for the expedition, Peter DeRosa, claimed that upon examination of the Allosaurus remains, "the evidence strongly points to a relatively recent and catastrophic event similar to that described in the Bible as the Flood of Noah's day."<br />
<br />
The press release makes it sound like these organizations are combing the West, trying to dig up as many fossils as they can to liberate them from the tyranny of evolutionists.  Is this what itâ€™s come toâ€”whoever digs up a fossil has the right to attach whatever specious theory he wants to it?  So if I find an Allosaurus tomorrow, I can issue a press release detailing how fairies tucked it into the earth two weeks ago?  For people who find their faith in evolution slipping in these heady times, I highly recommend a bracing class in the history of our regionâ€™s geology such as those regularly offered by the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The extremely entertaining geologist Dr. Bob Raynolds regularly teaches an excellent class called â€œReading Planet Earth,â€? but this semester heâ€™s focusing on the equally riveting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmns.org/main/en/General/Education/AdultProgram/Classes/Programs/waterWestClass.htm" title="Water in the Rocky Mountain West">Water in the Rocky Mountain West</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmns.org/main/en/General/Education/AdultProgram/Classes/Programs/waterFrontClass.htm" title="Water in the Front Range">Water in the Front Range</a>. For an overview of regional paleontology, I recommend a class Iâ€™ve taken, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmns.org/main/en/General/Education/AdultProgram/Classes/Programs/paleontologyWesternClass.htm" title="Paleontology of the Western Interior">Paleontology of the Western Interior</a>, which will begin in October, taught by Kirk Johnson, the chief curator and chair of the museumâ€™s Department of Earth Sciences.<br />
<br />
And if anyone should dig up my bones 200 years from now, please let it be a believer in evolution.

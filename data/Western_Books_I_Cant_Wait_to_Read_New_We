							<p>Jane Ciabattari at Critical Mass, the National Book Critics Circle&#8217;s blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://bookcriticscircle.blogspot.com/2008/08/thinking-about-new-orleans-questions.html" title="recently interviewed one of my favorite writers, ZZ Packer">recently interviewed one of my favorite writers, ZZ Packer</a>, in advance of her August 28 appearance at a fundraiser for Katrina victims.&nbsp; They discussed Packer&#8217;s links to New Orleans, but what interested me most was this tidbit: &#8220;The novel I&#8217;m finishing (yes, finally, finishing!) concerns the Buffalo soldiers, and the regiment whose storyline I follow were mustered in just outside of New Orleans and the whole first third is set there, so I&#8217;ve been NOLA-centered for quite some time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Packer has been working on this Buffalo soldier novel for a while&#8212;when I interviewed her for <I>The Onion</I> back in 2003 during her tour for her story collection <I>Drinking Coffee Elsewhere</I>, she said she already had written several hundred pages, and she was planning to spend some time in New Mexico writing and researching some settings.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Ever since then, I have been waiting for word of when this novel was going to be published.&nbsp; But, impatient as I am to read it, I respect her for taking all the time she&#8217;s needed when other writers might have rushed a manuscript in such hot demand through completion.&nbsp; Packer&#8217;s forthcoming Buffalo soldier novel tops my list of books with western settings that I am most eager to read.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Also on my list is the eventual debut book of Daniel Orozco, a short story writer who teaches at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.class.uidaho.edu/english/CW/cwfaculty.html" title="University of Idaho">University of Idaho</a>.&nbsp; I first read his work in the <I>Best American Short Stories 1995</I>, which featured his story &#8220;Orientation,&#8221; a hilarious account of office cubical life.&nbsp; I encountered his work periodically, such as in the late, great <I>Story</I> magazine which featured Orozco&#8217;s story &#8220;Hunger Tales&#8221; in one of its final issues back in 1998.&nbsp; Since then, Orozco has won awards from the NEA, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lannan.org/lf/bios/detail/daniel-orozco/" title="Lannan Foundation">Lannan Foundation</a>, and the Idaho Commission on the Arts, and I&#8217;ve been expecting a collection, but I haven&#8217;t heard anything about it.&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;ll just keep waiting and snap it up as soon as possible when it does appear.

Is anyone else out there waiting impatiently for a new book by your favorite writers?&nbsp; If so, leave a comment and let me know what book you can&#8217;t wait to read.

An amazing woman, Elizabeth Geiser, started the Denver program 30 years ago and recently retired, handing over the reins to the one-and-only Joyce Meskis, owner of the one-and-only Tattered Cover Bookstore. Denver&#8217;s Jill Smith and Sandra Bond keep the intense schedule on track, and that sked is two weeks of editorial workshops (kicked off by a keynote speech from a publishing dynamo like Dominique Raccah of Sourcebooks), a week for marketing and finally, a week of career focus, including interviews with HR folks from several publishing houses, small and large.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

		<b>Comment By Michael Bartley, 8-20-08</b>
		<p>I've been hearing about and looking forward to a new novel from Laura Pritchett called  Blue Moon Mountain (if that's still the title).<br />
Dan Flores' The Sacred Circle: Indians and Buffalo in the American West is a history I've been waiting on for over ten years. I am interested in his upcoming work on art and artists in the West but sure would like to read his buffalo book. Come on Dan publish the damn thing.<br />
I am a big fan of Charles Bowden and always look forward to a new full length work.<br />
Wish Bass and Proulx would write more novels, Harrison's new novel coming this fall. Shoot, the list goes on and on. <br />
Also, wondering about a young writer with talent to burn named Jenny Shank. Got a publisher yet?</p>
		
		<b>Comment By Jenny Shank, 8-20-08</b>
		<p>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Those are all good books to be anticipating. I should also mention Thomas McGuane--I loved his last short story collection so much, I can't wait for the next one.<br />
<br />
As for my book, thanks for the vote of confidence!  I'm still revising and hoping something will work out someâ€¦year.  You can bet when I do wrangle a book deal, I'll be too excited to prevent myself from sharing the news here.</p>
		
		<b>Comment By poe, 8-21-08</b>
		<p>Can't wait to read Terry Tempest Williams newest - "Finding Beauty in a Broken World: A Mosaic."  Terry read from the manuscript this Spring in Bluff and the writing was amazing - as was the woman.  It finally hits the shelves in October!</p>

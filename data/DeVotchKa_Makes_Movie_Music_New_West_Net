							Theatergoers who have begun seeing the trailer for the forthcoming <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_5089.html" title="Everything Is Illuminated">Everything Is Illuminated</a> may be wondering what band is responsible for its haunting music: itâ€™s none other than Boulderâ€™s beloved <a target="_blank" href="http://www.devotchka.net" title="DeVotchKa">DeVotchKa</a>, with frontman Nick Urataâ€™s soaring voice matching Roy Orbisonâ€™s for range on the track â€œHow It Ends,â€? the title song from the bandâ€™s superb 2004 disc.<br />
<br />
Eugene HÃ¼tz, the frontman of New York Cityâ€™s similarly-styled Gogol Bordello, stars opposite Elijah Wood in <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i>, which is based on Jonathan Safran Foerâ€™s blockbuster novel. Not only does DeVotchKaâ€™s music fit right in with the Eastern European setting of the film and Safran Foerâ€™s romantic, postmodern aesthetic, but the members of DeVotchKa have long been chummy with the members of Gogol Bordello, so the pairing was a perfect fit. <br />
<br />
DeVotchKaâ€™s management reports that downloads of â€œHow It Endsâ€? on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/" title="iTunes">iTunes</a> have increased 300% since the trailer began airing a few weeks ago.  Itâ€™s about time that the movie world started taking notice of DeVotchKa; the bandâ€™s music has always been cinematic, with each song evoking a distinct setting and ambiance.  And when it rains, it pours apparently: DeVotchKa is now at work scoring the feature film <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/" title="Little Miss Sunshine">Little Miss Sunshine</a>, directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and starring Steve Carell and Toni Collette. According to the IMDB, the movie is due out next year, and concerns â€œa family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant [who] take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.â€? The members of DeVotchKa are no strangers to beauty: a couple of years ago they provided the backing music for the national BurlesqueFest tour, a showcase of the nationâ€™s top retro striptease performance artists.<br />
<br />
Devotchka will play at Boiseâ€™s Neurolux on August 30 and Denverâ€™s Bluebird Theater on September 9.

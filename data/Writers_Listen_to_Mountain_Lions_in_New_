I picture Rick Bass and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.barrylopez.com/" title="Barry Lopez">Barry Lopez</a> sitting side by side at a desk in a spare cabin in the wilderness, dressed in their anthology superhero outfits: identical red plaid shirts.&nbsp; A light on the telephone between them starts blinking.&nbsp; They meet each other&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the Western anthology hotline, summoning them for duty.&nbsp; Lopez reaches for the receiver.&nbsp; &#8220;Lopez here,&#8221; he says. &#8220;What&#8217;s the assignment?&nbsp; Ptarmigan? Alpine bryum moss?&#8221;  He waits.&nbsp; &#8220;Cougars?&#8221;  He and Bass begin to laugh.&nbsp; &#8220;Give us ten minutes,&#8221; Lopez says, hanging up the phone.&nbsp; Bass cracks his knuckles, opens a notebook, takes up his pen, and gets to work.
</p>
<p>
Almost every anthology I&#8217;ve read this year that has something to do with the West has featured an essay by Bass or Lopez or both.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.upcolorado.com/bookdetail.asp?isbn=978-0-87081-894-3" title="Listening to Cougar">Listening to Cougar</a>, a new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.upcolorado.com" title="University Press of Colorado">University Press of Colorado</a> anthology about mountain lions, is no exception.&nbsp; But maybe certain writers&#8217; lives are not quite the way I like to imagine them: both Bass&#8217;s and Lopez&#8217;s essays are reprints.&nbsp; Bass&#8217;s excellent yarn about how his one-year-old pup confronted a 250-pound puma in Montana is an excerpt from his 1998 dog memoir <I>Brown Dog of the Yaak</I>, and Lopez&#8217;s reverie on the floundering wildlife in and around a drought-stricken Oregon river is taken from 1979&#8217;s <I>River Notes: The Dance of the Herons</I>.
</p>
<p>
Still, even if there is no anthology hotline, plenty of other talented writers answered the call for this book with fresh material, and it provides a fine meditation on the cougar, including biological, historical, spiritual, and personal perspectives.&nbsp; As several of the essayists note, the <I>Puma concolor</I> is an animal of many names: cougar, mountain lion, puma, panther, catamount.&nbsp; It&#8217;s an animal that has always loomed large in the minds of the people who have lived within its range, from Native Americans who revered it and included it in their cosmologies (as Steve Pavlik details in his essay &#8220;The Sacred Cat"), to modern day Front Rangers who track it or keep a wary eye out for it.
</p>
<p>
According to the biographical notes, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Frank_Dobie" title="J. Frank Dobie">J. Frank Dobie</a> is &#8220;considered the first truly professional writer to hail from Texas,&#8221; and his fascinating essay &#8220;Lion Markers&#8221; was originally published in 1928.&nbsp; Dobie writes of a cougar hunting expedition he joined in Beaverhead, New Mexico, and passes along much of the lore he gleaned from mountain lion hunting experts, the Evans brothers, who pursued cougars with the help of &#8220;remarkable dogs.&#8221;  The easiest way to spot the elusive mountain lion, the men agreed, was through finding its prey.&nbsp; 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we could find a fresh kill,&#8221; Dobie writes, &#8220;we were reasonably certain of jumping the killer.&nbsp; He might stay away from it for a night, but the chances were ninety to ten that he would return the next night, eat, leave a fresh trail, and be lying up somewhere near when the dogs were turned loose in the vicinity at dawn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
&#8220;A Puma&#8217;s Journey&#8221; by Linda Sweanor, a Colorado cougar ecologist, was another essay that taught me several things I didn&#8217;t know.&nbsp; Sweanor, who has studied cougars for over a decade, describes how young male mountain lions must disperse after they are weaned, seeking their own territory.&nbsp; &#8220;Newly independent male pumas have a strong urge to travel,&#8221; she writes.&nbsp; &#8220;Whether aggressive, territorial adult males instigate dispersal or if it is more deeply programmed in the cat&#8217;s genetics, these felid teenagers typically travel over one hundred kilometers from their birth site before establishing a territory of their own.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>
Sweanor writes that two of the longest documented dispersal distances were those of a male that traveled 480 kilometers from his birthplace in Wyoming to Colorado, and another who was born in South Dakota&#8217;s Black Hills and died 960 kilometers away in Oklahoma.
</p>
<p>
While some assume that increased cougar sightings in far-flung places (such as eastern Nebraska, where my aunt spotted a mountain lion on her farm) must indicate a thriving population, some of the scientists in <I>Listening to Cougar</I> argue that it&#8217;s cougars&#8217; need to disperse, and increasingly limited uninhabited stretches of land, that have caused the increase in human-cougar contacts.&nbsp; No one knows for certain what the North American cougar population is--as many essayists note, the cougar&#8217;s elusiveness is practically its defining quality.
</p>
<p>
Still, some of the essayists in this collection have seen them so often you&#8217;d think they were stuffing their pockets with catnip.&nbsp; Christina Kohlruss writes in &#8220;To Cry for Vision&#8221; about how just about every time she heads into the wilderness on a &#8220;vision quest,&#8221; a mountain lion comes to call on her.
</p>
<p>
Editor <a target="_blank" href="http://literati.net/Bekoff/" title="Marc Bekoff">Marc Bekoff</a>, who is a professor of biology at the University of Colorado, writes with good humor and insight about his several cougar encounters in &#8220;A Lion, A Fox, and A Funeral.&#8221; Bekoff has often played the role of town crier when he&#8217;s spotted a cougar in his Boulder neighborhood around homes where small children live.&nbsp; Once when he was out to warn a neighbor about a cougar, he practically walked right into the animal, and writes, &#8220;I was terrified and ran up the hillside, in my clogs, yelling all the way, &#8216;There&#8217;s a lion here, there&#8217;s a lion here!&#8217;&#8221;  Bekoff realizes that in responding to his primal fear and hightailing it out of there, he violated some of the rules that are included in the appendix &#8220;Cougar County Safety Tips.&#8221;  He writes:
<br />
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;I remember going to sleep that night imagining a headline in the local paper saying something like &#8216;University of Colorado Carnivore Expert who Ran from a Cougar Gets Maimed&#8212;What Was He Thinking?&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
Many of the essayists are awe-inspired by their encounters with mountain lions, and turn to the realm of spiritual belief to help them comprehend the incident.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://bkloren.com/" title="BK Loren">BK Loren</a> combined her knowledge of cougars gained from a winter spent tracking them for Colorado State Parks with Jung&#8217;s theory of the collective unconscious into her thought-provoking essay, &#8220;The Shifting Light of Shadows.&#8221;  She writes about how after months of tracking cougars without seeing them, she spotted a mountain lion out in the open on the tennis courts in Chautauqua Park in Boulder.&nbsp; She compares the cougar to one of Jung&#8217;s archetypes, &#8220;the Shadow,&#8221; which &#8220;holds within it all our internal repressed fears&#8221; and riffs on one of the animal&#8217;s names, &#8220;the shadow cat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Loren&#8217;s is the kind of spiritual writing I like: bracing, questioning rather than certain, and specific.&nbsp; Less successful in this vein, to me, was Suzanne Duarte&#8217;s &#8220;My Bush Soul, The Mountain Lion,&#8221; in which she shared her many mountain lion-themed dreams, along with her interpretations of them.&nbsp;   
</p>
<p>
Encountering a mountain lion is a rare occurrence, being attacked by one still rarer.&nbsp; Cougars have killed <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_cougar_attacks_in_North_America_by_decade" title="only eighteen people">only eighteen people</a> in the North America since 1890.&nbsp; Still, parents of young children who live in cougar country should avoid reading the detailed appendix &#8220;Deaths by Cougar Attack, 1890-Present&#8221; before bedtime.
</p>
<p>
I saw a mountain lion once.&nbsp; A few years ago was riding on the Peak to Peak Highway, and noticed a huge animal emerge from the trees on the side of the road.&nbsp; I could scarcely believe what I was seeing, and when I got home, I sketched the silhouette of what I&#8217;d seen to try to confirm it: an enormous, golden cat with a tail as long as its body floating out behind it, its movements smooth as smoke.&nbsp; Okay, I saw it only for a second, from the safety of my car.&nbsp; This story isn&#8217;t likely to impress Rick Bass or Barry Lopez.&nbsp; But everyone in cougar country is entitled to his or her mountain lion story, and that one&#8217;s mine.
</p>
<p>
As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cougarfund.org/board.php#2" title="Cara Blessley Lowe">Cara Blessley Lowe</a> writes in her introduction: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Cougars can powerfully call forth our innermost fears because it is on this very edge that cougars reside in our psyches, straddling both fear and awe.&nbsp; We want to see one&#8212;even just a glimpse, just once&#8212;yet we don&#8217;t want to be confronted with a situation outside of our control.&nbsp; But rarely are encounters with cougars on human terms.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>
<p>
By those standards, my brief, safe sighting was a wish come true, and I&#8217;ll happily content myself with reading about more up-close-and-personal lion encounters in <I>Listening to Cougar</I>.

		<b>Comment By Brodie Farquhar, 11-26-07</b>
		<p>I haven't confirm this tail, so I won't use real names, but it makes for an intriguing anecdote.<br />
It seems a noted biologist who tracks radio-collared cougars went out into the woods to update his slide collection, and had a friend take a picture of him holding a radio antenna device.<br />
The image went straight into a slide show, with just enough cursory examination to make sure it was right-side-up.<br />
When the enlarged image came up on a big screen, the audience gasped and the biologist got his first good look at the slide.<br />
There he was, standing with his antenna before a big tree, and twenty feet above his head, in the tree, was the face of a mountain lion peeking out of the branches, right behind him.</p>

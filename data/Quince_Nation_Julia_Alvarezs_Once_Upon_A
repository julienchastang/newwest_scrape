	As a white person who grew up in Denver immersed in Mexican-American culture <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/latinos_describe_how_i_learned_english_in_new_essay_collection/C39/L39/" title="by virtue of the schools I attended">by virtue of the schools I attended</a>, it has been interesting to me to see how long it has taken certain aspects of Latino American life to enter the consciousness of society at large.&nbsp; Take the quincea&#241;era: while this tradition of an elaborate birthday celebration and coming out ritual for 15-year-old Latinas has been going on for decades, recently it has been in the spotlight, turning up in a well-received independent movie (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451176/" title="Quincea&#241;era">Quincea&#241;era</a>), in a TV reality show (MTV&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/sweet_16/series.jhtml" title="My Super Sweet Sixteen">My Super Sweet Sixteen</a>), and now as the subject of a book by the engaging Dominican-American writer Julia Alvarez.
</p>
<p>
Before I read Alvarez&#8217;s book, I didn&#8217;t know all the particulars, but I had sensed that the quince phenomenon had evolved from the simple party some of my classmates held in the early &#8216;90s into the elaborate fete with required weekly dance lessons for a 28-member court such as the one the young Denver woman I mentored participated in a few years ago.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
In <I>Once Upon A Quincea&#241;era</I>, Alvarez thoroughly investigates the quince trend from sociological, historical, pop-cultural, and personal perspectives, and she clarifies some of the myths that have sprung up around it, such as the idea that quincea&#241;eras are based on ancient Aztec rites (there is some record of an Aztec ceremony for girls, but it doesn&#8217;t have much to do with the quince of today) and the notion that the quince tradition has been passed down through Latino families (Alvarez finds instead that many of the American quincea&#241;eras she attends are firsts for the family). 
</p>
<p>
Alvarez writes that the quince fits the pattern established by other invented traditions, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/index.shtml" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a>:&nbsp; &#8220;These invented traditions are likely to appear when a group is undergoing transformation and they serve as a way to legitimize and galvanize its members by establishing continuity with a past that may be largely fictitious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Alvarez didn&#8217;t have a quince herself, although as a teenager, she did participate in a debutante presentation in the Dominican Republic.&nbsp; She began her inquiry into quincea&#241;eras as a skeptic, believing money spent on these parties would be better used for the girls&#8217; education.&nbsp; She writes, &#8220;In a study conducted by the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cossmho.org/" title="COSSMHO">COSSMHO</a>) titled <I>The State of Hispanic Girls</I>, young Latinas topped the charts in rates of teen pregnancy, suicide attempts, school dropouts and substance abuse&#8221; and &#8220;close to one out of every three Hispanic female high school students has seriously considered suicide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
  Alvarez talked to a quince coach in Denver who told her out of the seven girls he worked with recently, &#8220;four invited him to their baby showers only a year after their quincea&#241;eras.&#8221;  This prompts Alvarez to wonder: &#8220;What on earth is there to celebrate?&#8221;
</p>
<p>
	Alvarez interviewed dozens of quincea&#241;eras (the word applies equally to the party and the girl being celebrated), their families, and photographers, bakers, planners, and dressmakers involved in the newly burgeoning quincea&#241;era industry, and found that often families struggling with debt and job loss spend much more than they can afford to throw an elaborate party. But, as Alvarez writes, &#8220;This happens only once.&nbsp; Poverty, on the other hand, can last a lifetime.&#8221;  Alvarez takes heart in the financial wisdom and community spirit of the Mexican-American tradition of designating sponsors for different parts of the ceremony, referred to as godparents--such as a madrina of the cake or a padrino of the DJ.
</p>
<p>
Alvarez structures her book around the story of one quincea&#241;era whose name she has changed to Monica (despite the girl&#8217;s longing for fame from this book by the woman she calls &#8220;my author.")  Monica lives in Queens, just a few blocks away from the apartment where Alvarez spent her teenage years.&nbsp; Alvarez interweaves the story of Monica&#8217;s party with chapters on the phenomenon of quincea&#241;eras in general, and she also dips into a memoir of her own adolescence and young womanhood, describing the awkwardness and yearning that she felt then, and reviewing her clashes with her mother and her many mistakes (including two divorces before she was thirty).
</p>
<p>
Although the autobiographical portions of the book occasionally leave the larger focus behind, these parts specifically illustrate why a young woman might need a quincea&#241;era at that age--to feel celebrated, regal, supported, and approved of at a time when the messages she receives from her family, friends and the media are contradictory.
</p>
<p>
Alvarez chronicles plenty of quince ridiculousness, such as the requisite Hummer Limo and the elaborate photo sessions, video montages, and dresses as expensive as wedding gowns.&nbsp; In the end, it is through the reflection on her own life and an enormous sympathy and admiration for the girls she meets that warms Alvarez&#8217;s heart--at least partially--toward the quincea&#241;era.&nbsp; Alvarez believes that some sort of coming-of-age ritual might be beneficial to young people, such as the spiritual preparation sponsored by Sister Angela Erevia, an Omaha-based nun who leads teenagers in retreats and reflection, and the Stay-in-School Quincea&#241;era program started by Ana Maria Schachtell in Idaho.
</p>
<p>
Whether quincea&#241;eras are beneficial or not, the phenomenon shows no signs of slowing down, and with girls of all ethnicities asking their parents to throw them, the vision of quince booster Isabella Mart&#237;nez Wall (of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bellaquinceanera.com/store/catalog/" title="bellaquinceanera.com">bellaquinceanera.com</a>) might one day be fulfilled: &#8220;Every girl should have one.&#8221;
